            "Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions.
