2016,"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore with Scoot. In March 2016 I booked a return fare to Bangkok for myself and my wife for a Scoot flight in October 2016. I received an email from Scoot around September changing the return date from 30/10/16 to 1/11/16. Unfortunately as a result I was unable to take the booking. The email from Scoot advised that they would refund the return trip cost. I have called them twice for the refund, each time taking at least 15-20 minutes to get through to their Philippine call centre. But still no refund. I am a frequent flyer member with Singapore Airlines and have flown with them often, found them so efficient. How can you associate themselves with Scoot, It brings them down.",1
2016,"My Scoot flight from Melbourne to Singapore was originally supposed to fly around 12pm but the night before our flight the airline e-mailed me that my flight has been rescheduled to depart around 9pm and land at 1am, but our flight landed around 2am. We have been waiting nearly for an hour to check in as the queue was extremely long. The aircraft was clean, nice legroom and a comfortable seat. Good Wi-fi connectivity, nice merchandisers and adequate staff service. Poor F&B because they gave us the wrong order and we were not allowed to choose our drinks so they gave us coke. As we touched down in Singapore, I went to the conveyor belt and found that the wheel of my Rimowa broke. We immediately went to the lost and found and the staff said that it's Scoot's policy that they are not responsible for any damage. Overall the service is good but the time management and the handling is poor.",0
2016,"Flew back from Amritsar to Singapore on 19th September. Scoot system was down at the airport and they said they had no proof to verify if we had prebooked luggage. We have stopped printing our tickets and our phone was dead. Check In staff then said to pay for the 30 kilos as excess luggage and claim refund in Singapore which did not make sense. As system was down, we waited 2 hours in the line while they manually wrote boarding passes. When we finally boarded, my sister felt sick and wanted to use to toilet. The staff said she was not allowed to as they were doing a physical headcount. I then asked them if I could purchase water for my sister and they said they will not begin selling till the plane took off.  I wrote to Scoot and all I got was the usual ""Apologise for the inconvenience caused"" answer with no reason why passengers were treated so inhumanely.",1
2016,"$500 round trip from Tokyo to Taipei for a family of four, was a steal and at the same time, too good to be true, we found out the hard way. Service on the plane was decent, attendants treated us with good manners and respect, responded to requests promptly, and was generally very accommodating to the passengers. Plane delayed for 8 hrs at Narita, since Scoot didn't have arrangements with other airlines and we didn't receive the notification email before arriving, we had to sit at the check-in area for 4 hours before being allowed to go through security where we spent an additional 5 hours. Flight was scheduled for 7pm departure but by 6:45pm, the plane was nowhere to be seen, they change the departure time at 7pm, very poorly communicated. Meal vouchers were provided, which was a slight plus. Because Scoot uses one plane to fly through 4 different routes (Brisbane to Tokyo to Taipei to Singapore), delays at any of the locations would cause delays to all rest. On top of that, with the tight turnaround schedule, they had no time to clean the planes. The bathrooms were disgusting. The plane seats were dirty,  not exactly the new plane they had advertised. Greediness also comes to mind looking at how much they charged for water/drinks along with their policy of no food on-board. Carry-on luggage policy is what I had serious issues with. We carried on the same amount of luggage arriving to Taiwan as we did departing but we were told we needed to keep the carry-on weight at 10kg and below for each. Why wasn't this policy enforced from Tokyo to Taipei? Instead of taking everything out of our carry-on, we decided to check our luggage instead but then had to pay $20 per kg after 20kg, so additional $200 was paid for carry-on. To make it more infuriating, the overhead bins were empty on the plane, which means, they forced most passengers to check their carry-on. Seating, coming back from Taiwan, for our family of 4, 2 adults two kids 3 and 5, they decided to separate us and had us in different rows on different sides of the plane. Had the plane been completely booked, we would've been fine with it but there were at least 30+ seats available next to each other by the time we departed. Mind-boggling to us and we just didn't understand why we were placed in different sections of the plane by the check-in agents.",1
2016,"Overall excellent service from Scoot, however disappointment arose due to the late arrival of the aircraft outbound from Singapore, causing a knock on effect for the inbound/return flight from Sydney. However the crew managed the delay very efficiently and well. Cabin attendants were friendly, highly attentive and warm, with a Singapore Airlines-esque manner/aporoach in their service, procedure and announcements. Seats were uncomfortable with the lowest version of economy class, lacking headrests. Inflight meals were tasty, healthy and fresh but not so filling for an 8 hour flight. Inflight entertainment choices were very limited and not worth its price value.",0
2016,"Taipei to Singapore with Scoot. I paid extra for 50% more leg room with my wife, but was allocated 2 seats (6J/K) with faulty meal trays. Mine was labeled with a sticker that sealed the cover of the tray, while my wife's seat had a slanting tray. I alerted the stewardess about the problem before the plane took off, but no action was taken. When the meals were served, the stewardess didn't know what to do. After a few mins, she came back and asked me to have my meal at the biz class seat while my wife was unattended. She was holding on to the food all the time until I finished eating. She was then asked to go over to biz class to have her meal. My wife was very furious with such arrangement and refused to eat and requested for a refund for the service paid but not delivered. 2 more stewardess came and said there is no refund policy. This is the worse experience I have with any airline. If the seats are faulty, Scoot should not charge extra for the 2 seats. My journey was ruined by the poor service.",1
2016,"Singapore to Taipei. My First trip on Scoot. Changed boarding gate at the last minute. Late departure (1.55am instead of 12.45am) Flight delayed (landed at 6.10am instead of 5.40am - usual landing not later than 5.15am). Took more than 20 minutes to exit from the aircraft (Row 43) due to the delay, I missed my 8.00am train from Taipei Main Station to Hualien.",0
2016,"Singapore to Perth and impressed. The flight was delayed a little but left not too far behind time and was only 20 minutes late into Perth. The seat in Scootbiz (4A/C) was equal to Qantas domestic business class less the seatback video which Qantas  has on most services. We had a drink and meal included in the price and the service wasn't that far off a legacy carrier. For the just under five hours run down to Perth, Scootbiz, at a third of the price of Qantas, wasn't too far off the pace. Service was very good from a hard working crew and while it wasn't what we'd experienced in Business with Qatar Airways on the four previous legs, it was a fraction of the price. Very professional service for the price.",0
2016,"Sydney to Hong Kong via Singapore. Fantastic experience on both routes - a very good welcome, cabin crew happy and very attentive to requests. Food was better than my husband and I have experienced on other airlines of equal standard in Economy. The seats were very comfortable and yes, there were no shutters on the windows, but a button under each window which has a way to darken the window itself. We had a brilliant experience and to our way of thinking, anyone who gives the airline a thumbs down, must be very hard to please.",0
2016,"Terrible check-in experience at the Melbourne Airport, don't expect a smooth process even if you are in business class. Our check-in bags came to 31.5kg, just 1.5kg over the allocated 30kg that came with the ScootBiz ticket. The airline ground check-in staff would not allow us 1-2 kg over for check-in baggage, even when we were on business class. The check-in staff were more interested in getting extra $$$ for the excess 2 kg with lots of fuss, hassles, toing and froing, they even forgot to ask basic security questions about the baggage content as you would expect check-in staff from other airlines to do. Also they don't have priority baggage tags for business class passengers like other airlines such as AirAsia. So much for paying the extra money for ScootBiz ticket, the check-in experience certainly did not feel business class. The airline's draconian strict baggage policy and the inexperienced check-in ground staff made the trip really unpleasant. Would not book with them again.",1
2016,"Flew from Melbourne to Singapore return with Scoot. Plane and flight were great, food is ok. Big disappointment is both my outbound and inbound flights got delayed by an hour due to operational requirements, whatever this means. It sounds like a paper work issue, which is disappointing as I assume this is in the airlines power and not caused by 3rd party or delayed inbound flight. Return was a 1.20am flight and there was no announcement of the delays till the flight was an 2 hours after boarding was meant to start. We were stuck in Singapore gate with 47 degree ""cold"" water to drink and no seats with 2 young kids, I would have happily stayed in the lounge I paid for.",0
2016,Perth to Singapore. Check in was swift. We had a slight delay due to no fault of Scoot but the incident was actioned quickly by the airport staff and we started boarding 30mins after the departing time. I was in the Scoot Silence zone and it was pleasant without much noise; you will still hear some from the other section. Having a headrest definitely helped. Cabin was clean and I did not have to interact with the crew really but they seemed nice. This is my 3rd flight with them this year and I will continue to use them.,0
2016,"Perth to Singapore, and upgraded to Scootbiz. Overall another great experience with Scoot. Love the priority boarding, friendly crew and the roomy seats. Only issue with these seats is that they are good if you are over 185 cm the head rest digs into your neck, the seats on the old Boeing 777 were actually more comfortable. You either have to sit lower in your seat, not comfortable or just having to cope with the head rest digging in. Flight on time, took off on time, as for entertainment take your own table and have your own movies. Food is ok and I think the whole experience is good value for money.",0
2016,"Gold Coast to Singapore. First time on Scoot and probably will not be the last. Booking via web site there is a small charge to pay by credit card but check all your details and add extras prior to travel as it could cost you a lot more on the day. I did receive an email 4 weeks from departure cancelling our flight and changing to 1 day later, after several attempts in contacting Scoot we changed to 3 days earlier (no charge but then had to outlay additional hotel costs in Singapore). The flight departed on time, Boeing 787, bright interior due to large windows, seat comfort Ok for the 7-8 hour flight, reclining seat with enough leg room, behind the seat pocket adequate. FA's were friendly, attentive and spoke good English. The aircraft is under 2 years old but the aisle carpet is very worn giving a cheap feel. Food and beverage selection ok - we only selected hot drink and  peanuts you could pay in AUS$. You board / leave via the runway using the stairs (no airbridge ) and bus, so be mindful if carrying bags and trying to hold on the rail - a lady in front missed the last step and went crashing into the bus - luckily no injury sustained. Overall this is a LCC and as such you pay for the quality and service - if you realise this prior to booking you should enjoy a cheaper way to travel.",0
2016,"Worst booking experience I have had. I originally booked a flight leaving Singapore to Bangkok at 17:45, a few weeks later I received a notification saying that the flight schedule will be changed and that my flight will now leave at 22:00. With the new flight times due to security ( according to one the unhelpful phone customer service representative), it will be impossible to make my flight connection onto Rome. I have contacted the airline several times but all they are willing to do is to waive the change fee and put me on a Tigerair flight paying the fare difference which funnily enough is way more expensive that if you were booking a completely new flight. Overall I feel angry, frustrated and robbed. Shame on you Scoot.",1
2016,"Singapore to Melbourne. The price was great, the aircraft new and the service efficient. Thats about as good as it gets. At 196cm tall the seat doesn't really fit me,  and the seat has a design flaw where the light and call assistance button is on the arm rest. Everyone hits it constantly.  Price of food was bearable but the choices weren't really tempting. I chose the most western item and it was passable but I have had better meals on Jetstar and AirAsia. I think they need to look at the Jetstar 787 and they can make some improvements. Wifi internet workable but a bit pricey.",0
2016,"I was travelling from Perth to Singapore with my 82 yr old mum who has problems walking. I was impressed by the service standards of a budget airline. I requested for a wheelchair when we checked in and was referred to the Service desk. The wheelchair was there in just a short while. We were escorted all the way through immigration, customs etc. My mum was finally wheeled to the aircraft for boarding and we were seated at Row 1. What impressed me most was to find that the wheelchair was waiting when we landed at Singapore. I also wish to extend a bouquet to the service staff who were attentive and really polite! Kudos to Scoot.",0
2016,"Singapore to Sydney with Scoot. Flight delayed by 6 hours. No notification from Scoot. Given a $10 food voucher as compensation, not even entry to the lounge as a business class passenger. No ground staff from Scoot itself in Singapore airport. Offered to be put in economy on flight to Melbourne and then no compensation for finding my way to Sydney. The incoming flight was supposed to leave Qingdao at 3.10pm and arrive at Changi at 8:50pm. They had stupid amounts of time to call or email to notify us of the delay. No reason given as to why they did not email or phone to notify. Food on the way to Singapore was terrible and service is quite average. They give you your meal in the first hour so for the next 7 to 8 hours you have to pay for everything else. Beware.",1
2016,"Brilliant daytime flight out of Gold Coast to Singapore with Scoot. We paid so little for this flight and he aircraft was new, the staff were lovely, and the food was good. Probably would not like to sleep in the seats but daytime is just great. This airline is such value for money with new aircraft and great routes.",0
2016,"Scoot is an excellent medium/long haul budget airline. I took ScootBiz from Sydney to Singapore and didn't expect a budget airline to be so comfortable. It had sufficient legroom, comfortable seats, and adjustable headrests. Although there were no entertainment screens, the ScootTV streamed to my computer was good.",0
2016,"Flew Scoot from Don Muang to Singapore. Didn't expect to be seated in a seat with so much leg room, beside the escape exit door. I thought you would pay a premium for this, but I was allocated this seat and didn't pay a cent for such a comfort. Now I know why people pay more. Being able to stretch your legs is really a luxury. Flight was good, even though there was turbulence. Lighting onboard was fantastic. Crew didn't push, hard sell food and other pay-per-use services. Paid for wi-fi and onboard charging of mobile devices. Scoot just won itself a new (repeat) customer.",0
2016,"Singapore to Taipei with Scoot on the SIN-TPE-NRT route. The legroom was not bad for a someone 5'5 and the recline was nice. Aircraft was spacious. Announcements were made in English, Chinese and Japanese. The flight was better the expected. I will fly again.",0
2016,"Perth to Singapore with Scoot. The plane looks very new and clean. I believe the mood lighting does help a bit. Cabin crew were friendly and ground crew were efficient and friendly as well. The flight left on time and got into Singapore early. I have taken Scoot a few times and each time it did not disappoint. In my opinion, they have the best flight time leaving Perth to get to Singapore on each day.",0
2016,Forget Scoot. They cancelled the flight three weeks before and have not refunded even after 6 mails and 3 months waiting for them paying the money back. I had to pay 100 Euro more and had some stress for searching and booking via another airline and they even do not pay me the money for the original ticket of their cancelled flight. You cannot trust them.,1
2016,"Scoot is a very good low cost airline. I would fly it over Jetstar for this route from Perth to Singapore if I am travelling on a low cost airline. The plane was new and clean. We did leave later than expected as the plane flying into Perth got delayed in Singapore. Scoot sent me an email with a bid fo Biz upgrade. I entertained the idea and I bid for it, which I won a day after. However, on the day of check in, there was a change of plane in Singapore hence the delayed flight, and they could not put me in the Biz section so I asked for a refund. After calling their call centre, I was told that I had to call back to check for updates and they do not have the provision to send email updates. Anyway, I am still waiting for my one week period for them to process this.",0
2016,"Bangkok Don Muang to Singapore evening flight. Before boarding the aircraft, we had still some time left to do shopping and a quick bite at the airport. We decided to buy a meal at the airport and took it to the plane to eat. When seated in the plane, FA came to us and told us: 'You are not allowed to bring outside food in the aircraft. You are required to stop eating until disembarkation. Please refer to the terms and conditions when you booked this flight'. I though the FA was making a joke, but she was serious and stood next to us until we put our food in our bag. Then she informed her colleague who said we were not allowed to eat. If we are hungry, we could buy their meal on board. Nasi Lemak 15S$, Chicken rice 15S$ prices are not acceptable for airplane food. FA did not provide us Singapore Arrival Form. You should go ask them. During the flight, the FA were only busy with selling drinks, snacks and onboard shopping. No attention were paid to passengers.",1
2016,"Perth to Singapore. My wife and I were most impressed with Scoot. From checking in at the airport, the staff were obliging and friendly. The seats were comfortable, plenty of legroom, food was excellent and cabin staff very polite and friendly. On the return journey, the only complaint we have is that we were seated opposite the toilet and this at times had its moments of drifting odours. We are flying again at xmas time and hope we again have a good experience.",0
2016,Sydney to Singapore with Scoot. Excellent experience and great value for money. Would highly recommend for those on a budget. For those needing extra leg room it is so much better than economy class. Staff really looked after us and it was great being first on and off the plane. No need to stand in long queues and having to jostle past other travelers.,0
2016,"Our experience flying Scoot from Melbourne to Taipei via Singapore was a miserable one. The cabin was hot, as there are no overhead airvents it just got worse as the flight went on. What makes this issue worse is they charge you a lot for water when they are running a very hot cabin. I wrote to Scoot feedback about this issue and they confirmed they run the cabin at 24c degrees. Once the sun streams in through the windows and there's no cool air in the cabin it feels a lot hotter. From this flight my mother got sick and she was unwell for the rest of our trip. I read all the negative reviews of Scoot but went into flying with them with an open mind but I couldn't ignore how uncomfortable flying with them is. Next the seats, after a few hours it feels like a metal bar is pushing into your lower back, I found them unbearable, the food wasn't much better. Because of this we changed carriers when we flew back and went Emirates, which after you add all the add ons on Scoot really wasn't much more expensive. It was like night and day - we had ventilation, the food was decent and the seats comfortable . Why do Scoot run the cabins so hot and why no ventilation. These are basic needs of human comfort. The cabin attendants were rude - one had a fair old go at my mum for eating a sandwich she bought at the airport.  Once we landed in Singapore they parked at a stand and bussed us to the terminal, considering the amount of clear gates, is this really necessary ?",1
2016,"Singapore to Guangzhou, flying with Scoot. They have good aircraft, staff, etc, but their schedule is just crazy. They cannot operate the Guangzhou flight on time even though they have a blocked flight time which is much longer than the actual flying time. Have to improve their game. Pros, a good aircraft in the Boeing 787, nice staff and good seats. The cons: bad scheduling - remote gate in Guangzhou is horrendous (other airlines get better gates). Horrible placing of light and call attendant button in the seat area, and it went off every 10 seconds in the flight.",0
2016,"First experience of Boeing 787 with Scoot on Singapore Bangkok round trip. While Scoot is low cost airline, the aircraft was brand new Boeing 787 and seats were quite comfortable. Routine flight, but one can sense that you are flying on higher altitude than usual (it was 42000ft). Okay service, no delay - was actually a good experience. Plus the aircraft is able to contact to WiFi.",0
2016,"Bangkok to Singapore, and a great experience flying with Scoot! First time I had flown with them. Plane was quite large, made you feel like you had room, and  wasn't cramped. Empty seats all around, lots of room to stretch out. Great for short trips, if you only have a carry on bag. No snacks or drinks included in flight, but it's a budget airline. Price of the tickets was well worth it. Would definitely fly with them again.",0
2016,"Third time flying with Scoot, from Sydney to Singapore. New Boeing 787-900 was clean and comfortable. I like the larger size windows and you can adjust the tinting. Crew friendly and efficient. Did not pre purchase any food but you can buy onboard. The adjustment I would like to see is perhaps complimentary water. There is no inflight entertainment so take that into consideration on the 7-8hr trip and plan ahead. Return flight was also good, but the late departure out of Singapore at 1.45am is quite tiring. Scoot CEO was on board and crew took opportunity to invite passengers to have photos taken with them and their CEO.  Overall, I like Scoot as a low cost airline and if you keep this in mind and not expect a full service airline (ie: pay as you go) you shouldn't be too disappointed.",0
2016,"Overall a very poor experience with Scoot when compared with other budget airlines. It was our first time so we did not realise the biz class seats did not recline much and the leg rest also did not come up. We bought biz cos we thought we would get a better rest on the redeye but instead, passengers in economy were able to take 2-3 seats and lie down while there is a non-movable handrest between the biz seats and my toddler couldn't lie on my lap so ended up being even more uncomfortable. I brought packet oats for my toddler and wanted just a bowl of hot water but even that could not be accommodated. I guess this is budget but I don't know what biz class I was paying for. On the return flight, we missed the cutoff for the checkin counter by 5 min, that is clearly our bad as we didn't know it was 1 hour cutoff (In Singapore mostly 40 min) but what annoyed was the scoot counter staff attitude. It's tough for anyone to miss their flights but they were really mean and rude about it. I then realised the Economy class passengers for this flight were still being checked in and asked why we couldn't then get on but she said its because we were not already in the queue by the 1 hour mark. So it wasn't like the counter had closed which I would fully understand but just for the principle of it. This inflexibility really put me off. Next she tells me too bad, the tickets are non-refundable (we paid $2700 for the 3 tickets - not exactly cheap cos i wrongly thought biz class was worth it). They had no scoot counter at the airport and there is no wifi at the airport. So I had to make multiple long-distance calls to find out tomorrow's flight would cost be another $2k. At this point, I gave up and opted to buy 3 new full-fare ticket on SIA from Brisbane airport. It was a mistake to fly Scoot. Should have just flown a return flight on SIA from the get-go. Somehow I bought being a SIA subsidiary meant I was getting a similar customer service which was not the case.",1
2016,"Melbourne to Singapore return. $5 for early check-in, changing date of flying without even proper explanation (simply an ordinary email), barely any service and delays up to 1 hour - not really for people who dislike delays, primitive service, awful communication and ridiculous extra costs. Not to mention the insincere attitude of the crew. Nevertheless their Boeing 787 seats have very good seat pitch. For small extra cost one can sit in the ""Scoot in Silence"" section which has better seats and proximity to business class (a few passengers simply went and sat there - crew didn't care). The more humid flight helped and atmospheric lighting of 787 made flying more interesting. Currently there's not many from Australia flying on Scoot, so I had 3 seats all to myself. This really enabled sleep.",0
2016,"Booked Scoot from Singapore to Perth as it had the best arrival time in Perth than any other flight on the day we needed to travel. Had read previous reviews and was honestly dreading the flight as they had been largely negative. We were pleasently surprised that the seats were roomy, staff pleasant and organised, the flight took off on time and landed on time. The inflight service was as you expect from a budget airline. It was a very good flight. It's a budget airline, we found it good value maybe we are not as precious about air travel as some. But not as bad as some of the reviews would have you believe.",0
2016,"Scoot Biz from Bangkok to Perth via Singapore. Scoot have new Boeing 787 aircraft now, thats an improvement over the old B777. Like all the discount airlines, you have to pay for everything even with Scoot Biz - but they go the extra mile with charges not just for baggage, meals, entertainment, they even charge you to be among the first to be boarded. At DMK no early check in available, no dedicated Scoot Biz check in lane, but I asked and was shown to a check in counter immediately. DMK-SIN Boeing 787 has only 3 rows of business class but the seats are bigger and have more recline than economy class, but were hard as concrete. As I had 11 hours waiting in SIN for the connection I decided to pay extra for lounge access, they call it scoot in style. They use the SATS lounge which is very old and tired lounge, uninterested staff, uncomfortable seats, very limited snacks - the only redeeming feature was a shower, so refreshing for the next flight was helpful. SIN-PER was another Boeing 787 but with 6 rows of business class, same hard seats. The only highlight of the trip was both meals (beef) were quite good, not usually expected with discount airlines. So much for priority baggage handling for their ScootBiz passengers, mine were among the last to come out. All hype, little substance, just another low cost airline pretending to be something better.",0
2016,"Economy from Sydney to Singapore and ScootBiz on the way back. Overall, the flight was cheap - you get what you pay for. Bought the fares on a sale, and even with fees with checked-in luggage, it was about half the cost of a full-service airline. The seats were fantastic - especially for a low cost airline. According to Seatguru economy seats were a generous 18""-19"" wide. This is wider than many full-service airlines. Practically speaking, this could mean a difference between being able to tuck your elbows between the seat handles (instead of clashing with your neighbour's elbow) or not. Leg room was also adequate, although I am shorter than average (5'8""). The ScootBiz seat was, obviously, much more comfortable. But note that it is a Premium Economy, rather than Business offering. It involved reclining wide seats but added utility is limited because the leg rest awkwardly stops mid-calf and cuts off your circulation after a while. The major let-downs were twofold. Firstly, the appalling attitude the ground and especially call centre staff. After talking to them I felt like they were doing me a huge favour by allowing me to fly on Scoot. I get that it's a budget airline, but it doesn't cost much (if at all) to be slightly more courteous. The second is the food. You are not allowed to bring your own food, and you need to buy theirs. Not surprisingly, food is not cheap. But unfortunately, the Nasi Lamak I got was greasy and salty. Bottom line: if you're a budget traveller, they are nevertheless solid. If you're an infrequent flyer, I'd consider spending the extra money on a full-service airline.",0
2016,"We've flown Perth-to-Singapore (economy) more than a dozen times. Pluses include price and comfort. This was our first (and probably last) business class flight with Scoot. Our son, based in Singapore, upgraded us as a gift. The sole benefit was seat size / comfort. I agree with a previous reviewer: Scoot airline attendants are confused. And who can blame them? Scoot advertises an Australian shiraz, but never, ever delivers. It really doesn't matter if you're flying Economy or Business Class, Perth-Singapore or Singapore-to-Perth, there's never, ever that advertised Wolf Blass Shiraz listed in the Food and Beverages catalogue. We really enjoy a glass of red with our evening meal. It just never happens aboard a Scoot flight. Happy to pay that S$9.00 per bottle, even in Biz Class (where it ought to be free) but no there isn't even one little 185 mL bottle of red aboard the plane. We fly abroad over four months every year. We find communication with nearly all airlines easy. Try to communicate with Scoot. It's truly a lost cause.",1
2016,"Every year, my daughter and I would travel during school holidays, this year we chose to travel to Singapore. After checking, I noticed Scoot was a couple of hundred dollars cheaper compared to another major airline. So I booked Scoot and booked only 1 luggage for me and my daughter. A day before our flight, my daughter said she might need an extra luggage so I went to the Scoot website ""Manage My Booking"" Section to purchase an extra luggage allowance. It took me half an hour to get to my booking details because the website could not find my booking reference. Finally after getting to my flight details, I added an extra 10kg on top of my luggage allowance of 20kg and paid $34. I also paid $24 to book our seat numbers. I tried to add meals in our booking but the website said meal booking was not available at that moment. Finally on the day of our departure, 15th January 2016, we went to Sydney airport and the check in guy said our luggage was over the 20kg allowance and I said I booked an extra 10kg the night before. They said there was no extra 10kg booked in our flight and that I have to pay $140 extra for the excess weight. I asked them to double check because I know I paid for it the night before. The woman said they see an extra 10kg booking for our return flight. I asked there was a mistake and if they could fix that problem and apply the extra 10kg allowance for this flight. The woman said in a firm tone there's nothing they can do, I have to pay the extra $140.  Before boarding  we bought a couple of bottled water and after take off I pulled a bottle water out of our carry bag but the flight attendant told us we are not allowed to consume any food or drinks we have with us. I said my daughter is thirsty and the flight attendant told us we have to buy water from them which cost $4 for a very small bottle of water, and we waited for at least 15 mins for the bottled water to be given us. An hour after later, the flight attendants started serving meals to those who were successful in booking their meals. I asked one of the flight attendants if I could buy food and she said we have to wait. We waited for more than half an hour before she came to take our order. I ordered a wrap and she asked me if i wanted it warmed up. I said yes, and after paying it took another 30 mins for the food to be served to us. I was observing the staff on board and I noticed they keep on asking each other and they all looked confused.",1
2016,"Singapore to Perth with Scoot, a low-cost airline but with a modern Boeing 787 fleet. Efficient check-in with dedicated ScootBiz lane and embarkation with Biz pax first on board. Seating is hardly business class, more like premium economy. Staff mostly smiling and friendly, efficient to the point of rote. For example, the meal provide in Scootbiz is very basic but reasonably tasty. However, my companion had ordered a different meal to mine. When the attendant was asked for an ice cream the same as is available on my meal, was told no, it was only a Toblerone with her meal. Do it by the book! Looking back to the main cabin there was a separate 'quiet' zone directly behind business area, no children allowed, but low and behold two very small crying children in business section! Scoot, overall, have a good LCC product which compares favourably and in many cases exceeds, service on other airlines. The only downside was the disastrous arrival in Perth, an airport designed, and operated, like one from the 1960s, with zero service standards. Just dreadful.",0
2016,"Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore, and the only reason I chose Scoot was the low airfare and I was pleasantly surprised. The plane was clean and sleek. Comfy-ish seats (I'm only 4'11 so leg room isn't an issue for me). The cabin lights were multicoloured. The staff were friendly and smiley. Perhaps because they had comfy looking black and yellow polo shirts/dresses (albeit a little Star Trek like). Not overly efficient with food/drink - they practically ran past with the trolley and if you didn't make eye contact you weren't getting anything. For the price though, and arriving in one peice; I'm taking that as a win.",0
2016,"I think Scoots service quality has declined significantly these days. Yesterday (Jan 23, 2015), I was flying with my friend from Sydney to Singapore. Our flight was delayed. However, neither the check-in desk staff nor the digital displays said anything about the delay. We realized about the delay only when we reached the boarding gate at 1:15PM and found no plane there. The flight took off at 5:51PM (Sydney Time), 4 hours after the original departure time. However, instead of Scoots promised 50 dollar voucher for 4 hour delay, the crews shook off their responsibility for the delay by offering the passengers a bottle of water and a packet of chips. Even in that case, they could not provide chips and water bottle for every passenger. In addition,  I and my friend requested the check-in staff to give us seats in the middle of the plane if possible. The check-in desk staff told us that she is giving us seats 44D/F (My friend on 44D, me on 44E and 44F is empty) and we two can use these three seats. However, when we went in, we found that another passenger is assigned to seat 44F. I really dont understand why it was necessary to lie to us. She was not obliged to give us seats according to our request.",1
2016,"As a 6 ft 3, fairly well built bloke, I regularly struggle with long haul comfort - though this doesn't really stop me from travelling on every opportunity. Scoot were competitively priced on our routes from Hong Kong to Perth and then Perth back to Singapore, so I thought I'd give them a go given their association with Singapore Airlines which bred confidence. I was genuinely amazed how much room I found myself with, seat width I didn't find an issue. On one leg we asked whether it were possible to sit at one of the pairs of seats at the rear of the plane. I highly recommend these. There was plenty of space to the side of the window seat to place books etc. I found the staff pleasant and flights were punctual. I can't comment on the food as I didn't try it but the on-board Wi-Fi was very impressive. Reasonably priced (about 8 for 3 hours if I remember correctly) which kept me entertained. Only negative was the placement of the lighting/attendant buttons on the armrests. Proper design issue there I think. The lack of entertainment was expected so I can't complain but it's probably the only factor that differentiates it negatively from a full service carrier. Overall it was probably the best set of flights I've taken in Economy and put the British Airways 787 offering on the KUL-LHR leg to absolute shame - despite being a budget carrier!",0
2016,"Our Scoot flight from Perth to Singapore was passable, but the return pretty horrendous and one of the worst flights I've ever been on! Ground staff in Singapore were great and check in very smooth but it was all downhill from there. Boeing 787's are considered to be fairly new but this fleet is looking very worn and the plane was not terribly clean either. Legroom is good (by budget standards) but armrests are tiny and we were repeatedly clicking the overhead light on by accident. Could not decipher many of the announcements due to the poor English and very heavy accents of the attendants. Flight was very turbulent for most of the journey too which didn't help.  If you must travel Scoot, get a seat in the 'quiet zone', or towards the front of the aircraft - even if you have to pay extra. Also, you can bid on business seats and 'win' an upgrade for as little as $100 from what I have heard.",1
2016,"Melbourne to Singapore with Scoot. Check in was ok, but passengers were made to wait inside the airbridge for almost 10 minutes. The new Boeing 787 aircraft had a layer of black dust on its ventilation slots above passengers' heads. A stewardess told me that they try to turn around the aircraft so fast that there is no time for proper cleaning. The toilet sink was also blocked for most of the flight. Premium selection meal was okay, but very small. The only solace was the real cheap fare that I paid for the flight.",1
2016,"Tokyo Narita to Taipei with Scoot. Quick check in. Clean cabin and comfortable seats. On time departure. Premier meal was good. Scoot TV was a hassle to get working. Didn't work on OS9, worked on Samsung tablet. Only 1 free movie per biz seat. Would fly again as was good value.",0
2016,"Melbourne to Singapore. We booked the seats with extra leg space and even then the seats were very narrow and the arm rest could not be lifted so the hip space was very small. The service of the air steward and stewardesses was awful as well. My parents are Indians and thus when they speak English, they have a thick Indian accent and they tend to speak slowly. However, instead of listening to what they were saying patiently, a stewardess just rolled her eyes which was rude. My family and I are vegetarians so we had bought some food in the airport to eat in the plane. We have done this before during traveling. However, the steward told us outside food was not allowed and so we told them this time we had already brought the food and we wouldn't do it next time while traveling. However, a steward kept glaring at us each time he walked past. I have never seen service where the flight attendants are so rude.",1
2015,"Flew Scoot from Tokyo to Singapore via Taoyuan. Seat and legroom: Spacious but configuration of 2-3-2 didn't make it feel like Business class. Food: One complimentary meal, one complimentary drink (not free flow). Food portions were very small and even to me as a small eater, it didn't fill me. Taste of food was acceptable. I had the braised chicken rice. Delay: Plane was found faulty at Taoyuan and we were delayed for more than 3 hours, stuck in Taoyuan International. Couldn't take off. They didn't let us off the plane as well for the first hour and it felt claustrophobic. When we went back 3 hours later, it was still the same plane. It took them another half an hour more before we got ready to leave. No compensation of any sort, just an apology which I found unacceptable.",1
2015,"Wanting to fly 787 was the main motivation to travel with Scoot. Travelled Hong Kong to Sydney with a 30 hour break in Singapore. Flew BIZ which had good seats and leg room. This is a low cost done well with a clear focus on what I find important in a trip. No frills but at a very competitive prize. Check in and boarding was efficient. Food onboard was okay, but did not bother with the inflight entertainment; read a book. Cabin crew well trained and not as busy as legacy carriers. Plane was new and better than than most. At the prices they charge this is an excellent package.",0
2015,"Singapore to Perth with Scoot on 15th November was one of the best flights I have done. Plane and seats were great, staff were great, meal was good. Would not hesitate to fly with them again - the only issue I had was not understanding the wifi, that was my fault. Scoot is a good budget airline.",0
2015,"For a recent business trip, I found Scoot which offered some great Business Class rates for locations that I travel to regularly and decided to give them a try. Because of route limitations (Narita to Hong Kong), I had to piece my flight together by purchasing each leg individually. While purchasing my flights, I found that even though the basic airfares offered are the same as those sold on other travel websites, it is not obvious until you have completed your initial order that everything else is ""a la carte"" with regards to cost. Since I fly Singapore Air regularly, it was nice that an option to count my Scoot flight on my Kris Flyer account, it was ridiculous that I have to pay extra for this feature ($20-$30 extra). But there are a number of things that Scoot's website either fails to disclose, is not well worded or has hidden on some obscure page on their site requiring hours of searching. One items it that their online check in is only available for flights DEPARTING from Singapore. Additionally, I suggest making sure to double and triple check your travel dates and times since their website did not provide me with a flight on the date and time of day that I had requested (requested Fri evening, was giving FRI AM past midnight schedule instead of making it Sat AM past midnight). For the HK to Singapore leg, I found that Scoot offered a nice comfortable ride, fast boarding (Business Class) and fairly good service from the flight crew. Scoot is definitely an all economy airline since additional beverages beyond what was included with the meal were offered even for purchase. Speaking of the meal, unless you like eating what is similar to cheap frozen microwave meals, I suggest as others have mentioned to bring your own food along. Also the flight crew do not remove the plastic cover before serving you so make sure to drape your napkin across your clothes to avoid splattering yourself. At least the flight crew were nice and friendly and were dressed like flight crew's from the 50's and 60's which was a nice change from the stuffy or garish looking uniforms that other airlines use. As for my Singapore to Narita flight, this is when I learned that Scoot's website made an error with my flight request. Like I noted previously, I had requested for a flight on Friday afternoon or evening specifically and did not realize that it had offered me a flight just past midnight on Thursday evening instead of Saturday. So this is where things got really interesting. First, based on the way the website was worded when I attempting to login and make a flight change 2 days before hand that the site said I could not make any changes until 24 hours before my scheduled flight. So I waited and tried to make the change 24 hours before my flight but was still not allowed to do so. Well like any other traveler, I decided to just call and have the change made over the phone - only to my surprise to learn that I was marked a ""No Show"" because the flight I had paid for had already boarded and was about to depart. Unlike other airlines, the Scoot rep rudely told me that the error was my fault and that their policy was to not refund the cost of the flight especially since I was now marked as a ""No Show"" and became argumentative, so Customer Service is definitely not a strong feature for Scoot.",1
2015,"Flew Scoot and purchased the FlyBagEat. Comfort wise was actually good even for economy. Food for Melbourne to Singapore leg was passable although the servings was small compared to normal economy food, not enough to last the 7 hours flight. Very bad food for the return leg Singapore to Melbourne. Breakfast was scrambled eggs set or croissants with ham and cheese. The eggs was a huge disappointment and the hash brown was mushy. The croisant was cold. Scoot should be penalised for serving this kind of food. Asked about the scrambled eggs, a staff responded there had been complaints. Will still fly Scoot and bring my own food.",0
2015,"This is maybe the 8th time I've flown Scoot, and the 7th for Scootbiz - I'm writing this review on the way to Singapore. The subject line should be ""They Could Do So Much Better"". Great new airline, friendly staff, good quality seating, but their systems are completely outdated. If you are going to offer wifi and scootTV, then do the basics and make sure they work. The wifi logins with partners don't work, so even if you have a valid account, you still have to pay each time you board. And ScootTV, just deplorable, really bad. If you're just interested in the seat leg and arm room, they're great. If you want to actually watch something, forget it. Do not exceed your baggage limitation as they will screw you at $21/kg.",1
2015,"I bought a ScootBiz ticket, curious to see exactly what you get and if it was worthwhile. Starting with the booking process, you get the promise of a big seat (not a lay-flat such as AirAsia), free seat allocation, 20 or 30kg of luggage and a premium meal. The meal was terrible - probably the worst airline food I've had. Starting a bit early at Changi airport - we were told bluntly that early check-in would be additional cost - even for Scoot Biz.  Neither is internet and depending on what you read - even the streaming entertainment. Once onboard, I found the extra-large seat to be hard as a rock and only reclined a bit - not enough for a comfortable sleep. Yes, it was better than economy seating, but not much. And after 5 hours of flying, a request for a 100ml cup of water was denied - the Scootie insisting that I had to pay for drinks. The staff seem inexperienced, but even worse not having a very good time. It feels like you pay for virtually everything, even in ScootBiz.",1
2015,"Flew Scoot from Bangkok Don Mueang to Singapore on a new Boeing 787. Upgraded on the bid app online to business class for only 30. Boarding was very quick and organised and the flight pushed back ahead of schedule. Seat was very comfortable and offered good pitch. Crews very friendly and also lots of information from the flight crew as well. Food was not good but for 70 total price for a 2.5 hour flight in business class it was an absolute steal, so I can't complain. Will be flying this route a lot in the next few months and will be using Scoot instead of Air Asia or Jetstar.",0
2015,"Flew on ScootBiz for a short hop from Kaohsiung to Osaka. A new Boeing 787 with decent seat, great leg room and attentive service. I'm more than happy to trade off onboard entertainment, mediocre food one would expect in economy class on a full fare airline for the better seat (think old school regional business class seat) on a new plane. Okay, the food was pretty poor, but I'm not sure what some of other users were expecting of the ScootBiz seat/experience. The fare I paid was comparable to China Airlines Economy fare for this leg. I know for example that Sydney-Singapore on ScootBiz can be cheaper than Economy on SIA.",0
2015,"Clean, big and spacious, I love this aircraft! Normally for short-haul flights, budget airlines would use smaller airplanes with 3-3 seat arrangement. However, for this trip from Hong Kong to Singapore, we managed to sit in Scoot's Boeing 787 with the 2-3-2 seat arrangement. It was very spacious and clean. Staff were friendly. Seat was very comfortable, I slept during my 3 hours journey. No delay, no lost baggage which are good news. And like other budget flights, there were no meals or inflight entertainment. However, these could be purchased on board. Would highly recommend Scoot for short haul flights for price, service and comfort.",0
2015,"Hong Kong to Perth via Singapore with Scoot. Was very pleased with the handling of the situation when we missed our flight to Perth after a six hour delay in Hong Kong. Meal vouchers were given and was adequate if eating at the local food hall. As always was wise to take out insurance to cover just this sort of situation as we had to stay a couple of extra nights in Singapore. Would have been nice if we could have had some sort of corporate discount with accommodation. In Singapore Airport getting our bags was another issue. Was delayed for a time and could not find our bags till we started filling a lost and claim form it turned up. All in all an experience, but love Singapore so was not fuzzed by having to stay a couple of extra nights. Happy with the premium economy upgrade on our trip back to Perth.",0
2015,"Give Scoot the Boot - travelled on flight TZ2 - Singapore to Sydney, night flight. The seating layout is not Business Class - more like a bad Premium Economy on any other airline. No leg room when seat in front is pushed back. No blanket, no pillow (this was a night flight). Flight crew had no smiles or personality and barely spoke English. It was a quick flight due to the new Boeing 787 - just 7 hours all up - thank goodness as we could not wait to get off the plane and stretch our legs. Even though the Food was pre-ordered on booking, nothing was served until 3 hours out of Sydney. If you wanted food before then, you had to pay extra for it - drinks too. When food did appear it was terrible quality. The coffee was instant, with powered milk in a polystyrene cup! and last but not least - NO Inflight Entertainment or WIFI connectivity !! Yes - Scoot is the budget arm of Singapore Airlines but, how budget does 'budget Scoot business class' have to get.",1
2015,"2 hours before the flight from Kaohsiung to Singapore, Scoot sent an email saying the flight was delayed until at least the next day and the plane was grounded. They gave no compensation for overnight stay and would only refund the amount of the flight as a Scoot voucher and also would not refund the extras purchased such as business upgrade and checked in baggage.",1
2015,"Seoul Incheon to Singapore via Taipei. Scoot flight was fairly uncomfortable for me both to and fro. The seats were stiff and uncomfortable, there were no meals provided for 8 hour flights, they had to be purchased separately. The flight back from Korea was delayed for 2 hours, everyone who had to detour in Taipei was stuck for 2 hours and this was in the midnight 1-3am. I felt very sorry for a little girl who was extremely tired but since we arrived late from the Korea flight there were no seats left at the waiting area in Taipei so she had to sleep on the ground with her bag under her head. Both times I boarded the flight, both arrived late. No compensation was offered and the pilot claimed it was due to Taipei's runway being closed. Personally, I did not feel that the announcement sounded apologetic, it seemed more like an excuse to me. Afterall, the flight was already an hour late upon arrival in Taipei so clearly whatever the runway issues were the late arrival had nothing to do with it. A more comprehensive view of all the problems with my trip with Scoot. It was booked by my company therefore I was not given the choice to pick. When I checked the itinerary the first thing that alerted me was no 25kg check-in baggage. My boss' secretary booked it and when I asked she mentioned she did not know it was not provided because she assumed that all international flights would include it. Therefore, we had to pay for the baggage which eventually summed up to cost even more than Vietnam Airlines which already included the baggage fees (I did a price comparison on my own). I was sent on a two week business trip which required me to ship a laboratory equipment back. Another problem cropped up when I was supposed to ship the parcel back. I was paged by one of the airline personnel to the boarding gate. She informed me that the parcel has been detained because it does not fit the airline regulations. Firstly, like all the other normal, regular people, I do not read all the airline regulations although I have a rough understanding of what is allowed and what isn't. This knowledge obviously does not comprise of laboratory equipment and other aspects which are uncommon to be brought on board - if there was a problem they should have alerted me during the check-in of my bag, not when I am about to board a plane. The staff then told me I have to leave the equipment behind. She was pretty rude, trying to shove her piece of airline regulation in my face telling me that the specifications for the equipment exceeds those of the airline regulations. I am not Korean and the manufacturer's description were in Korean. I told her to open it and read it herself and I have no problem with that. She told me they already did and I just cannot check this in. She did not give me any solutions to my dilemma. What I got from her was basically, ""Miss, the airline does not allow us to take this on board, so please just dump it here and get on your flight."" I was obviously very annoyed by this as I had paid for the excess baggage. So I told her if the baggage is now left behind, I should at least be refunded for my baggage fees. She gave me a downright no. There was no effort being put into trying to make the customer happy. She didn't even offer to ask. All in all, no more Scoot for me.",1
2015,"I was surprised by the leg room on budget airline Scoot. It is almost as good as the full service airlines. The plane is new and the seat comfortable. Apart from the lack of a TV screen on the seat back and food service, it almost feel like a full service airline. I did pre-order a beef casserole and it was delicious.",0
2015,I took the Scott fight from Kaohsiung to Singapore on 15 Oct 2015. This was my second time flying with Scoot. The first time was earlier this year on the SIN-TPE-SIN route. The plane departed on schedule and arrived about 3/4 hour ahead of schedule. Both the ground and air crew were generally polite and friendly. Definitely a more positive experience compared to my previous experience flying with Scoot.,0
2015,"I have flown Scoot 20+ times, initially because of price, but then because of aircraft. However, the more you fly them, the more reasons you have to avoid them. It's not the little things like the cabin call buttons positioned so you cannot avoid pressing them by mistake. It's not the inedible food. No, it's the staff. I flew Scoot within a month of their first flight and they were genuinely trying. Now, they have all become SIA wannabes, following the rules with slavish zeal. I don't mind when there is at least the intention to improve my safety. I got used to being told to put my seat upright when still at 40,000ft, etc. And it is just amusing that none of the staff can pronounce ""Let's get outta here"", without it sounding like ""customers go away"". But yesterday, I arrived at DMK airport in Bangkok 56 mins before the departure time to be told, along with a bunch of other disappointed customers, that the check in desk was already closed. No amount of pleading would get the man with the walkie talkie to waver from the script, despite there being plenty of time to clear through. With Bangkok's traffic, I can imagine this is going to happen quite often. This cost me two additional airport taxis, a night in a hotel and a new one-way ticket (with another airline). If I or my luggage don't make a plane, that is my fault, but this case is pure pointless pedantry. I'm sorry Scoot, after using you since the beginning, you have gone too far. I will not be using you again.",1
2015,"We flew to Singapore with Scoot in April this year and were quite happy with the service, comfort and even the food! It's a budget airline and good value. I booked online through Scoot's own website and all prices were quoted in AUD. When we wanted to go to Singapore again next year, I didn't hesitate to book with Scoot once again. Their website now quotes prices in Singapore dollars and the booking process continues in this currency. There now appears to be a myriad of extra charges and fees, which are not quoted on the initial page and were not paid on our previous trip but still cheaper than other airlines. When it comes to paying - beware if you are paying in a currency other than Singapore dollars because the conversion is not calculated properly and is majorly in Scoot's favour. I was charged $42 more than the official conversion rate and when I called Scoot to complain, they didn't want to know! I am now so disappointed in Scoot that I will not be using them again.",1
2015,"Scott from Sydney to Singapore. Boarding was slow and not helped by two passengers who failed to board, but despite this departure was only eight minutes late. I had an aisle seat with a couple next to me in the window and middle seat, so I soon transferred to an empty middle block of three. The seats are narrow - about 43-45cm but having three allowed me to snooze quite comfortably and better than in what is euphemistically called 'business class' with minimal recline and those horrible large non retractable armrests. Why would anyone waste an extra A$200 plus one way for less comfort? Staff were friendly but the design of the light and call buttons (and 'cancel call' button) in the armrest meant they frequently went to seats where passengers had mistakenly pressed it. Which designer thought of this? The meals are horribly expensive and a small icecream (we'd call it a 'buddy' in Australia) was an extortionate A$6. I brought my own water filled at Sydney Airport after passenger screening: a small Evian bottle on board was an outrageous A$4 with no free tap water available. There was an inadequate number of toilets on board (five for about 295 seats in economy class, although there were a total of slightly less than 300 on board including in so-called ScootBiz.) The F and B prices are way above Cebu Pacific. . There is no entertainment on board except for self service. That attracts a charge. We arrived Singapore about three minutes late.",1
2015,"The Boeing 787 was comfortable and clean. Legroom is pretty good for a budget airline. Plane left on time from Perth and return flight from Singapore was about 20 minutes late only due to busy time of day at Changi. Staff were professional and pleasant on both flights. Food is hit and miss depending on what you order. If you want to have a meal it is best to pre-order as the food service is a bit slow, plus they serve all the pre-order meals first. There was no entertainment, (an app like Virgin Australia would be good), so bring your iPad or a good book. $12 USD / hour for wifi service is a bit steep. Have to agree about the service / light button on the armrest, I kept turning it on by accident. The dimmer button for the windows is a great feature. Also refill your empty water bottle in the Changi boarding lounge for the return flight. Overall no worse than other budget airlines, I would fly Scoot again.",0
2015,"I booked my first flight ever with Scoot through their app. My flight was from Bangkok to Perth with a layover in Singapore. I did not realize that you had to set preferences for both legs of the flight. I booked 40 kg of luggage, as I was making a move. But apparently, it only booked for Bangkok to Singapore. Why wouldn't I be taking the same amount of luggage for the following flight if that is my final destination? I've never had to book preferences for each leg of a flight. Not to mention when it comes to seating, if you just 'continue' it will automatically pick a seat for you and charge you, you have make sure to uncheck the box if you don't want that absurd charge (that I actually caught on to). Anyway, on the app if you have a layover you have to slide the screen over to set your preferences for the following flights, which I didnt realize, because like I said before I've never had to do that. They could make the app more user friendly by actually guiding you through each flight instead of trying to trick you and making you pay more in the end because you had to book extra luggage after the inital booking. Also, when I called customer service the lady was extremely rude, she kept talking over me while I was trying to explain what happened.",1
2015,"For my first flight with Scoot I decided to stick with a standard seat, and it was pretty decent, certainly more comfortable than most full service airlines. The brand new 787 aircraft was bright and clean, and the flight departed on time and arrived a few minutes early. Inflight wifi was said to be available - but at USD12 for 1 hour I didn't verify. Food was a let-down though - they promote that vegetarian meals are available, but on this flight they were not - not a single hot vegetarian meal available for purchase (unless you could mushroom pot noodles, which I don't). In fact despite a generous menu, only 2 hot meal choices were actually available. I could understand this if the aircraft was on its return leg, but we departed their home port of Singapore for goodness sake.",0
2015,"I had not heard good reviews of Scoot, I was advised that Scoot Biz was more like Premium Economy. My husband and I could not find fault with the flight, we had a meal included and a drink (Singapore sling), which was ok as far as airline food went. If you wanted anything else you paid for it, but that's ok, I knew when I booked. The seats where very comfortable with plenty of room, our 8 hr overnight flight was great, the crew worked very hard, serving the other passengers. Will fly with Scoot again.",0
2015,"It was the our first time travelling on Scoot from Perth to Singapore and return. I had paid extra to select our seats. It was at the boarding gate just before I went to board that I noticed that our boarding tickets had a different seat number to that which I had selected on my original booking. At no time did anyone from Scoot inform me that my original seat selection had been changed. I have personal reasons for wanting to select the seats that I selected (close to the front of the plane, but given seats at the rear of the plane), so was happy to pay extra for this, otherwise I would have not bothered to select the seat option for the booking. Also the flight was delayed by 2 hours. Return fight no better. Boarded plane and was seated only to be told to get off due to plane mechanical issue and wait more than 3 hours for a replacement plane. We have flown with many other budget airlines and never had problems. Based on our experience I cannot recommend Scoot Airlines.",1
2015,"I was flying to Singapore from the Gold Coast. My friend and I had some food with us. My friend is vegan, and there was nothing for her on their menu.  A stewardess came up to us after boarding and said that we were not allowed to consume our own food on board, we needed to buy food from them. After a 10-minute discussion she said she would make an exception for us and allow us to eat our food. She also said that it was her job to make us follow such rules. If you want to watch a movie they bring you something like an iPad. They do not have USB sockets to recharge your phone either. What they do have are the staff call buttons and light buttons located where you put your arms, so that you cannot prevent from hitting these buttons unintentionally while sleeping or sitting. As for the food, I had to order some food on the way back. I ordered Beef Casserole for $11. The taste and quality was mediocre.",1
2015,"DMK-SIN was flown using an old B777 aircraft even though SCOOT website listed it as a B787 flight at time of ticket purchase. While the B787 would have been a newer and more comfortable aircraft, I did not mind the equipment change for this short sector. However, the aircraft air-conditioning malfunctioned just before push-back making the cabin hot and stuffy. Despite this, passengers were not allowed to disembark the aircraft while the fault was being fixed. Cabin crew seemed disinterested and appeared disgruntled. It was only after several complaints from passengers did the cabin crew allow passengers onto the jetway. For this, no announcements were made for obvious reasons - the jetway soon became crowded. 6 airport security personnel were brought in. Cups of water were handed out to make the delay more bearable. The aircraft departed about 90 mins late. To add insult to injury, baggage was delayed in Singapore by 2 hours due to lightning risk. No representative from SCOOT was present to provide assistance or updates. Passengers had to wait clueless of how long the delay was going to last. This despite SCOOT extremely steep baggage fees. SCOOT's basement fares translate into rock-bottom service, which can make the experience extremely painful if things don't go as planned.",1
2015,"Delayed 2 hours leaving Sydney due to late inbound arrival, I was able to use my American Express card for Lounge Access which helped. Aircraft 2 months old so very clean. Scootbiz was acceptable for 8 hour flight. The food was ok (upgraded to premium meal). Cabin staff worked hard and were friendly. Would fly Scootbiz again.",0
2015,Flew NKG-SIN-MLE-SIN-NKG. The airline has good seats compared to other airline. They currently don't have inflight entertainment so you can only read their magazine or do something on your phone to entertain yourself. I didn't purchase food nor drinks but the food and drinks seems expensive even by airport standards. On the way back to Nanjing the flight was delayed for 12 hours due to bad weather. They gave food vouchers for use in Changi Airport. The flights from SIN-MLE-SIN were operated by Tigerair.,0
2015,"Scoot Biz is not business class that's what I learned on the flight to Hong Kong but why? 1) Seats in Scoot Biz are nothing more than cheap Premium Economy seats made out of synthetic leather and plastic. The adjustment of backrest and footrest is very sluggish. 2) Food on my Scoot flight was inadequate, it was like a 1$ meal from Walmart. 3) You don't get pillows and blankets (you buy it). 4) You have no IFE in the whole plane, but the WIFI is very cheap.",1
2015,"First time flying with Scoot's Boeing 787-800. I was surprised that the seat offers good seat pitch and recline even when compared to existing full service airline seats on the Boeing 787. The the light and cabin crew call buttons are a design flaw that Scoot have yet to rectify. Apart from that, flight arrived 15 minutes earlier and the cabin crew were professional and friendly. No doubt that Scoot offers very competitive airfares on this route and the overall experience was positive for an LCC.",0
2015,"Scoot seems cheaper, but with all the inconveniences and add ons, it is actually close to the price of a full service airline. If you pay for a meal, it is atrocious even by airline standards. Basic things like check in from the city of origin to destination if you need a transfer in SIN are not included - there is a fee (marketed as Scoot-Thru) if you do not want to go through customs. I took two trips with them (one Business  read premium economy) and one economy, and have had surprises on both. The latest was not being able to check in online from Hong Kong. Atrociously inconvenient and indicative of shoddy service. Definitely an airline to be avoided.",1
2015,"Having flown Business Class on International routes with other airlines, we thought that Scoot Biz may be good value for money. Bear in mind we assumed Biz was short for Business. Instead of Business Class it was Business Farce. We had to pay extra to use the lounge and were told at the check-in desk to go to Singapore Airlines Business lounge - not so! Singapore Airlines wouldn't even admit Scoot Biz passengers, but instead referred us to another lower market lounge. The seats only reclined 8 inches and the leg support did nothing. I asked for 2 pillows to support my back and was told I had to pay for them. That was when the staff told me that it was not Business Class but Premium Economy. The meal supplied was the same as you get on any Economy Class flight with other airlines. Only one drink supplied for the 7 hour flight.  The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" rings true with Scoot Airlines.",1
2015,"We travelled Biz class from Sydney to Singapore then the next day to Bangkok. The schedule suited us exactly as it allowed us overnight in Singapore to catch up with friends. The flight left on time but due to strong head winds we arrived in Singapore a little bit late.  Biz class is good value especially if you buy on promo and we were glad to have  the extra leg room for that 8 hour flight. We booked aisle seats in the middle, so got an empty seat between us. Plenty of room to move about. We had the upgraded meals That was worth the extra compared to the normal meals we saw served. Scoot offers a free drink of your choice as part of the meal. Water was available free any time. We took our snacks onboard and there wasn't a mention from any staff about that. Then again, the snacks made no mess. We used Scoot in style at Singapore airport. Incidentally we used Krisflyer points to get a Scoot voucher and used the voucher to pay the  Scoot in Style upgrade after making our booking. You need to do all that on the website beforehand. It worked perfectly. So we arrived at check-in 3 hours ahead of the Bangkok flight and got about 2 full hours in the SATS lounge. It was worth it as you can eat and drink a lot during 2 hours! The Bangkok flight was pretty full as it was a public holiday, but Biz class was ok. Again we were offered any drink to go with our upgraded meal.  We got a seat between us empty. It was a good quality experience, I'd do it again any time. Behind us was the quiet cabin with no children. That looked good too.",0
2015,I flew on a return trip SIN-HKG on a Boeing 787 economy class. The worst part about Scoot is booking on its website. It automatically selects add-ons so you need to stay vigilant when booking your flight. The flights both were ordinary and the 787 cabin was comfortable. I flew on a flash sale fare without any add-ons or checked luggage making my flights worth the money. Passengers with checked luggage and those who need to reserve seats for family members may find better fares on other airlines.,0
2015,My Daughter and I flew Singapore to Perth 3 weeks ago. My Daughters baggage was over by 5 kgs so the check-in lady allowed her to remove heavy items and take on board as hand luggage which was great. Knowing that there was no entertainment we had a book and magazines to read and had a snooze. We bought subway at the airport and took it on board to eat. The flight attendant told us it was not allowed but to quickly eat it - which we did. We had no issues with the seats the flight was early arriving into Perth which we were pleased about. All in all a great flight which we could not fault and would definitely fly Scoot again for a cheap flight of $192.00 each.,0
2015,I was on the very first flight out of the Gold Coast to Singapore and felt compelled to write this review. Originally it was a great service with great customer service but all seems to have changed. The seats are uncomfortable the staff are unhelpful and the overhead light and crew call button is on the seat arm and keeps coming on due to just resting your arm on the arm rest. It is cold on all flights I have been on probably to get the passengers to buy Scoot blankets. My daughter recently flew to Singapore and her credit card didn't work for some strange reason. She only had a Travelex card and no cash which meant she was unable to purchase any food or drink. This is not a major problem but just inconvenient. What was deeply concerning was that the crew refused to let her have a glass of water for the whole 7+ hours! I have found the food to be unhealthy and average considering they are not charging insignificant amounts for any of it. Another word of advice is never change your flight unless you have to! They basically charge you almost the same again to change dates. It feels very much as though they have come up with a great concept and then decided to take advantage of any need such as food water warmth and entertainment and charge for it whilst providing the bare minimum of comfort. Like most airlines they even charge you a processing fee for the convenience of paying them. There is no other way to pay so they are guaranteed income from this. Then they have the add on's such as car hotel insurance and so it goes on! Overall an airline that has a great route from the Gold Coast to Singapore seems to have unfortunately turned into an uncomfortable and unreasonable airline. I will use the service in future due to convenience but not look forward to it as I have in the past! Incidentally I would have given them high scores on all aspect in the beginning except for perhaps the food. It may be better to just get the train to Brisbane and fly out from there in future.,1
2015,"TZ6 Singapore - Gold Coast on 777. Seats were hard felt very comfortable mid-way through the flight even though I have short legs. The reading lights kept coming on as we ""hit"" the light buttons located on the side of the arm- rest as we turned to relief body stiffness due to the discomfort of the seat. We sat 3 in a row and ordered the premium meal. I noticed mine was the biggest portion of 3. One of the portions was noticeably lesser probably about 85% of mine. There was a water point providing basic drinking water or you had the option to purchase bottled water. This is our first time flying with Scoot. Other than the uncomfortable seat overall it was OK for me and I will probably fly Scoot again. Looking forward to my return flight TZ5 on the Dreamliner. TZ5 Gold Coast - Singapore. Dreamliner seat was so much more comfortable. The soft and creative lighting makes it very pleasant. The windows shades also helps to create a soothing ambience. I like the sensor toilet flush wash basin tap and auto water drain - so much more convenient. It is sad that with such an updated and modern plane there was no drinking water point provided and basic drinking water had to be purchased. The reading light is now located on top of the arm rest and it keeps coming on as we rest our arms on the handle. Our pre-booked premium meal on this return trip was served without the Haagen Dazs ice cream. After we asked about the missing ice-cream we were given a bar of Toblerone chocolate and were informed that our meals come with Toblerone instead of Haagen Dazs. Naturally we were disappointed that we did not get what we have paid for. Will I travel with Scoot again? Yes so long as I do not need to buy basic drinking water on board and I get my meals purchased. If Scoot cannot deliver the meals purchased online they need to reconsider their model of not allowing outside food and drinks on board. There was a meal change after I booked my ticket and meal. I don't take beef. Luckily the change did not put beef on the table for me. Otherwise I will stay hungry despite having booked my meals.",0
2015,TZ2-TZ1 (SYD-SIN). My previous experience with their 777s were not so great especially the seats which were as hard as rock. However they have changed to the new 787 Dreamliner since then and I had a much better experience this time. Food was below average the portion still wasn't able to fill my hungry stomach. However the seats on the 787 had much better cushion and more legroom. I realized that you don't need an IFE if you are willing to pay US$30 to surf the Internet for the entire trip and a bit extra for power if you are running out of battery (though I didn't see anyone paying that in economy). The only reason IFE still exists is when you don't have access to Internet or your phone. If you don't really care about travel prestige not having hot towels and complimentary toiletries is fine willing to eat before you board and is trendy enough to substitute IFE for Internet access then you can get a really good deal out of this airline which consistently offers half the ticket price of legacy airlines over long-haul routes.,0
2015,Scoot is now flying the 787 Dreamliner from Sydney to Changi on TZ1. We have come across reviews saying a potable water tap is available in the galley. This is no longer the case. The only drinking water available on the flight is purchased bottled water at 4SGD / 330ml even if you have your own container. Be aware that row 42 has no window at all. Bearing in mind Scoot is a LCC the overall experience was excellent (for the price).,0
2015,Flew Scoot biz Perth to Singapore return. Brilliant. Great seats. Excellent service. Left on time and arrived early. Take your own entertainment. Food basic but good. Remember what you paid and appreciate the amazing value for money. Will definitely use Scoot Biz again. I suspect the Biz part is important. Don't know about economy but Biz seats were huge and comfortable and worth every cent.,0
2015,Flew SIN-TPE-SIN. Both flights used old B777s. Everything was okay except for the web check-in which they don't have. Oh they have but you have to pay for this very basic/necessary service.,0
2015,I flew from Incheon to Taipei. The plane was on time and the service was fine for a low cost airline. I found the food and drinks to be rather expensive. $8 for a small can of beer! The worst thing about the flight was the old 777 plane. For some reason they revved up the left engine to full blast when the plane was parked and then throughout the flight that engine's rev level was continually and dramatically going up and down. Perhaps it was okay but it certainly didn't sound okay. It will be good when these old planes are replaced with the 787s.,0
2015,"My husband and I had were booked on flight TZ6 which was to depart from Singapore to Coolangatta airport at 22.25pm 5/4/2015! Because my husband is in a motorised wheelchair we arrived early and paid $5pp for an early check in to avoid any hassles. The staff member at check in was extremely helpful and changed our seating from 42 H & J to 23 B & C to be closer to the exit and toilets. On our arrival to the departure lounge we were approached by an employee with a manual wheelchair and he told my husband to get in it! We explained several times to him that the wheelchair was unsuitable and that a smaller chair was necessary to get him on the plane. We finally got on board the plane and they took the small wheelchair off the plane! I asked ""How will my husband get to the toilet if there's no wheelchair on board the plane?"". The fellow from the departure gate got into an argument with the stewardess and we understood that he was telling her that she and the other stewardesses would have to carry him to the toilet which was approximately 20ft (6metres) away! My husband told the fellow that he was too heavy for them to carry him! Eventually other male passengers agreed to carry him. A few minutes later the staff member demanded I disconnect the battery on the wheelchair! I told him several times that it was disconnected. By this time both my husband and I and were getting very upset. A few minutes later the departure lounge man came back and said ""Good news the wheelchair is on board because it's a dry cell battery"". He had kept the plane from departing for almost an hour we finally flew out at 23.10pm! Because of him  this experience has made us realise that although the stewardesses were extremely polite and helpful Scoot is not worth travelling on!",1
2015,March 2015 Gold Coast to Singapore to Taipei and return with stopover. Be prepared and read the fine print as if you don't expect anything other than what they say you won't be disappointed! The flight was very cheap and absolutely no frills - no pillows blankets tea or coffee included. They are clear about this on their website any extras have to be paid for. Do not expect staff to be there to look after you although I found them all to be pleasant and polite. The food did not look to be worth buying we took sweets and small snacks for the kids and were not questioned on this although customers in front of me were asked to put their own food away. There was a free drinking water dispenser near the toilets on all the planes we travelled on but you had to go and get this yourself in your own bottle or cup. The seats were reasonable (except for the dreadful position of the call button). They like to board the planes really early so be prepared for that. We left on time each flight with one major upset with one flight where 2 hours from Singapore to Taipei we had to turn back to Singapore due to a medical issue with a passenger on board. I was surprised we did not even get a free cup of tea after what was ultimately a 5 hour delay - beyond their control admittedly but some recognition of the inconvenience would have been appropriate. Another delay due to weather when leaving Taipei was affecting all aircraft so once again frustrating but not their fault. No problems with baggage at all and although a very slow check in at Gold Coast Changi and Taoyuan check ins were a breeze. Did saving around $4000 in fares for a family of 5 make up for the inconveniences of the flight? Absolutely! Be prepared for the flight and you can splurge a lot more on the important stuff - the actual holiday!,0
2015,SYD-SIN return. I have only flown once with Scoot and had no real problems. The boarding at both ends was highly efficient and there were no outstanding delays. The 'love seats' were reasonably comfortable with enough leg room. It appears however that I may well have been very lucky. The value for money is excellent but if you can afford it then certainly fly with a full service carrier. Once you pay Scoot for all the add ons the price difference is not really that great. I myself have booked to fly with them again but if I had the money I would not. At the same time I would not consider SIA as Scoot is their offspring.,0
2015,Travelled from Singapore to Gold Coast in Scootbiz and was disappointed that the inflight entertainment was down. Cabin crew said since we have paid for it we can call Scoot when back home and asked for refund. The food was horrible I ordered chicken in dark sauce with rice but the rice was so soft like glutinous rice and was very salty. On the flight back from Gold Coast to Singapore yesterday there was inflight entertainment but was after several attempts to log in and with friendly cabin crew's help. I thought it was free for Scootbiz passengers but I was actually charged SGD16 for it! The cabin crews on board were very unprofessional. When we landed at Singapore Changi Airport when waiting for baggage claims the group of Scoot cabin crews and captains were making lots of noise standing together with the passengers a rather unprofessional sight. This is my first time on Scoot perhaps the last time.,1
2015,16 March SG to BKK TZ302. 18 March BKK to SG TZ 301. This is my 2nd time taking Scoot to Bangkok this time in their business class. Staff were attentive and quick. Excellent leg space too.,0
2015,19-20 March my first and last trip with Scoot TZ 8 and TZ 7. The cabin crews were fine despite a long delay. From Singapore to Perth I booked a 13.10 hrs flight but the night before I received SMS that stated that my flight was delayed to 16.45 hrs. I arrived at Changi Airport at approximately 14.20 hrs quickly head to departure hall for boarding pass and I saw the flight departure details screen and it stated TZ 8 re-timed to 18.00 hrs! I rushed to the counter for an explanation. The Scoot personnel did not apologise and would not explain the reason for the delay. They gave me a meal coupon of $10 per person. My return flight on 20 March the same thing. I book the 19.10 hrs flight and it was delayed to 22.35 hrs! This is with no meal coupon. I am so disappointed. I am sure that this going to be my first and last trip with Scoot airlines.,1
2015,"Travelled on 21st February the flight was great seats were pre-booked but the food was awful a lot of people complained and left it the croissant my husband had was still half frozen and tasted awful. Lady behind me asked for a cup of water and was told ""you have to pay"". Also paid money to have same seats on the way home a 2 seater were given 3 seater and were told you have a spare seat between you but if someone needs it they have to sit there so why did we pay for special seating. The flight over was great the planes seemed pretty quiet but on the way home with the new Dreamliner it was a lot noisier.",0
2015,Check-in was good meals were atrocious and not what we ordered. After an argument with cabin steward that I certainly did not order beef stew for 6am she got me what I originally ordered (croissants). The meals were awful very oily etc but the Toblerone and soft drinks was good. Take your own snacks and drinks they don't care. I got a free 'gift' of an hours free wifi on board but could not use after 4 attempts to get someone to help me and 3 different cabin crew members telling me they were busy and would come back to me soon I gave up. Staff were useless and unfriendly. Shame because the price is good and seats were fine etc. We also left on time and no delays. Would I fly with them again? The price would have to be amazing and I would be better prepared.,1
2015,Singapore to Perth. No major problems with the plane as it was new. Seats Ok but they have design problem with the button for service which is located on the arm rest. Seats are quite narrow and result is that me and other larger people were always accidentally hitting the button which annoyed the flight attendants and passengers no end. Catering was very disappointing. We pre-ordered wraps for lunch and these came with a drink. Wraps were as tasty as cardboard and drink was choice of coke or green jasmine tea in a can. We did not want either drink and asked if we could have water replacement. Completely surprising answer was that this was not possible with pre- ordered meals. We then thought we would buy something alcoholic - beer was warm so we decided on the wine. Decided on a white and then discovered that this was also warm. These are small things that could easily be handled with a bit more attention to detail and some flexibility by staff to keep passengers happy. Would I fly again probably because of the price but would not bother pre-ordering food and would check what I was getting before ordering anything on board.,0
2015,Hong Kong - Singapore - Perth. Scoot website needs work and trying to use it to alter anything concerning flight ended up with a 30 minute phone call and then a call back and then another call. This did not give me confidence in the quality of the actual flight but was pleasantly surprised. Flew business class and seating legroom was great for 6ft 6 husband and recline was excellent to get a decent sleep. Food was basic but tasty and fine for a short flight. Staff were really friendly and helpful. My daughter traveled economy and was more than happy with the seating. I have flown with many airlines including other budget carriers and full service airlines. We had just come off a Turkish airlines flight and found Scoot better in terms of comfort. I would definitely fly with them again. Website and customer care before the flight needs improvement.,0
2015,SIN to OOL in the first week of January 2015. The overnight flight was most comfortable despite an economy seat. Attentive cabin staff and a landing well ahead of schedule. Scoot continues to impress on this sector.,0
2015,"Flew from Taipei to Singapore On ScootBiz class with my 15 month old son and family. Entire experience was ruined by a rude female attendant who went out of her way to make the flight as unpleasant as possible. My son needed to change his diaper mid flight I didn't expect the stewardess to be helpful but she went out of her way to be as difficult as possible. She refused to let me and my husband enter the toilet together with my son. She insisted that I stand outside the toilet as it was ""against airline regulations"" to have more than 3 people in the toilet! I have flown on many airlines non budget and budget with my son and this is the first airline that has made a fuss and been so unhelpful. Do not fly scoot if you have a young child. I will never fly scoot again.",1
2014,My second time flying with Scoot from Perth to Singapore return. Once again flew ScootBiz class. My trip back in January was on the whole quite satisfactory this time I felt a little disappointed. Staff on the outward flight were very slow and lacked any real interest in the job at hand. Flight left on time and landed early. Return trip departed on time but we were held up by 30 minutes landing at Perth. Food was horrible compared to my previous trip in-flight entertainment not working even with the app downloaded on my iPad. Still fairly good value for the money and ScootBiz seats quite comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Staff clearly need a lot more training on how to manage a large flight.,0
2014,"We flew Scoot on the 23 November 2014 Sydney to Singapore and were very happy with the flight and service. The meal provided was OK. Captain had a good sense of humour ""We are going to Scoot off now"". We would defiantly fly Scoot again.",0
2014,Biz class from Bangkok to the Gold Coast (returning in economy). I could have bought a cheaper ticket on Singapore Airlines or Thai Airlines in economy and got better service if I compare the so-called biz amenities to the economy features of other airlines. Scoot Biz priority boarding poor - only a few moments after calling for the biz section they called everyone else and without a separate line we had to stand in line with everyone else. No hot towel or wipe onboard. One meal only consisting of a small dish that would not feed an adult and a Toblerone. One drink of water in the entire flight one other drink with my meal. InFlight Entertainment nil unless one happens to have an iPad). No blanket or pillow. Scoot has managed to cut costs so much that they are falsely advertising the biz class as something worth paying extra for but in fact it is even below economy in normal airlines. I was particularly appalled that they do not provide water on demand especially on the longer flights. When we arrived at Coolangata the final straw was the use of a single set of stairs that accessed the economy cabin so that the Scootbiz passengers that had paid a premium were among the last to leave the aircraft.,1
2014,"I flew ScootBiz on two flights from Bangkok to Singapore and then from Singapore to Perth. The aircraft's were Boeing 777. The business class cabin was okay but the seats are not able to recline very much. The food was very basic but okay with just one drink being provided with the included fair. This airline needs to improve business class experience to make it worthwhile to ensure that there is priority boarding and exit from the aircraft using separate gate entry lanes and also priority luggage handling. There was no ""crowd"" control by flight staff on leaving the plane in Bangkok - with only 4 passengers in their business class on that flight the cabin was rapidly filled with passengers from economy competing to exit via the business class exit. There is no priority baggage handling for business class passengers. I had been unable to determine from their website how to access the inflight entertainment system with my tablet device so I had not downloaded the appropriate application before boarding the flight and could therefore not use it. I was impressed with the punctuality of the flights for both arrivals and departures being on time.",0
2014,Sydney to Singapore flight departed on time The food and refreshments could only be described as poor especially for an eight hour flight. The streaming entertainment system was intermittent but content was ok. Public address announcements were inaudible most of the time and the staff service level was poor and they seemed to be good at hiding in the galley. Not what we expect from an airline associated with SQ Not a patch on Jetstar Bus/Star Class.,1
2014,Travelled PER-SIN-PER in Biz class selection. This was disappointing to say the least. Had previously travelled in economy seats (standard blue) and actually found no difference in service or comfort. Waste of money paying the extra for Bizclass. The entertainment streaming was unavailable on our flight which made the 5 hour journey seem quite long and tiring. The return flight was delayed 4 hours which totally interfered with our plans and cost us dearly for additional airport drinks and long term parking. We were bussed along with all other passengers to the plane which was still being repaired when we boarded.,1
2014,Just flew Coolangatta - Singapore return Scoot Biz for the third time in two years and as usual excellent for the cost. Flight left and arrived on time both ways cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food is pretty ordinary but have never eaten anything worth talking about on any airline in 50 years of flying. Cabin is clean and seats comfortable excellent value for money. People who complain really need to look at what their saving.,0
2014,Flew TZ7 Perth to Singapore 18th August and returned TZ8 25th August. Medical emergency onboard during the outward journey meant we returned to Perth. Cabin crew were First Class in their handling of the situation. It was our first flight with Scoot and we were more than happy with the flight and service once resumed. We selected yellow seats in the quiet zone a good decision as we are both tall and the extra leg room made for a comfortable journey. The return trip was good also. Last year we did a trip to Japan using Malaysian Airlines and were less than impressed with the service. Their only redeeming factor was a 30kg baggage allowance. On balance we would fly with Scoot again if we could.,0
2014,Fly every few months from Bangkok to Singapore using Scoot the service is always excellent boarding is always on time check in is always easy and most importantly they're always the cheapest airline I can find even when other airlines have promotions Scoot are cheaper. As expected food is expensive and there's little in-flight entertainment apart from Wi-fi (which I got free!) but it's a low cost airline I don't expect it. I just bring a book or iPad. I always fly with Scoot and always recommend Scoot.,0
2014,I booked Scoot for my sister and son SYD to SIN return. Whilst the outgoing flight was smooth and they were allowed to take their snacks on board on the return flight they were not even allowed to bring food/water onboard and being strict vegetarians it was tough as Scoot does not serve/sell anything that is purely vegetarian. The crew were rude and did not pay attention to anyone trying to call them. The tiny bottle of water sold on the plane - $4. A rip-off since they do not allow you to take water on board.,1
2014,Nanjing - Singapore. The crew on board were rude - they were not polite and asked you not to eat anything you brought onboard. The price is not as low as its service definitely not worth it. Some seats were not able to recline and my cup holder was broken. Very uncomfortable flight. I'd rather go to Shanghai next time. Avoid Scoot if you can!,1
2014,Flew Scoot flight TZ7 from Perth to Singapore on 23/06/14. The aircraft was Goin'Scootin the crew were very fast to serve food and were very friendly. The captain however made announcements far too softly. We did not choose our seats and got super seats for free which have more legroom compared to the blue seats. However the seat was not cushioned and was quite hard the flight was quite bumpy so we did not feel relaxed at all. The food served onboard was very expensive but was needed for a 5hr flight. The boarding at Perth was terrible no queues staff not trained.,0
2014,Singapore to Sydney on June 16 the 1.45am flight. We booked bizclass and were very disappointed. The seats were most uncomfortable and the cabin was extremely cold for a night flight having not flown with Scoot before we didn't get any blankets or pillows so we were unable to sleep. For bizclass we got small water and pringles and a soft drink plus our ordered meal at 8am in the morning. We did not feel we got value for money. The ground staff were good but the plane cabin crew were hidden most of the time.,1
2014,Flew with Scoot several times and no complaints so far. Traveled from Singapore to Sydney for about S$200+ return trip (FlyBag) from a sale. We have sat on both standard (Blue) and Super (Yellow) seats and both were comfortable and have very spacious legroom (I could cross my legs with a standard seat). Cabin crew were very friendly and always served us quickly with a smile on their faces. We ordered a Beef Bourguignon Pasta Stew and some snacks on board and despite the small portion the meal was delicious. Other then that the flights were always on time and would definitely fly with Scoot again.,0
2014,TZ 2 19 June SIN/SYD in Scootbiz. Rubbish the cabin crew disappear they muddle the food and they lack the basic standards. Not impressed at all!,1
2014,"Flew economy class (Blue seats) on scoot flight TZ8 from SIN to PER on 16/06/14 and found them nice enough. You might realise that the blue seats are actually cleaner than the yellow seats which have stains. Pilots were very experienced and Scoot was actually a new airline so we were surprised that there was actually Senior first officers. Service from the ""Scootees"" were actually quite fast but they serve food rather slowly. Their English was actually quite nice but sounds unusual. Flight was very smooth and will fly Scoot again in the near future.",0
2014,My husband and I travelled scootBiz return from Sydney to Singapore. Enjoyed the flights both ways and will certainly travel with them again. We are in our sixties and were pleased to have paid extra for the large black comfortable leather seats plus extra leg room. Found the air conditioning on board a bit cool after returned from temperatures of 38*degrees otherwise great!,0
2014,"Gold Coast Airport to Singapore. My friends had previously travelled on this flight and recommended I purchase the extra ""Yellow"" Stretch seats from Rows 21-25. Definitely do this! It cost me $66 extra but was it worth it! I'm close to 6 foot tall so the extra legroom was worth it alone. Food wise I played it safe and ordered the Ham/Cheese croissant and that was fine. I agree that a can of coke and small pringles is not the best ""health"" option but I bought my own food on board and there was no problem with that. Take an empty water bottle to refill. Don't try and take the bottled water through Gold Coast Customs - no go so you'll have to stand there and scull it! Scoot staff were fine and efficient. I can relate to the call button being ""dinged"" continuously due to the major design flaw of where the button is located on the armrest. All up I paid $745 back in January for this airfare and I am happy to do it again - but only in the yellow seats! The layout is 3-4-3 in economy and there were so mighty ""squashed"" people in those seats so invest the extra $70 (and hope that no one has the middle seat!). I agree with other reviewers that this section (Rows 21-25) is child-free and feels like your own little section. Gold Coast Airport Customs/Immigration is certainly not set up to cope with 3-4 International flights arriving at the same time definitely a poor ""first impression"".",0
2014,Scoot provides all the basics that you need at a very affordable price. No complaints. Service was courteous professional and efficient. Will recommend this to anyone who wants to visit or stopover at Singapore.,0
2014,"We have just returned to Sydney from Singapore after a marvellous three-week holiday flying both ways with Scoot. Being a budget-type airline we had no high expectations and were satisfied with both journeys: Sydney to Singapore and Singapore to Sydney. On our forward journey we had chosen the economy blue seats 38A and 38B - and we had a passenger sitting near us on 38C. Found it very cramped. Decided to upgrade for the return journey to the yellow seats and must say that the extra room was well worth the extra payment. I would travel again with Scoot  next time booking the super economy (yellow) seats. With such low air fares you get what you pay for so we can't whinge about being offered coca cola and pringles as a snack! The meal on the return journey (beef wrap) was a huge improvement on the forward journey which was some sort of very ordinary rice concoction. The staff at every step of the way - from when we checked in until we landed were very efficient and courteous. In recommending this airline I would suggest that potential passengers do a bit of homework beforehand and choose a seat that maximises their comfort. The small cabin directly behind business class (rows 21 to 23) are excellent as it is a small cabin which has been declared ""child and baby free"" - so no screaming babies directly nearby. Hope this has been helpful.",0
2014,Our second trip with Scoot to Singapore. One out of Sydney and the latest from the Gold Coast. We aren't exactly the youngest passengers on flights (60's) so the blue seats get a bit (lot) cramped after takeoff plus an hour. This time we splurged and got yellow seats in the back of the plane. Also ordered a meal. Everything worked well and the meals were exactly what is/are required on an 8 hour flight. The small extra cost for the seats was well spent as we were in a bracket of two (window and aisle) and it was only the two of us to sprawl across each other. The cabin crew was/were really good. Spoke good English and didn't seem to be troubled by the usual few fools that adorn every flight! I'd certainly fly Scoot again. Next time to Hong Kong. If I can get a decent Gold Coast to Hong Kong connection. Check-in at the Gold Coast was fast and efficient. Same at Changi. Tip. Take your own Tablet device loaded with your fave TV or Movies. Yep. The battery will expire before the flight lands but by then you will be ready for a few hours of sleep. Also take an empty 500/600ml water bottle on board. Fill it at the water places on the aircraft.,0
2014,I was scheduled to travel on a non-stop Scoot flight from Singapore to Sydney by Business Class a few days ago. The flight was scheduled to take off from Singapore at 1.45am and arrive into Sydney at 12.40pm. The flight got progressively delayed and finally took off around 5.30am. Then for some unknown reason it stopped in Perth before continuing to Sydney. Finally it landed in Sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. I missed my onward connections to Canberra. So moral of the story is that if you have to reach somewhere on time do not travel by Scoot as they are usually late.,1
2014,Have flown with Scoot several times and the planes have been on time and arrived early in some occasions all smooth with check in and bag collection as good as any airline I've used for this. Scoot Biz are much better than any standard seat with other airlines. Food is a bit basic but for the same price as the cheapest fare in economy with 38 inch legroom it's with it. The entertainment does not seem to work on my own devices which is probably the only downside. Overall a good service and will keep using if the price is right.,0
2014,The aircraft was ok and service was almost the same as other budget airlines. However it was delayed 3 hours and 2 hours+ respectively for my 2 flights. I felt uncomfortable that the cabin crew moved my luggage without asking for my consent. The cabin crew are rude they don't give way to passengers when they are selling food and beverages. I stood in the aisle and waited for 10 mins until one moved his cart back a little and I could go back to my seat. Although it is a budget airline they should know we are the customers and they should provide quality service not a budget.,1
2014,Perth to Singapore - Scootbiz. Overall a good product check in very efficient through dedicated Biz desk young man was very friendly and professional he also mentioned we could board the plane as soon as boarding begins. Unfortunately no option to purchase Business Lounge Access at Perth. Boarding was efficient with a call to all Scoot biz to board at the start excellent much improved on last time. Boarded the cabin to realise there were only 4 people of the 32 seat occupied in the Biz section as always we were greeted warmly when boarding the plane. Drink orders were taken before take off and we were allowed any drink on their menu something not offered on our previous trip so improving all the time opted for Singapore slings we were told we would get these after take off. As with Biz we were provided with a small sealed cup of water like you get in economy take off was earlier than expected which I was impressed with. It was about 30 minutes after we took off when we were provided with our pre ordered meal not bad with small can of pringles and a bottle of pre mixed Singapore sling with a cup of ice overall good for budget maybe disappointing for any other service. Once again we were unable to use the entertainment system this time using a tablet instead of a laptop but once again no luck. We rarely saw the cabin staff and they did not come out and give us the code to access the entertainment. Scoot need to look at this as I don't think I'm the only one to have this issue. My favourite part of the experience is the seat its like premium economy comfortable with 38 inch leg room and 20inch width great for a 5 hour flight. Overall its a Premium economy cabin with a budget service.,0
2014,Travelled Perth to Singapore return. Excellent price for return flights. All aspects of the flight were exceptional - easy and quick check in boarding quick and flight comfortable. All flights on time. Staff very helpful and friendly.,0
2014,PER-SIN. Left on time cabin staff actually very good. This trip was better than some full service airlines. Problem in seat 15 - no overhead bin available due to Emergency oxygen and cabin stores and way the divider is set up also blanks out two other bins. Food was able to be eaten (just) and not worth the cost. Scoot should be taken to task as no android service of any kind. The 777's have a better feel up the front than say A320. Seat comfortable wide and lots of leg room in Biz. Excellent cabin staff. Cabin heat was rather hot announcements very hard to hear and garbled. Rest of the deal not worth the hassle.,1
2014,Gold Coast to Singapore December 23rd 2013. Singapore to Gold Coast January 7th 2014. If you want a budget airline with no frills substandard food at premium prices that charges you every time you blink then this airline is for you. I can understand extra for food drinks (even water) entertainment but to charge you for checking in early is a pathetic money grabbing option. Only $5 but no mention of fee at early check-in sign at airport after queuing in line for 20 minutes and many complaints from other passengers a staff member came from behind the counter to tell you of the charge when you are two passengers from the counter and by the time we got to the counter we were only 5 minutes early. However the aircraft was clean seat comfortable (just a little narrow) but plenty of legroom. Will not travel with thrm again if other airlines are available.,1
2014,Traveled PER-SIN only. The ground staff were nice enough to ask if I wanted a window seat or aisle seat during check in. Boarding went pretty quickly. The crew were helpful with my carry-on luggage on board. There were some problems with the passenger call bell button and it was quite worrying. (Probably just an old aircraft. The seats looked old and dirty but overall very spacious and comfortable. The cabin seemed warm and stuffy throughout the flight though). Safety and budget transportation was definitely the main focus of the airline. In safety aspects the crew did their seatbelt checks after the turbulence announcement and constantly doing toilet-checks and house-keeping often. Announcements by the crew could be improved in terms of clarity audibility and tone of voice. I did not try the inflight entertainment and purchase any meals. But the menu of the inflight meals and the list of inflight entertainment seemed interesting and a bit on the steep side. However definitely use this airline again because of the price and comfort.,0
2014,SIN-PER-SIN. Both flights were on time we paid to choose our seats (basic ones) and got them. We filled our bottles with water prior to boarding and carried with us some burgers and snacks. Although they announce that food purchased from outside is not allowed to be consumed many people have a bite and no one says anything - I would recommend this option over purchasing the inflight food especially as many people have said that it is not good. We watched our own movies on our iPad so entertainment wasn't an issue either. Safety measures were taken very seriously and the cabin crew were responsive when they were called for. I would definitely recommend this airline it does what it says on the tin and at a very decent price. If you want all the frills and creature comforts beyond a nice seat safety and being on time don't go for it.,0
2014,Gold Coast - OOL late Nov. If you like eating poor quality food pitiful ground staff and substandard customer service then Scoot is for you! Offered ScootBiz upgrade which supposedly included unlimited drinks during meal service and a blanket. This was not the case and we got nothing but a better seat for our $169! Customer service has done nothing. Boarding took forever as ground staff were incompetent with only one staff member. I understand you get what you pay for but this airline doesn't even offer that! A very low cost airline.,1
2014,6-10th Jan. PER-SIN-PER. Service in the cabin was non-existent I couldn't get anyone to come to my seat with my service light on for hours I gave up. Both flights there and back were cold particularly the outbound flight. The aircon was broken it was freezing and we weren't offered different seats even though there were many available that were much warmer. Eventually given a free blanket hours later. The sorting out of pre-booked meals is stupid. It takes hours to get all the pre-booked meals delivered and meanwhile there is no service from the cabin crew you cant get a drink or anything until about 2-3 hours into the flight. For these reasons I would only choose to fly Scoot again if the fare is very cheap.,0
2014,Flew ScootBiz from PER-SIN-PER for a family holiday. After reading other reviews people must realise you get what you pay for! I am 6 ft 5 and found the seats in ScootBiz cabin perfectly comfortable. I have flown Singapore airlines on the same route and yes they are a first class airline no doubt but a fare which cost less than half of what a Singapore Airlines economy seat fare does the issue stops. Food included with the ticket was OK plane was on time and clean. Forget all the other whinging gripes people have if you want an airlines which offers the bare basics but an affordable trip go for Scoot if you need to have your every whim and desire satisfied go with a full service carrier. Will happily fly Scoot again in the future.,0
2014,Flew ScootBiz: Singapore-Tokyo-Singapore via Taipei. The seats we booked miraculously disappeared on check-in and we had to sit separately on the return journey. The free inflight entertainment in ScootBiz was non-existent and cabin crew said the cabin wifi system wasn't working properly. We won't fly Scoot again and we wouldn't dream of recommending it to anyone.,1
2014,PER-SIN-PER. The website was difficult to access and understand let alone come to grips with what was on offer. A bad decision was to opt for payment of excess baggage (over 15kg) at the airport which cost $264. Boarding was chaotic the plane eventually departing 35 minutes late. My wife ordered a meal that would not be fit for a dog's consumption mine being a concoction which was barely edible. Onboard in the equivalent of premium economy the seats were sufficiently comfortable for a 5 hour flight but no more. There would appear to be very little the cabin crew knew of basics that is so superbly demonstrated by its parent company. While in Singapore I tried to pay for baggage through the website and only with the assistance of a family member was this achieved after 3 days of trying. The return flight was about 40% capacity and the service was still below average. Duty free shopping was not on a trolley but was available at the rear galley of the plane (no announcement to this effect). I did like the list of passenger seat numbers showing who had ordered food on line - a scrappy piece of cardboard stuck to one of the cupboards. Sure it's a budget airline but all the basics are missing.,1
2014,PER-SIN-PER just after Christmas as the fares were incredibly cheap (less than $850 for three people to SIN and back). Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot. I was actually surprised that something so bad could actually come from Singapore. Only recommended on the basis of price.,0
2014,Travelled Perth to Singapore on new route. Checking in was straight forward and plane on time. When boarding they asked people at the back of the plane to board first not sure what seat numbers this included. Got on board and had a stretch seat plenty of leg room which was great news being over 6 foot. Generally the seats are more comfortable than any budget airline I have travelled did notice the 3-4-3 is much tighter than the 3-3-3 with Singapore Airlines on the same plane but was ok. Food and tablet arrived quickly once we took off and I was seated very close to back of plane. Big issue was that they collected tablet an hour before we landed I managed to watch one movie and half of another. Even with watching tablet as soon as I received and whilst eating. Food was tasty and very spicy with a can of coke and a small pack if Pringles this was a pre paid meal. Overall a very good service comparable to other economy services better than any budget airline I have travel led with. When booking look at what's important to you if the price is better than economy go for it.,0
2014,Singapore to Perth. Checked in 30 minutes early no problem. Had to remind check in that we had business lounge and asked for process and direction also had to ask for tag for hand luggage as given on previous trip. Lounge which cost extra was operated by SATS comfortable and better than Qantas lounge we used recently. Good food and drink choice massage chair and internet. No loungers or flat chairs. Boarded plane easily not sure if announcer asked Scoot Biz to board but we got on with no issues. Comfort in seats good I would rate cabin and seats as comparable with premium economy as I've travelled business and generally seats are much wider. Service was good with getting water at start of flight and meal promptly after take off. Would be good to get another drink later in flight to make it more biz style. My big issue was with taking my own laptop on and not getting it to work I downloaded at home before going but could not get it working. My advice hire a tablet for $20 or take your own entertainment. It's a shame as this was the only negative of the experience. Flights all good on timings. Overall it's a premium economy seat with a basic economy/ budget service if the comfort of the seat is important to you then worthwhile.,0
2013,Thought we would give them a try as fares were reasonable but it's nowhere near business class good legroom on seats but more like a bad premium economy. Crew weren't really interested in customers. 30-40 minutes for them to answer a call for a drink on TZ1 Sydney to Singapore on the way back they were quicker. In scoot biz you can bring your own device for entertainment and not be charged everyone who I saw couldn't get it to work. Crew were more interested in chatting in the galley than helping. Try another airline.,1
2013,Singapore to Sydney Nov 2013. Left on time both directions. Got yellow seats for extra space and it was worth it for additional leg room. Service was OK but cool and not very welcoming. Meals which we ordered in advance are poor and don't recommend them other than the Sandwiches and pot noodles which you can buy 'on the go'. The plane was full both ways. The worst experience was the freezing cabin on both flights so much so we became convinced that this was done to 'encourage' us to invest in renting pillows and blankets. I would look for an alternative service for future flights.,1
2013,Flew Sydney to Singapore ScootBiz. Seats hard no recline and 100mls of tepid water free! Save your money! Food was disgraceful had to purchase everything and took 50mins to claim our luggage from the carrousel. Jetstar is first class compared to Scoot so stick to Aussie budget airlines.,1
2013,Flew SIN-BKK-SIN. Plane was ok although a bit old as these were old SQ planes. But considering some other airlines it is still an acceptable age plane. I guess Scoot didn't do much rework of the interiors as they are expecting new planes to be delivered. The legroom in ScootBiz was ok. Seats was ok and was neither comfortable or uncomfortable. It could have been better if food was better there were more drinks that could be offered to ScootBiz class. However I may choose an economy class (exit row seat) on its parent company Singapore Airlines anytime if the price difference is not huge.,0
2013,Flown on TZ2 SIN-SYD and TZ1 SYD-SIN recently on FlyBag ticket. Scoot's website is user friendly. Check-in at Singapore's Changi Airport and Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was fast friendly and efficient. On board planes 9V-OTE and 9V-OTA looked well maintained. The interior was clean and had a fresh look. Seats are not too uncomfortable with good legroom. However the light and call attendant buttons were too easily triggered by passengers shifting about in their seats. Pleasantly surprised that the cabin staff regularly ensure that the toilets are cleaned and freshened. They seem to put a lot of effort into it which I greatly appreciate as an almost full load both ways result in heavy toilet usage. Captain and first officer spoke very clearly when making announcements something I seldom experienced when travelling with other airlines even full-service ones. Food however is not fantastic and leaves much to be desired. Overall a good experience with Scoot and may consider flying with them again.,0
2013,"We were flying BKK to SYD but found better value flights booking BKK-SIN separate to the long haul flight strangely. Booking system is great and very flexible. You can pick and choose say Business one leg and economy return. Our SYD-SIN flight was cancelled and Scoot automatically re-booked us 1 day earlier. This didn't suit us so agreed to change at no extra cost and also changed the next leg returning to BKK bought on a separate booking. Also impressive from an LCC. Flew Business class from BKK to SIN return because the marginal extra costs wasn't that much more. Good seat pitch space. Not too full. Leather seats a little hard but OK. Food ordered was changed but no big deal on short flight. Staff were never rude but they were not overly friendly which was a surprise given their supposed ""Scootitude"" (attitude). Bought Business for the late night overnight SIN to SYD because we wanted space to sleep and was glad. Very empty with only 8 passengers so we all shuffled around and had a bench each. Except that 2 of the 3 middle row arm rests would not lift up so it wasn't really a bed. Worse luck! On this leg the staff were very attentive and around. On the daylight return SYD to SIN we flew the extra space yellow seats in the child free front economy cabin. This was very good and highly recommended. Great amount of space and worth the slight extra premium charge. Had an excellent meal on this leg with free rum and coke. Again not much attention from the staff to be honest but remember this is LCC. Only one minor point was that when we checked in for one leg we wanted to upgrade to buy the business lounge service in SIN and were told that it was too late. Rules are rules but there was at least 2 hours to go before the flight and that seemed petty to me frankly. I had been hoping to use a tablet for the entertainment but the system doesn't support a tablet. Pity but no big deal. Lastly all 4 flights were extremely punctual. I was surprised. All in we will definitely fly Scoot again. Great value and a pleasant surprise. But as with any LCC don't have high expectations and you won't be disappointed.",0
2013,I was pleasantly surprised by Scoot. I was in the middle section where kids are not allowed which was lovely as there were about 10 down in coach who all cried at the same time poor parents. I had the upgrade with food blanket and tablet to watch movies. Didn't use the blanket and eye mask as day time and food was too salty to eat. Staff were good and toilets were cleaned a number of times during the flight which was good. I would fly with them again and recommend.,0
2013,"Nov 8 2013 BKK-SIN-SYD on ""scoot-thru"" Biz fare carry-on only. Originally advised of 1 hour delay which blew out to 2 hours with air-bridge problem at BKK and change of gate - not Scoot's fault. Departed at 10pm instead of 8.05pm. Biz section half full bulk head seats offer less leg room so moved to aisle seat further back. Seat not very comfortable less so then Premium economy on full-service airlines. Couldn't sleep much. Service friendly but minimal. Had to queue in SIN for SYD boarding pass. Why can't they supply both passes at origin? Just a money earner I think though no charge on the Biz fare. Offered water on boarding in SIN and asked if I'd like a drink. Opted for a beer which never appeared until breakfast time! Drinks on Scoot are apparently served with meals only. Flew Emirates Bus class 2 weeks prior - from the sublime to the ridiculous! AirAsia Premium a much better product though considerably more expensive.",1
2013,Sector 1 - SIN-TPE in economy. The service and seats are ok but the reading light was not working. It is basically a no frills budget airlines. But comparing to other LCCs Scoot is operating on a bigger airplane and the comfort is substantially better. Sector 2 - TPE-SIN on Scoot BIZ. Decided to upgrade at the counter. Again the reading light was not working. Seat is wider and the recline is better. Food comes with a small main course pringles and a drink. They also offer free streaming videos and games but those who recently upgraded to apple's IOS 7 be warned. It is currently not compatible. Overall I am satisfied with the service provided.,0
2013,Flew from Singapore to Sydney in Oct. Had early check-in which was very good as had 6 hour stay in Singapore. Very efficient staff at airport very helpful. Flight wise very good minor delay but a good flight. My only concern is that when purchasing food or drink on board unless you give correct money you don't get any change! So future traveller be warned.,0
2013,Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore using Scoot Thru Purchased upgrade at check in for $179 to business class was told luggage was checked right through to final destination being Bangkok. Arrive Changi Connect transfer desk to receive boarding pass to Bangkok told that Gold Coast would not have checked luggage in and if I wanted to travel I would have to pay $55 as luggage was in a transfer container. Explained whole story they admitted their mistake but didn't care $55 or no travel. Seats in business Very hard and recline at odd angle making sleep impossible economy much much worse stick to Air Asia much better product!,1
2013,Gold Coast to Singapore return. Good efficient check-in friendly staff. Flight on time seating fine if you are short but if you are over 6ft would recommend buying Super Seats. Haven't tried there food it is expensive compared to Air Asia water is expensive but you can take your empty water bottle onboard and fill it up. Flight from Singapore also on time and efficient boarding. I purchased the Ipad and had two good movies. Overall for a Budget Airline I think they are very good.,0
2013,First time I have flown Scoot. I have never experienced such nonsense all at once from one airline. first they changed my flight and then refused to let me change it to a suitable date. Then they changed my meal from a hot meal to sandwiches which I already paid for as an option. Then they lost my baggage even though I paid extra so that they would specifically look after my baggage. Also the seats are a nightmare with no headrest and are very cramped. I had to pay extra to change back the date so this was no cheap trip.,1
2013,We travelled to Tokyo on 2nd October from Singapore with a transit at Taipei. This is our second time travelling with Scoot and both times we were quite happy with the airline. It is a budget airline and it delivers exactly what it promises. The seats are by far the most comfortable of all budget airlines that we have used and the food quite decent and not exorbitant. I had not pre-booked a meal reading reviews that food is bad but when we ordered on board we found it quite good. One tip would be to order sandwiches or food that does not need to be heated. The transit at Taipei was smooth and we reached Narita on the dot. Only reason I have not given it full marks is that we had pre-booked iPad for my daughter and the stewardess first said they had none that were working. When I insisted on the fact that we had already booked and they should refund our money she promptly brought the iPad to us. But it was a small point in an overall good journey. Scoot remains our first choice in budget airlines.,0
2013,Sydney to Singapore return. First the positives: the planes were well maintained the FAs were friendly the food was basic but fine and I did not mind paying extra for the frills. Now the negatives: the seats were uncomfortable the legroom was poor (I'm 6 ft 6 so an exit row seat in economy would have been better) the movie selection was dreadful the FAs were inexperienced and the 2.10 am departure time from Singapore to Sydney is a killer. It was an overall charmless experience which was not offset by the admittedly competitive price.,1
2013,SIN-TPE-SIN in September. Both legs were on time leg room was good for a low cost carrier and check-in was smooth. Excellent value for money.,0
2013,4 of us travelled SYD-SIN-SYD in Sept and Oct 2013. I will definitely travel with Scoot again. Ground staff and cabin crew were great. Yellow seating was great for 6 foot tall family members. We did not use the inflight entertainment as we had good books and ipad for music and we did not eat their food. They hit you 4 dollars for a small bottle of water so bringing your own empty one is a good idea. You are not meant to bring your own food aboard but it seems many do and have no issues from staff. Booking online was fine once I took the time to figure out all the options. We used the Scoot lounge in Singapore and will do this again too. Shower good food wine spirits fruit coffee internet massage chairs all good. We were on time out bound and 30 min late on our return but this was fully explained by the pilot as because of air traffic control. It could have happened to any airline. The planes seemed to be very new. Scoot does it for me.,0
2013,Taipei to Singapore in September. Efficient check-in at counter. No web check in. Staff friendly. Chose standard seat. Leg space was good (unlike some budget airlines with the front seat right up to your knees). Seat was rather uncomfortable - hard no lower back support - couldn't sleep all night. Hefty 4% visa processing fee shown only after payment (not included in fare like JetStar). Will use again but will bring small pillow for back.,0
2013,I rebooked my flight because of family bereavement. My original booking was upgraded to business class from yellow coloured seat I booked earlier. I paid the penalty for my flight Gold Coast to Singapore. Less than 12 hours before my flight I realized that my seat allocation had gone. Not only the business class upgrade but also the yellow coloured seat. If I want to return to my original seat I have to pay again 14 Singapore dollars which I am not happy to do but no choice. What surprises me is that Scoot can give yellow coloured seat number 52 for free but not my original seat number 23. It just does not make sense to me. First I lost my seat allocation and upgrade to business class now Scoot asked me for SGD 14 at the last minute. I won't be flying Scoot again. It is useless to be a loyal Scoot flyer.,1
2013,SIN-SYD-SIN. Booked Super seats and prepaid meal on both legs. Ordinary airline food nothing much to talk about. The Super seat pitch was much more than any legacy airlines economy seats it is even better than SIA economy seats. As long as you comes prepared bring your own travel pillow blanket (or jacket) an empty bottle for water plus your own tablet or notebook for entertainment you are going to have a very enjoyable flight. Will definitely fly with them again no problem.,0
2013,Flew Singapore to Gold Coast on Scoots Boeing 777 yesterday and had a most comfortable trip. This is the fourth time I have flown Scoot. Not being able to interline the bags during transit is a chore especially if you have a tight transit. If on the other hand you have a long wait between flights the Sin$5 early check-in facility is a godsend. Ground and flight staff were excellent.,0
2013,Traveled from SIN on 30th Aug and I must say I was impressed with Scoot! I took the blue seat (aisle) and found it very comfortable (don't forget your shoulder cushion). Then again I'm only 174cm in height so I wouldn't know about the rest. The only (small) problem was the crew kept bumping into me in the middle of the night when walking down the aisle during service but I wasn't too disturbed. Immigration in OOL is really strict! A staff member insisted on weighing all our bags and charging us for all the excess baggage so beware. Food (biryani) was good albeit small in portion and they have 2 water dispensers in the middle of the plane. Don't worry too much and just enjoy your flight! I would definitely fly with them again and recommend them.,0
2013,Travelled from Gold Coast Australia to Singapore return. Easy and fast check-in with nice and professional staff at hand. Flight was good and both seats and food ordered was fine. Cannot expect 5 star restaurant food on a discount airline and generally most airline seats are not really that comfortable in any economy classes. Rented a tablet for flight but found it a bit boring so will probably rely on Ipad etc for future flights with Scoot. Will fly Scoot again should we have that option.,0
2013,Was a bit sceptical flying business class on a LCC. But it worked perfectly. SIN-BKK on a rather old but well kept 777. Seat pitch ok for the short flight was addressed by name food very tasty. Flight was on time and thanks to the complementary streaming IFE I did not get bored. It was better than a C class flight of a similar length on Qatar the day before but at a fraction of the cost.,0
2013,Went on a family trip from Singapore to Gold Coast in June 2013. Chose the yellow seats with extra leg space and they are quite comfortable. The seats at the back looks too cramp for me but it is much cheaper for those who don't mind the space. We didn't rent any entertainment on board as we came prepared. The service on ground and in the air are excellent. Thank you Scoot for the pleasant experience.,0
2013,"One-way economy Coolangatta-Taipei (via 8 hour layover Singapore). Departure and arrival on schedule. Paid extra for a ""yellow"" seat with more leg room; 5+ kg luggage; and ScootThru. Later decided to upgrade to ScootBiz but the website does not allow for upgrading. Check-in very crowded slow and understaffed. Avoided the crowd by going to the ScootBiz counter and upgrading but could only upgrade to Singapore. I had to upgrade Singapore- Taipei at Changi. ScootBiz is not luxurious. Seat is a little wider and with a power outlet. Metal foot rest is uncomfortable. Meal was a sandwich and a small can of Pringles plus a drink. Flight crew were young energetic all very nice and well groomed. The pilot and crews English pronunciation were mostly incomprehensible. Entertainment package - you login using a special PIN. There are no instructions on how to set up your computer. No one from Scoot will help you. Upon arrival in Singapore I went to the Transfer counter in Lounge E Terminal 2 to get my new boarding pass. Transfer desk had 2 people working I waited 45 minutes. At Changi Airport I had gone to the Widevine Media Optimizer website and downloaded the entertainment browser add-on after which it installed without a problem. The entertainment system then worked from Singapore to Taipei. All-in-all if you are looking for a reliable and cheap no frills airline Scoot is okay. Every extra will cost you some money.",0
2013,We found Scoot to be very satisfactory when traveling to Singapore. The check-in was quick as was boarding and the in-flight staff were nice. We had no problems and will fly Scoot again.,0
2013,OOL-SIN. Had opportunity to upgrade to scootbiz was worth every cent even with the extra cost was still cheaper then full service carrier - would recommend.,0
2013,OOL to SIN. Upgraded to ScootBiz at Gold Coast Airport. Check in was running very smoothly. It is important to recognise that ScootBiz is not a business class cabin it is akin to Premium Economy. Food was reasonable comfy seat and good leg room (similar to exit row in economy). First time using the GoGo streaming IPad app on board - worked a treat. Overall the airfare was approx 50% cheaper than the legacy airlines heading to Singapore from BNE. Well worth a try.,0
2013,"Their customer service is appalling staff are the rudest airline staff I've come across. I flew ""business class"" from Sydney to Singapore and I hated the experience. Check-in was chaotic with the supposedly dedicated business class line checking in a large group of economy class passengers. When I approached I was told to wait at the end of that line even though I was a business class passenger. No lounge access at Sydney airport. The main problem was onboard. Their business class seats were inferior to several major carrier's economy seats. Hardly enough legroom and the person behind was constantly bumping the back of my seat. Recline on the seats was minimal as to be unnoticeable. No inflight entertainment and all that was on offer was a miserable tablet pre-loaded with 3 movies which was not free not even for business class passengers. The food was horrible and simply consisted of a bottle of water and a container with brown heated goo in it. No way is it comparable to other low cost airlines operating in Australia.",1
2013,Return flights Gold Coast - SIN - return. We booked this flight to add on to our onward European flights. We saved over A$1000 by SCOOTing from the GC to SIN then picking up Malaysian airlines from there to London instead of flying from BNE direct. A 7-8 hr flight is not hard work so we chose the Fly-Bag option and ate before we flew on both sectors. We paid to select extra legroom seats and travelled the equivalent of premium economy seat pitch and were very comfortable. Flights ran on time - and arrived ahead of schedule in both directions. Staff courteous and attentive. They cleaned the toilets at least 3 times an hour - more frequently than on any other plane Ive been on. I would not hesitate to recommend or fly them again. If you're aware its a low cost airline and go prepared with a meal in your belly your own iPad and a book and perhaps purchase a coffee on board and opt for the extra legroom - you can bag yourself a bargain.,0
2013,"Flew on Scoot from Seoul (ICN) to Singapore (SIN) via Taipei (TPE). Transfer was horrible. Scoot uses a ""transfer card"" system where passengers need to queue up to receive the card before entering the transfer security line however there weren't any signs that tell us anything about this process. Transfer cards are given by EVA Air staff process is very inefficient and slow. There were also no Korean speaking staff and we did see lots of Korean passengers queuing in the wrong line or walking to the wrong place because of the confusing transferring lines.",1
2013,Gold Coast to Singapore return early May. Left on time both directions. Got yellow seats for extra space and it was worth it for additional leg room. Can't complain at all. Service was good and efficient. Meals are ok not perfect but adequate. Check in both ways was efficient and friendly without long lines even the plane was full both ways. Paid extra 5 dollars at Singapore for early check in and spent nice time at Singapore airport which is amazing! Luggage arrived safely too. Great service and price - will use again!,0
2013,"Flew with them SYD-SIN one year ago the legroom for economy was very good the best within the LCCs however I just recently flew with them again and it is a recently configured plane from an old used SQ plane and I realize that the seat pitch is about 1/2 to 1 inch smaller. With more planes their departure and arrival times have improved a lot. Service is average they tried the ""no outside food"" rule on me just ignore them and have your own food. Note their arrival time to SIN is about 8pm at night so you probably need a night in SIN if you book onward flights consider that cost when compared to flying direct with full service airline.",1
2013,"We just got back from 4 weeks away in Asia. We took Scoot to Singapore for around $AUD200 (each) including 15kg each and a meal. There is nothing flash about this airline but the room between rows was acceptable! The staff were efficient and the food was OK. We bought ""FlyBagEat"" however you have to add on the cost of a seat to this fare how are you going to fly without a seat? The ""convenience fee"" of a $10 was added (apparently for credit card)! All in all we had no complaints about the trip over. We also booked a trip back but as this leaves at 2.10am we decided to buy a super seat for about an extra $40 each. This turned out to be worth every cent - we booked a seat in aisle 21 just behind business class and had the bulkhead in front. My husband could stretch his legs and we didn't have anyone in front so didn't have to worry about anyone wanting to recline their seat. On the way back we arrived at 5pm at Changi with luggage for a flight leaving at 2am. It cost us $5 each for the early check-in and you have to pay in cash. One good value deal was access to the SATS lounge for $S39 each. This allows you to use the lounge for 4 hours (consecutive use). This was a wonderful oasis for us. Also you get priority boarding which is a real asset at 2am in the morning! I thought the breakfast was revolting (fried mushrooms a sausage of sorts a triangle of some egg dish (omelette perhaps) and a soggy hash brown. You have to remember these dishes have been kept warm for the last 6 hours or so. One redeeming feature was some fresh fruit and a drink of orange juice. We would definitely fly Scoot again especially now we know some of the lurks!",0
2013,Sydney to Singapore return. Outward leg May 3 return May 26. ScootBiz is a 100% premium over the economy cabin and it just isn't worth it. Is more legroom more incline and free meal worth double? Is priority check in a bonus when your bags are the last to be unloaded at the other end? Scoot will have to increase its 'biz' offer substantially or lower the premium (substantially) to have me flying it again.,1
2013,BKK-SIN out April 28th return May 31st. Very disappointing in most ways. Poor food selection poor rambling hard to understand communication inexperienced and abrupt service from a small but significant number of the flight and ground crew. It sets out to be cool and trendy and ends up feeling shabby. Poor staff training and on the ground service levels are simply too poor to match the ideals.,1
2013,Depending on whether the flight is full or not your experience on Scoot will change dramatically. On a full flight you will experience the worst most uncomfortable seat in an aircraft. When the passenger in front of you decides to sleep and put their seat down low its back will be directly in front of your face. Thin seats extremely narrow not recommended for medium-long hauls.,1
2013,Scootbiz from Singapore to Shenyang China. Departure 20 mins late they served us food around 2.15am. If you couldn't eat at that time they could store your food for you and serve it to you as breakfast before arriving in Shenyang. The one hour transit in Qingdao was a tiring process - you are expected to bring along all your hand carry luggage with you. You have to clear all immigration in Qingdao. On our return flight Scoot was on time and even arrived 30 min earlier in Singapore. Seat was quite wide and rather comfy. No food served from Shenyang to Qingdao. Luckily we had brought enough of our own food. Both iPads and blankets could be rented and bought. We brought along our own iPads and downloaded their system before the flight. Overall though initially we have had a nightmarish experience of trying to change our destination from Shenyang to Tokyo everything about the Scootbiz experience was surprisingly nice for a budget airline.,0
2013,Flew BKK-SIN-BKK. Simply the best low-cost experience I've had. The flight was simply perfect from very clear online sales (unlike Air Asia and other airlines with unclear pricing and everything piles on at the end). Using a wide body is not an issue but the seats and the seat pitch was very generous more than legacy carriers - The seat pitch was incredible. Crew very young but professional. Good selection of food and drinks on board. Hoping they'll add frequencies to Bangkok as they currently have only 1. Recommending them for sure.,0
2013,In terms of airline value for money for an 8 hour flight from Sydney to Singapore ScootBiz is about the best there is. It was certainly well worth the $139 surcharge (which I paid on check-in when offered the option) on top of the extremely low economy fare. The cabin was spacious and uncrowded and the seats comfortable with plenty of legroom and a fully adequate recline. The food and wine was very simple but perfectly acceptable. Food and drink over and above the initial meal has to be paid for separately but prices are reasonable. Service was good. The flight was on time. Well recommended.,0
2013,"5 hours delay due to ""unknown engineering problem"" no notification in advance and during the whole 5 hours Scoot representatives repeat helplessly we do not know when and if the flight will resume we'll notify you when we know. No vouchers or any compensation was offered. Terrible service even for a budget flight. It was first and last time for me to travel with budget airline.",1
2013,"SYD-SIN in ScootBiz. Booked Economy class but added all extras as Scoot were offering a possibility of being upgraded. This did not happen but I was able to pay for an upgrade at the airport for a very reasonable price. Check in looked chaotic but I was checked in at the sales desk after I was upgraded. Flight itself was delayed slightly at Sydney (20 mins) but on-board the crew were very genuine and friendly and the seat was very comfortable although there were a few issues of lights going on and off. The way some people choose to sit seems to activate the lights which isn't really the passengers fault. The food was not particularly satisfying and because I don't have a tablet device I couldn't take advantage of the free ""ScootTV"". Upon arrival in Singapore I was getting slightly anxious about my connection because added to the delay was a ground delay of around 45 minutes waiting for a ground power unit after the original one (so the Captain explained) was faulty. Loved Scoot and loved the value of ScootBiz.",0
2013,Flew ScootBiz Sydney-Singapore-Taipei-Tokyo-Singapore-Sydney. 6 flights in total. All on time and even arriving early in most cases. Great onboard service and Scootbiz is a fantastic premium (not Business) product. We have also flown Economy with Scoot before and we cannot speak highly enough of the benefits of this new low cost airline.,0
2013,Last Sunday morning we went to Gold Coast Airport bound for Singapore. On arrival we were greeted by a cheerful woman behind a separate Biz Counter who processed our details within a couple of minutes. When boarding was called the usual crowd surged to the front. As advertised there was a special entry aisle for Scoot Biz Class but it was hard to see because of the crowd. We were actually first on board and our seats were as planned. As soon as we sat down we were served with cold water with a friendly greeting. A lot has been said about the Biz Class seats and some of it sadly is true but travellers must remember the fare is about a quarter of what other Australian airlines charge and half of that charged by rival Air Asia. They don't leave a lot of elbow room and don't recline to the floor but they are on the whole fairly comfortable for the money we paid. The food was nothing special it was tasty.,0
2013,I flew with Scoot last month to Singapore we had booked into economy class and upgraded to the nicer seats. My partner and I were happy with this arrangement knowing that it was only a 7-8 hour flight to Singapore we thought we could easily keep ourselves entertained etc. When we went to check-in on the morning of our flight we got offered to the ScootBiz for a few hundred more we decided to go ahead with the upgrade as we had the money to do so I think all up it cost about $550-600 each. ScootBiz was awesome and well worth the extra. I have flown Premium Economy with JAL before and it was terrible compared to ScootBiz. ScootBiz had good leg-room and nice wide seats you get to board first and get off first you get served when you want it. We took our own drinks and food on the plane and we were happy. ScootBiz gives you a meal and drink of your choice as well. I had read some horror stories but I found staff to be friendly and helpful.,0
2013,SYD-SIN. Flight was 2 hours late leaving SYD and we arrived in SIN one hour behind scheduled time. Check in at SYD was quick even with plenty of people waiting before me for check-in to open. Staff were attentive and smiling. I had a stretch seat (yellow) at the rear of the aircraft cost me an additional AUD $24. Leg room was great and seat was comfy enough. I didn't eat the airline food I took my own sandwiches. I didn't hire the inflight tablets I read a book. Drinking water was available on the flight near the toilets in the middle of the economy section. Overall for a one-way ticket that cost $240 all up I was pleased with the value for money. I would fly Scoot again if I needed to.,0
2013,Sydney to Singapore. The check-in was quick and left on time. Cabin crew cheerful and energetic. I did not select anything to eat when I booked the tickets but ordered from foods available on menu inflight. The hot Italian veggie food was tasty and filling - about 8 AUD which is quite cheap. I found their menu to be reasonably priced. The leg space was sufficient. I observed that leg space of some seats (yellow) for which you need to pay extra was large especially the first row. When you book online you have options of paying by credit card or through POLI using your bank account. I chose the second option of going through bank and had to wait for more than 24 hrs for the bank transfer to complete and ticket delivered. I also had to do few follow-ups with their customer centre. If people are travelling within the next 2 or 3 days of booking I suggest to use credit-card which should result in a ticket immediately. Overall very satisfied with my first experience with Scoot and happy that I saved about $A350 for my one- way trip to Singapore by booking Scoot.,0
2013,Brisbane to Bangkok return. We paid $1430 for four of us to fly to Bangkok return. I had a couple of queries prior to flying and emails were promptly replied to and information provided. All four flights on time. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient. We did pre-order a meal Coolangatta to Singapore which admittedly I will not be doing again - the worst airline meal I have ever had. We learnt our lesson and didn't worry with the on board food service again. I noticed a number of reviewers complained about lengthy check-in queues - perhaps we were lucky but we had no such difficulties. I should mention that between the four of us we did only have 3 small backpacks which were less then 7kg in weight and we checked them in as cabin luggage. On the way home we did arrive at both Bangkok and Singapore airports quite early (around 3.5 hours) due to an early flight from Koh Samui and an overnight in Singapore. So we were the first ones to check in. this worked in our favour as we were for some reason automatically upgraded to the yellow seats on both sectors. they are definitely more comfy and have more leg room then the blue seats. However to be honest we are not big people (average height average build) so the blue seats were fine for us anyway if you were taller or bigger in size it may be more uncomfortable I guess. Overall we had a great experience with Scoot. The price was incredibly cheap at just over $1400 for four of us.,0
2013,Sydney to Singapore last August. Sydney ground staff were really good except for one. The seats were like concrete after a few hours. Taking the Kindle was a great idea. No inflight entertainment except at added expense. The food that passengers ordered at extra cost looked quite palatable. Cabin staff were really nice. Seats are a bit narrow. Leg room is constricted. Take a snack from the post customs food shops to get you to Singapore. If traveling on from Singapore allow time for possible delays. Changi Airport is user friendly. Free internet. Bus tours of the city. Movie areas for the kids. All of the International fast food outlets.,0
2013,We flew Scoot from the Gold Coast in early April and the experience left me feeling pretty flat. Serious delays on all 3 sectors. This airline seems to be regularly running late. The ticket price may be cheap but the delays make the airline poor value for money.,1
2013,Traveled on March 25 Sydney to Singapore and have no complaints with our flight at all. Flight left about 10 mins early and arrived into SIN on time. Booked the extra leg room seats up front and the additional cost was worth it. Airline food is airline food when sitting in economy with any airline not to flash.,0
2013,"Flight from Sydney to Singapore on Feb 21 2013 was 10 hours delayed no text message nor email prior to this and no offer of apology or any meal vouchers. Upon boarding passengers notice a lot of empty yellow seats in the middle whilst everyone was cramped seated right at the back then asked the crew to transfer to which they replied ""you have to pay extra A$68"". After all the taxes and their add ons fees this airline is not cheap. We missed our connecting flights hotel pick up and a night accommodation with no apology. Never again.",1
2013,Flew to Singapore with our 3 kids the flight over was quite pleasant we paid extra for yellow seats with more room which made a lot of difference. The business class seats were available for a $100 upgrade which came with free lease of ipads. Stewardesses were very polite although a little difficult to understand. Meals were pretty good. Flight home was late at night - a little cramped with 2 adults and 3 kids on 4 seats while everyone else had 3 seats to themselves to spread out and sleep. A lot of people whinge about this kind of airline but you get what you pay for! We got value for money and would not hesitate to fly with them again!,0
2013,Travel from SIN-Qingdao on a Boeing 777. Booked ScootBiz seat and it was more like Economy Plus. Ground crew was slow in checking-in it was a near full flight of over 300 passengers and took almost an hour to clear everyone. Allowing 15kgs cabin baggage is a grave mistake as most passengers on this flight brought in at least 2 pieces of baggage each making the clearance extra slow at the screening area. Those who board plane later had no space left for their baggage. Aircrew was not well trained the worst I've encountered in a budget airline. I could hardly understand the announcement in English with a heavy Japanese accent. Announcement in Mandarin was also below standard.,0
2013,My husband and I travelled to Sydney from Singapore on 9th March 2013 and returned from Sydney to Singapore at 16th March 2013. My expectation was pretty limited. We took a neck pillow and warm clothes to overcome the seat discomfort and temperature issue. We didn't hear any annoying call bells (accidentally pressed) either. Cabin crew were good as well. One disappointment might be the food which was not the dish we selected while buying tickets and also it would be too spicy for some people. Overall journey took 40 minutes more than the scheduled time. When coming back to Singapore the flight was delayed 35 minutes. We were fortunate enough to have no luggage issues.,0
2013,Flew Scoot from Gold Coast flight on time but the horrible weather on the Gold Coast was lucky to leave on time. Had Scoot through for our onward flight to Bangkok but the transfer lounge was so far away and the queue took too long that it would have been just as quick to go through Immigration and rebook in. Flight to Bangkok was good and on time. We flew back to the Gold Coast with Scoot and the night time flight was good with a bit of extra space not all seats full and I felt comfortable in my seat. Flight was about 20 mins late. So our experience was good and for the money excellent value for a budget airline.,0
2013,Our initial flight from Bangkok to Singapore was delayed 4 hours. This of course is fine and expected with budget airlines. However we had a connecting flight from Singapore. The staff at Bangkok airport told us that it was ok because the connecting flight would wait for us hence we didn't make any arrangements (eg book a hotel or another flight). However when arriving at Singapore at 2am we were told the flight had left and that we would have to wait until 2am the next morning. We were also told that we had to check in 10 hours before our next flight to guarantee a seat. Ground staff explained if we wanted to we could book another flight and receive a full refund for our Singapore to Sydney leg. Many passengers did and did not receive the refund.,1
2013,We flew from Tokyo to Taipei Taipei to Singapore and finally Singapore to Sydney. Each flight was terrible with each at least 20mins late. The old re-branded 777 planes are falling apart. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. After flying multiple airlines Scoot was by far the worst! Never again. 787 or no 787's the new planes wont fix your poor timing and service.,1
2013,Recently my wife and seven other members of my family flew from Surfers Paradise to Singapore. The plane was late leaving Australia and on arrival we were to get a connecting flight to Thailand. On arrival and with great difficulty we found out that along 45 other passengers were left stranded in Singapore. We found out this happens quite often. The staff did not want to help us or even discuss the matter. The extra expense burdened on us. Never again will my family travel budget airlines.,1
2013,Flew Scoot Sydney to Singapore 2pm flight. Checked in at 12 and told flight was delayed 2 hours. Boards showed flight boarding so went to boarding gate only to be told flight was delayed again - no one knew why. 2 hours later we got to board. Sat on the plane for almost an hour before we took off. My first son flew two weeks later - his flight was delayed by an hour - boarding was chaotic whilst every friend and his brother tried to rush onto the plane irrespective of a zone call. My daughter in law flew in last week Friday. Arrival time was 7pm. Looking online we saw the flight was delayed by 2 hours. We arrived at the airport at 9pm - flight board showed arrival as 9.15pm. At 9.30pm arrival time was changed to 10.22pm! Delayed 3.5 hours! Hugely unimpressed with Scoot.,1
2013,I have flown Scoot with the whole family twice in the past 3 months from Sydney to Singapore and then the reverse. The ground service is poor. Long queues excessively long times to check-in (stood at check-in for 45 mins). On one occasion we arranged for Scoot to have someone assist my non-English speaking cousin to take her through customs and on to the plane. When we got to the airport our assistance had not been assigned. We waited until the queues had vanished from check-in and the counter staff simply ignored us and went on with their other duties. t is impossible to get through to their call centre - they seem to be perpetually experiencing a high volume of calls never mind the time. I've tried calling at around 9pm Sydney time 6am Sydney time and about 2pm Singapore time. Only got through once at the 6am timeslot and only after been put on hold for 45 mins (time by Skype).,1
2013,ScootBiz from Gold Coast to Singapore return. Dedicated lane for business check-in and express lane through immigration at GC all a bonus. Booked the rear seats in business class and found them very comfortable and better than Jetstar business but not as good as Air Asia X business class. Food was not appealing and very basic but for under $500 dollars one way was not complaining. The staff looked very young and were helpful but not of a standard of usual business class but once again its a low cost airline. I enjoyed a nice sleep travelling in both direction and was very refreshed on landing. Food and drink on plane was expensive especially water. Major complaint was after getting on and off plane before everybody else when collecting bags both times my bags were last to appear on carousel. Long wait and then long wait at immigration.,0
2013,BKK-SIN. Service staff very slow in handling check in. No premium lane for immigration and no lounge for biz class. My luggage tag was lost by scoot and needed replacement. Onboard head crew asked what meal I would like told her I had pre-ordered my meals but that menu had changed. However I had paid for the premium meal. I requested for the code for inflight entertainment I tried to press the call button but no crew responded the lights were on for an hour. The food was similar to economy class. Seat was slightly bigger. My luggage came out last as there is no priority for biz class passenger.,1
2013,Flew from Singapore to Sydney on 29/1/13. Check in was slow - one of the ground staff collected our passports and about another 5 people at front of the queue took them back to the counter the person at the counter flipped through the passports put a sticker on the front and then the passports were returned. Yet when our turn came to check in there was no apparent time saving. The check in staff were inappropriately dressed they were indistinguishable from general airport workers. Onboard we had ordered the blanket sets and had to ask 3 times for them although they did apologise when we finally received them. The overhead reading light switches on the arm were very sensitive so that every time you press against the arm the light would come on. The inflight crew were polite and helpful.,1
2013,Last night I received an email saying my flight from GC to Singapore at 9am had been delayed until 2pm. Arrive at check in desk only to be told that it has now been delayed until 6pm and that that's not a guaranteed time. Never mind the 2 onward flights I'm going to have to miss and non refundable accommodation on top - what I want to know is why were customers not emailed on the additional delay? The opportunity to arrange not sitting in this airport would have been welcomed. You forget that many of your flyers are from Brisbane - we can't exactly hop in a cab and go back home. Up until this point I've had a relatively good experience with this airline.,1
2013,Booked to fly from Gold Coast back to Singapore turned up at the airport to be told that flight was delayed. Original flight time was 9.15am and new time was now 6pm in the evening - told that I had received an email which I hadn't neither had the other 20 people who were also there to check in - no apology no vouchers only told to return to the airport at 4pm. I had a connecting flight from Singapore to Frankfurt at 12pm that night and told Scoot staff that I would miss my connecting flight they weren't bothered when I pushed about returning at 4pm the staff member finally admitted that they didn't even know if they flight would go at the proposed time that evening as the plane had to come from China and hadn't left there due to a snowstorm! Had to go to Air Asia and pay for a flight to Kuala Lumpur and then another flight with Tiger to Singapore to get back in time. NOT worth the cheap fare won't be flying with them again.,1
2013,Booked a return flight from BKK to SG. Pre-selected window seat in the red seating of the aircraft. The seats were very thin - ok for a short haul 2 hour flight. The person in front reclined their seat which literally meant I had a headrest in my face. Flight departed on time which was a relief after seeing other reviews. Cabin attendants were far from 'fun vibrant' crew members mentioned in all the airline PR. More like exhausted/frustrated with their job. One snapped at a women when she asked to clarify the pre-ordered sandwich she had just been given. All in all an ok flight. Decided to upgrade to Biz scootz for the return leg just. Very easy to upgrade in SG - 99 SD plus 20SD administration fee. Seats on aircraft cannot and should never be compared to a normal business class product on every other airline. Meal was good. Flight was on time.,1
2013,We flew Scoot Biz from SYD-SIN on 5th of Jan and found it a very comfortable flight. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. I read up beforehand on their website that IFE wasn't available on their IPads so I brought my own so that you can just live stream movies from their system. Seats were wide enough and recline was ok for a sleep with very good head rests the only complaint is there is no space between armrests so it's just like in economy where there isn't enough room for your arm and the person next to yours. Only 1 drink and meal included but the beers were reasonably priced at $4 AU but water was expensive at $3AU. Flight was on time and check in a breeze through the dedicated Biz counter. Boarding was good with a separate biz boarding so we were first. Pilot was down to earth and entertaining. It was definitely the most comfortable flight I've had to Singapore and will travel with Scoot again.,0
2013,We booked tickets from Gold Coast to Bangkok. First flight was 5 hours late meaning we missed our connection in Singapore. Even though we'd booked this as one return flight Scoot considered these to be separate flights therefore the missed connection was our problem not theirs so we had to book a new trip with Tiger to Bangkok as well as losing our prepaid accommodation and having to pay for a night in Singapore. Very little communication or explanation from Scoot no offer of any compensation or even a complimentary bottle of water. Promise of a $30 scoot voucher that never arrived. On our flight home via Singapore from Bangkok our flight was three hours delayed. From Singapore home it was delayed a two hours that turned into about four. My expectations are never very high for a budget flight but no matter how cheap it isn't worth this service.,1
2013,The cabin crew in Scoot BIZ were rather lacking on the outbound SIN-SYD sector and certainly on a long sector like this. On Scoot you have an entitlement and any additional was going to be chargeable - the meal was small in portion. Check-in counter staff was rude at SYD - my check in baggage was overweight by a couple of kgs but my carry on was very light - they wanted to charge a hefty amount for overweight baggage - or else take it out of your check in and carry with you the end result is still the same weight whether I carried it in my hand baggage or check in. On the return leg no blanket provided - apparently only on out bound leg.,1
2013,I was also on the Singapore - Coolangatta flight on the 29 January 2013 in Scootbiz and had to pay $12 for a blanket for my 8 year old. This was my second Scoot flight in 10 days and both have been delayed. On the 21st for 5 hours and the most recent flight - 1.5 hours. I understand Scoot is a budget airline but surely basic customer service should still be part of the overall offer. Unfortunately it seems in the airline industry the more you pay for your ticket the better you are treated as a customer.,1
2013,"Singapore to Gold Coast. Unpleasant check in counter in Singapore. Staff was shouting at the customer ""this is the business class check in counter!"" without checking our tickets when we queue at business check in counter (we have purchased ScootBiz!). Seats hard small (not like Jetstar's business class). Itinerary stated inflight entertainment blanket pillow eye mask food and beverage. After take off nothing was given. When we asked for the blanket and other stuff was told that no longer available. We have to insist these are stated on the itinerary and was only given blanket. When we ask for water was told to pay $3 per bottle. Sent in feedback to customer service with no reply.",1
2013,My partner flew Scoot on the 21/1 OOL-BKK. Flight was 5 hours late so she missed connecting flight in Singapore she was told she would have to wait 22 hours for the next flight. No refund offered no meal voucher no accommodation and no apology offered. She had to buy a ticket from SNG-BKK with Air Asia.,1
2013,Booked flight Singapore-Sydney with seat reservation turned up over 2 hours before departure but flight was overbooked. About 30 people couldn't get on the plane (even though most had paid for their seat reservation). Compensation? Nothing. Nobody from Scoot turned up to announce it or help out (staff of Changi airport were helpful though). On the way back the flight was delayed by over 5 hours. Both flights were unacceptable!,1
2013,Flight from Changi to Sydney now 5 hours late and keeps being shifted backwards. Staff smug and disinterested. Will never fly Scoot again.,1
2013,Pre-booked and paid for inflight entertainment but this service was not available when I asked after boarding. Now I had to find ways to entertain my kid for 7 hours. Instead of giving me a full cash refund for non- provision of service I was offered a $20 voucher valid until July 2013 for 'additional baggage allowance and meal or to upgrade your seats for your future flight'. I have no plans to travel before then and I definitely unlikely to fly Scoot again! Throughout the 7+ hour flight the call buttons were ringing non-stop making any sleep impossible. The call button is placed right beside the armrest and almost everyone accidentally pressed it. Seats were hard and toilets need more regular cleaning.,1
2013,Flew SIN to SYD. The only issue is with the timing of departure being so early in the morning but I compensated with the use of the transit lounge. Early Check-in was a positive. Overall the flight was fine for the price paid meal was adequate and seat recline good for a sleep. For price definitely worth it if you don't mind sacrifices.,0
2013,Over an hour to check-in because we were too early and had to check in at the early counter. Only about a dozen people in front of us but it took an hour to check them in. Of course no lounge but I expected that. Priority boarding was people at the back of the plane board first oh and Business which meant a rush to the queue. The seats relined a little more than most standard seats. I asked to watch a tablet for entertainment and was told they were having technically difficulties and were not available. I since found out they haven't been available for months. Despite leaving at night and arriving in the morning you only get 1 meal and 1 drink. A comfort pack was extra we paid $8 for 1 blanket. We paid an extra $250 for: 1 Meal and 1 drink. Over 70% of the passengers boarded before us which meant the Gold Coast customs line was out onto the tarmac by the time we got off. They had 3 international flights arrive at once as they do most mornings. This airport can barely handle 1 international flight. Our flight arrived at 8.25am and we finally got out of customs around 9.40am.,1
2013,SYD-SIN-SYD in Oct 2012. Surprised that for the fare we paid we received so much. Flights were within 30 minutes of schedule at all times. The seats (Yellow seats $25AUD more) were very good. I am 6ft3 yet I fit very easily and had plenty of room to stretch my legs under the seat in front. Fully aware that there was no IFE so we took our own. Meals were very average but that is not too surprising. Staff were obviously young and inexperienced however they provided all that was required and were always smiling. The price of drinks etc was not too bad. Airport check in at Sydney was quite lengthy but at Singapore was really quick. It is important to remember that it is a low cost carrier.,0
2013,Flew to Gold Coast in mid Dec. Pre-booked and paid for inflight entertainment but this service was 'pulled out due to operational constraint'. Instead of giving us a full cash refund for non-provision of service we were offered a $20 voucher valid until 30 Jun 2013 for 'additional baggage allowance and meal or to upgrade your seats for your future flight'. In response to my request for cash refund I was told to note that the vouchers were transferable. We have no plans to travel before 30 Jun and are definitely unlikely to fly Scoot again!,1
2013,Flew OOL-SIN for the first time on 25 Dec 12. Very pleasantly surprised. Although the flight was full the B777 did give the impression of spaciousness. Pleased that I had paid a little extra for an upgraded seat though. Plenty of legroom - but the armrests are very narrow. No headrests on the seats and the installation of these would be a big plus. The in-flight meals (even the upgraded ones) are no more than snacks - but that was not a big deal. There is of course no IFE. However if you are happy enough to read or use a computer the time passes quite quickly. My only criticism is that the food service was a little chaotic. Other than that Scoot represents excellent value. I'm planning to use Scoot's OOL services in future as a 'launchpad' to the multitude of destinations available from SIN. Very good value for money.,0
2012,Flew SIN-TPE on 21st December the plane cabin actually looked rather old and dated. A panel at the ceiling of the cabin seemed to be loose too. Seats were hard and uncomfortable this was made worse by the lack of a headrest. However the recline of the seat was outstanding. Throughout the 4 hour flight the call buttons were ringing non-stop making any sleep impossible. The call button is placed right beside the armrest so almost everyone accidentally pressed it. Cabin was also rather cold. Toilets are clean and there are drinking fountains outside toilets too. As for service the service crew was very unprofessional they did their work without any smiles and all seemed very cold.,1
2012,Badly organised boarding. Despite having on board water fountains the staff refused to supply a plastic cup without buying outrageously expensive water. Most customers around me were expecting to have to pay for toilet paper. No inflight entertainment available unless booked with purchase of ticket. Staff are friendly but either overworked or under trained. Overall I'll stay away from Budget airlines in the future.,1
2012,Flew OOL-SIN and SIN-TSN return was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the trip. It is a budget airline so you can not expect all the bells and whistles. All aircraft's were fresh and new with a young aircrew to boot. They seemed in good spirits and helpful. Naturally the food service was basic but not too expensive compared to some other budget carriers I have flown with. Surprisingly I was placed in a yellow stretched seat but while the seating did have more leg room the lack of adjustable headrest did not make it too much better. All in all though I would not hesitate to re-book a flight with them. No Inflight entertainment was available but I did not intend of using the pay service anyway.,0
2012,Scoot Business really means Premium Economy with one spicy Asian meal and one drink included no bread roll salt or pepper etc - very basic food indeed. After that there is a charge for everything. Try to carry your own water as its not provided - especially on longer flights. The seats are OK but difficult for sleeping. Our Singapore to Gold Coast flight was delayed an hour before any explanation was given to passengers. The flight eventually departed 1.5 hrs late.,1
2012,"BKK-SIN connecting to SIN-SYD on 28/29 November. As other posters have noted it's definitely worth paying for the extra leg room in the yellow ""Stretch"" seats. However the seats themselves are very narrow (10 abreast in a 777) and are uncomfortable with no head rest. The forward economy cabin was also very cold. I pre-paid for meals but wouldn't do so again. In future I would bring my own food. I also pre-paid for ""Scoot-thru."" - the Scoot transfer facility in Singapore for Scoot-Scoot or Tiger passengers. The advantage of doing this is that it provides a similar connection facility to that of just about any legacy carrier. Not pre- paying this fee means that if I had missed the connecting flight I would have had to pay (according to Scoot terms and conditions) a re-booking fare and the fare differential for the next available flight even if the problem was with Scoot. Paying the ""Scoot-thru"" fee also meant that in Singapore I did not have to claim my bag clear customs and check in again for the connecting flight. Instead I was able to organise my next flight at Scoot's transfer facility within the airside departure level. Service is friendly but the staff don't seem particularly assertive. Overall I found Scoot to be cheap and cheerful and if you're a budget traveller I would recommend.",0
2012,Flew SIN-SYD-SIN. Seats were really comfortable for a budget carrier. If you can book the economy plus (yellow seats). For a bit more you get a lot more leg space. The food and beverage bundle was worth the money. Food was nice and cabin crew was efficient. Hopefully they can size up their fleet so that there will not be any delays.,0
2012,I flew Singapore to Gold Coast return. Flight took off on time the seats were comfortable compared to other budget airlines. FAs were nice and attentive. On the flight back to Singapore we were given a chocolate bar! Would definitely fly Scoot again I hope they will open Singapore-Melbourne route in the future.,0
2012,SIN-OOL-SIN flight TZ006 and TZ005. SIN-OOL check in could have been a lot faster as we were the first few in line. Boarding was slow but smooth. The taxi and takeoff roll were done professionally. Food was served 1.5hrs after takeoff had lasagne which was not too bad its better to pre-order online to prevent long waiting times. For the rest of the flight I slept. Outbound flight ended well with a smooth landing but the immigration at Gold Coast wasn't very fast at all. OOL-SIN a long line at check in followed by another long line at immigration and boarding once on board managed to rest until takeoff. Food served 1.5hrs into the flight and had the lasagne meal which includes pepsi and fruit chips. Landing was fairly smooth. Overall I think Scoot is a fairly reasonable airline if you just want to eat and sleep my advice would be to download movies on a tablet and bring it onboard to past the time.,0
2012,Value for money! Paid for the extra leg room and it was worth the extra. The food was simple. Suggest passengers eat a good meal before boarding and take snacks. Suggest passengers take a warm jumper or rug because it can be a bit cool. Cabin staff were smartly dressed and friendly. Take a book Kindle or other entertainment.,0
2012,SIN-SYD-SIN in Nov 2012. Sat in rows 24 D-G and 25 D-G to and fro. Paid $30 more per seat per person per way. Decent leg room. Satisfied with their service. Served food 4 hours after take off at 2am which was just right. The food was piping hot. The crew were polite efficient and professional. The aircraft was clean and new. The crew will periodically inspect the toilets to ensure cleanliness. Will definitely travel with scoot again. Scoot has full cost carrier service at the price of a budget airline!,0
2012,We had better service with Scoot than on full cost airlines the planes were clean and the cabin staff attentive. Paid extra for yellow seats at rear of plane and would do so again. No complaints whatsoever and we will definitely fly Scoot again.,0
2012,Recently travelled SIN-TPE-SIN. Managed to get the promotional fares on their recently launched new route. Poor legroom and seat space but bearable for a 4hr flight. The Air-conditioning was too cold both ways. Cabin crew was amateurish but efficient. Flight to TPE was full but only 60% on the way back. Overall good value.,0
2012,OOL-IN in Economy having traveled with Scoot on four previous occasions. Boeing 777 is comfortable clean and has enough overhead storage. Economy seat is sufficient and comparable to other low cost carriers. Food was not purchased as I prefer to eat before and after a flight on LCC. Drink prices are reasonable. Staff were very attentive friendly and were on the go for duration of the flight.,0
2012,Travelled from SIN-OOL 2 days ago on a 777 and were not impressed. The seats were very hard and had no head rest! The cabin service was almost non existent and the food was inedible. The water is $4 for a 330ml bottle which is outrageous. The call buttons kept going off all night. However planes are new and clean.,1
2012,Managed to obtain really good priced tickets from SYD to SIN and back. 10 seats across on 772 which is pretty tight. Flight out on time departure and early arrival. Flight back early departure and arrival. OK for daytime flight but on the way back overnight very uncomfortable and impossible to sleep despite paying more for extra legroom seats.,0
2012,SYD-SIN-SYD and would not use Scoot again. Our 7 year old daughter found the seats a great size but my size 8 wife and my average size were very uncomfortable. There were no comforts. No entertainment system without paying no drinks without paying (water was $4) no fold-out head rests no blankets ($12) no pillows ($10) no foot rests the seats were smallest imaginable (they ask you to pay more once on board if you want to move up to the yellow seat). The staff were polite and sweet. The meal we purchased was unappetising. Plane was new and the landings were very smooth so as far as safe flying I cannot complain but the level of comfort was surprisingly low.,1
2012,Singapore-Gold Coast Oct 11th. Departed and arrived 10 min late due to Tech fault. Check in reasonable although strange - check in staff collect passports whilst waiting in check in line and take to document counter for processing then return to pass and direct you to check in counter. This in my opinion slows down check in. Meal service started 1.5hrs after take off pre booked meals served first however they start from row 21 and take a further 1.5hrs to reach seat 61 where I sat - the meal was cold and inedible. Economy blue seats leg room okay however I paid extra for Super seat (well worth the payment). Rows 61-64 are definitely the best - a larger seat and more leg room than other Super seat. Apart from food a good budget airline. Staff extremely professional.,0
2012,"Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney 4-5 October 2012. For a tall person leg space for seating good and comfortable. General in flight service good. Cabin crew friendly. For the ground crew at Bangkok a suggestion - a smile it goes a long way. The ""call"" button in seats in wrong place - easy to push when sleeping.",0
2012,Just did return flights on Scoot from Gold coast to Singapore and it's value for money. No complaint from me and my family. Recommend to anyone looking for value for money.,0
2012,Flew SIN-SYD-SIN in August 2012 with my family (2 adults and 2 children). No complaints and definitely value for money. We did a comparison with their RED competitor for flights on the same sectors on the same days and the difference is mind boggling! Can't say the same thing for the lasagne though which is probably the worst among the good experience we had! Another annoying thing is that the call button will forever be triggered by someone accidentally being located at the armrest.,0
2012,Flew from Singapore to Gold Coast in Scoot Biz. Had flown to Singapore from Brisbane in Premium Economy on Qantas so can make direct comparison. Scoot Biz (SB) was cheaper but seat size leg room meal service and entertainment options were worse if existent. The QF flight had tablet space for 2 drinks between seats SB had normal seat arm as in economy. Leg rest in SB seemed not worth it very little space due to pitch whilst I found meal indelible and nothing before landing or drink on takeoff. Also they made some announcement re streaming then didn't offer IPad. I was ready for sleep anyway. However the info on entertainment choice meant probably wouldn't watch it. In future I would go for Flystretch seats if I used them again after all they actually got to leave aircraft before Seat Biz. Warning in seat power is shared between 2 but use Singapore/UK plugs. Fellow travellers were also low cost travellers.,0
2012,Flew Sydney-Singapore-Sydney in ScootBiz class. Flights were on time cabin staff were pleasant leather seat was OK but a bit hard IFE using an i-pad was OK but had a limited amount of content food was OK but small portions. While I prefer full service airlines Scoot is a Low Cost Carrier as such was pretty good value.,0
2012,Boeing 777 but felt more cramped than an Airbus 320 as the 777 carries more passengers. Service call button and light switch is too close to each other and in a position where a 2.5hr flight from SIN-BKK was nothing but a symphony of calls for service. Flew FlyBagEat. Was informed that my online pre-ordered Eat was not available. I declined offer of another meal and asked for a refund. They got me my pre-ordered meal from Biz Class. My Eat was only served to me 10 minutes before the plane started descent into BKK. I had to struggle with the factory sealed microwave meal it was sealed so tightly I really had to struggle to open it without creating a mess. Good thing I bought a one-way ticket on my inaugural flight with Scoot. My flight back to SIN was on Tiger Airways.,1
2012,Flew Scoot for the first time and had a very enjoyable experience. The seats are actually very comfortable and already well reclined in its up-right state. I didn't feel the need to recline my seat throughout my SIN- SYD trip. There was sufficient legroom and space under the seats to stretch your legs and ample overhead storage space. I didn't miss the entertainment as I brought my own tablet as had most people. That said onboard rental of a fully loaded iPad at $22 seems reasonable to me. While I didn't try all food on offer I did load up on snacks and I like the flexibility of being able to purchase what I wanted when I wanted. The one issue I have is the positioning of the call button on the armrest that often gets accidentally depressed whenever you shift positions in your seat. I'm not a large person but I seemed to set off the pinging each time I shifted. The downside of course is that the stewards/stewardesses may not be as responsive when you actually want to call them. Overall I rate Scoot and my first experience with them highly and think that if they can maintain standards which shouldn't be difficult given their SQ pedigree they will be a success.,0
2012,We flew from Singapore to Sydney in August and had a pleasant flight. Save for the delay in landing due to the Sydney control tower the flight was nice. On the way back from Sydney to Singapore we had a nice trip too. As it is a 400+ passenger 777-200 plane the food served was a bit slow but we had a nice breakfast in Sydney so it was a non issue. There were minor blips like running out of bottled water for sale overall the food selection was nice. More legroom and better choice of food (compared to AirAsiaX). As a point to note we flew KUL-SG-Sydney (using FlyScoot) instead of KUL-Sydney by AirAsiaX. We had time to spare and we have no regrets spending time in Changi before going on FlyScoot to Sydney and back. We will do this again in November 2012.,0
2012,"I was surprisingly pleased with my OOL-SIN flight. I had spent the extra A$24 on a Super Seat and was very pleased with the legroom and recline angle as well as the comfort of the seat padding etc. The lack of headrests still baffles me though and I would hope they do something about this in the future. The crew seem quite inexperienced and do not show the calm and assertive behaviour that I am used to from most airlines yet they are friendly and polite. The scripted announcements with things such as ""Scooting off"" (instead of taking off) add to this feeling: friendly attempting to be fun yet not assertive or what I would consider professional air crew behaviour. The flight was delayed by some 30 minutes. All in all I would not hesitate to fly with Scoot again.",0
2012,Took a long week end to fly from Singapore to Gold Coast. Because my companion is a big guy we took one Super Seat and one standard Seat. Both are aisle seats. Turns out there is not much difference. As we departed at 10.30pm we expected to have a nap within the 7-hour flight. Since the plane adopts a 3-4-3 seating plan the aisles are extremely narrow. Every time the trolley came by the flight attendant shoved my arm and woke me up. The passenger next to me was a tall guy whose elbow kept poking my other arm. Despite this we may still fly them again and low price is the main reason.,0
2012,Flew from Gold Coast to Singapore 4 weeks ago business class. Seats were as hard as a rock the food was shocking and there was supposed to be priority boarding! Never happened. I booked Air Asia Business class for return and they were great. Fully reclining seats and priority boarding. It was worth forfeiting the Scoot return fare.,1
2012,SIN-SYD August 2012 dep. SIN 2.10am arr. SYD 11.40am. The most uncomfortable airline seat I've ever experienced - shallow narrow no headrest no lumbar support small pitch. The food was a very small portion so do not purchase a ticket that includes food. FLY/BAG are the only tickets to consider and bring your own food. Call buttons rang constantly throughout the overnight flight due to their location low on armrests and passengers accidentally activating them when moving in the narrow seats. Never again.,1
2012,We just flew Gold Coast -Singapore - Gold Coast on Scoot Biz and they would have to be the worst seats in the sky. No foot rest extremely thin and uncomfortable. Scoot have missed a golden opportunity to snatch market share from Air Asia who have flat bed seats in Biz. Feedback from other passengers was identical to ours in that they won't fly them again unless seating improves dramatically.,1
2012,SIN-BKK-SIN. Easy to see why Scoot is the preferred LCC for this route. Large B777-200 with 31' pitch vs other LCC's A320 with 29' pitch. However on medium haul flight much prefer Jetstar's A330 which offer same pitch but with head rest and personnel screen on each seats. But will definitely use them again if price is right. Just remember to bring my own pillow as I find the seat hard and uncomfortable without the head rest.,0
2012,Flew ScootBiz BKK to SYD with change of plane in SIN as an experiment to see what this airline is like even though I had other options. For budget airlines the seats were actually quite good food not so bad but the flight attendants were extremely good. Nuisance to have retrieve luggage in SIN and check-in again but SIN excellent airport so not a problem. Had it been BKK or most other airports I would not agree to fly with an airline where one has to retrieve luggage and check in again on the same airline.,0
2012,We flew last week and upgraded to the premium seats with additional legroom. The seats were immediately behind business class with lots of legroom - in front of the wing and therefore quieter. The seats were quite comfortable. The plane had arrived 20 mins late and left 30 mins late - about 15 mins was made up on the flight. The return flight left on time and arrived early. Food was not very exciting airline fare. A welcome change from the usual much more expensive flights.,0
2012,Sydney to Singapore. We had seats 21 DEFG which are the bulk head row seats which we found very good. We had plenty of legroom but bear in mind that the armrest are fixed. Seats on the day flight over were fine coming home on the night flight they were not very comfortable for sleeping quite tight and don't recline far but didn't expect much. The food was awful I wouldn't bother pre-purchasing just bring some snacks. The service was friendly but a little slow. For a LCC I found them really good and for less than half the price really great value. We departed and landed on time had no real issues with anything I would use them again but would certainly aim to get the bulk head row again or at least the super seats - normal seats looked really uncomfortable.,0
2012,Very uncomfortable seats hard narrow and without proper neck support as you find on Jetstar. Though the pitch is okay the placement of the seat supports meant that I felt cramped at the window seat. I emerged off my flights feeling stiff and sore. I missed the moving map as there are no cabin screens. Issues with inadvertent pressing of call buttons mean that they are often ignored by staff even when required. Attendants seemed helpful but difficult to hear and understand over the cabin noise. No online check in and lack of early check at the desk is inconvenient when departing from Changi to Sydney at 2 am as you can't use all Changi's wonderful airside facilities. Much preferred Jetstar.,1
2012,Given their fares are about half that of the cheapest competitors with all possible add-ons I don't think one can really complain about the fees for checked baggage iPads or meals. The food was nothing amazing but the staff were great and helpful. 10-across B777-2 is not exactly comfortable but it is bearable for an 8 hour flight to Australia and definitely worth the price. The iPads are well loaded and easy to use would definitely recommend getting one if you're not going to sleep aboard. All in all given their an LCC and their prices are so low you certainly get a lot for what you paid for.,0
2012,Flight good however the delivery of food service was very poor. Running back and forth with individual food and drink for passengers is such a waste of time. This cannot be difficult to achieve as other budget airlines seem to have a smooth flow of service even at a basic level. Also the quality of product available should be reviewed. Happy to pay a little more. However I will travel Scoot again. With these adjustments more profit and potentially a good product in a competitive market.,0
2012,They are slowly getting their act together. Food not the best but not overly expensive for what you get. No entertainment inflight - suggest you take some but on night flight return really not needed. I paid extra for leg room 31k not the best and by the toilets - not worth the extra. The next 2 rows back would be my pick next time. Will there be a next time yes I would fly Scoot again.,0
2012,Not as good as full service carriers but compared to other budget airlines it is amazing. Nice seats clean aircraft very helpful and friendly flight attendants. Cheaper and better than other budget carriers like Air Asia.,0
2012,"Taking this budget airline was not easy especially when you are seated right at the back of Boeing 777. The cabin crew were quite friendly but the fact that many of them were new they could only answer questions and complaints with ""I'm not very sure"" ""I'll check for you"" and ""sorry"". And it took them to serve food 2 hours after takeoff in which case many passengers at the back were starving. Then it took another 1 hour to serve the drinks and expect the leftovers of what the passengers in the front seats to be served to you. And it was difficult to hear what the stewardesses were announcing to us.",1
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Lombok. Overall a good experience with the flight departing on time and touching down a few minutes ahead of schedule. As with most AirAsia flights, the cabin crew was cheerful and with a better service mind than many full service carriers. The pre-ordered meal was hot and tasty and served shortly after flight take-off. Cockpit announcements were professional and providing all the necessary information required to feel safe.",0
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Kualanamu. I was late and almost missed out on the boarding time. Luckily one of the shopper staff help me contact the AirAsia staff to reopen the gate due to I miss out the gate time before 15 min departure. Fortunately, at the end a member of AirAsia reopen the P5 gate so we do not miss out the flight. Thank you and this is much appreciated for everyone's helping hand.",0
2016,"Chengdu to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Most ridiculous flight I've ever experienced. Flying with two adults, an infant on lap and a two year old child. At airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination, but couldn't print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. Eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us. Will not be flying Air Asia again, am amazed that their policy of two year olds sitting on their own is even legal.",1
2016,"Miri to Kuala Lumpur. I frequently used AirAsia since 2010 until now. You will get what you pay. You cannot expect first class service with the price of a few dollars. I very much like its Nasi Lemak. The ground service is good. For once, I accidently left my wallet under my seat. The flight already departed to another place. Luckily me, the staff found my wallet and keep it for me.",0
2016,"I took the KUL-SUB flight on 02 December 2016. We departed later than scheduled, 25 minutes to be exact. The flight was almost full. There was no pre-departure announcement by the captain. The seat that was bought by me was initially taken up by somebody else as the person wanted to sit in a group. The stewardess was able to settle the dispute amicably. The flight was smooth most of the time. Landing was okay.",0
2016,Surabaya Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. It was a very early flight (5 am). The flight was nearly full as many groups of people performing Umrah were using this service en-route to Jeddah. This contributed to the delay of the flight departure to about 30 minutes. The first food service for pre-booked meals and second for in-flight food sales was done rather quickly but smoothly. The first officer made the pre-departure announcement while the captain made the mid-air announcement. The flight was generally smooth all the way. Landing was good.,0
2016,"After being slightly annoyed that AirAsia rescheduled our departure time to an hour later, they got us to Kuala Lumpur and we made our connection in plenty time. Was made to wait in a massive que when I only had hand luggage to have my ""documents checked"" when I arrived at the desk I was told that I should of gone straight to security, I was far from impressed but the onboard crew were great as per usual!",0
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with AirAsia. A small problem at check in with the wrong seats printed on my boarding pass to what I had originally paid for, but that was easily resolved, the flight was very busy and the ground staff were not the best at dealing with boarding The onboard staff were super.",0
2016,"Phuket to Kuala Lumpur was my first flight with AirAsia. It was also my first experience of an aborted take off, which was annoying at the time but reassuring that the pilot was following the correct protocol and didn't dismiss the warning. After 1 hour and 15 mins, we departed to Kuala Lumpur, flight was short and sweet!",0
2016,"Flew on AK700 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was delayed due to the congestion at Changi Airport, but we arrived at Kuala Lumpur just on schedule. Refreshments were available for purchase at decent price on this short flight. I got a cup noodle for MYR8 which is around US$1.81. Flew on AK713 from Kuala Lumpur back to Singapore. We arrived Singapore 15 mins ahead of schedule. The service of the staff is commendable, and it would be perfect if the legroom can be bigger. Overall, I prefer AirAsia as my first choice to Kuala Lumpur, for its cheap price and reputation of world's best low cost carrier.",0
2016,"Return flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The flight was slightly delayed, should have departed by 7 am as scheduled but departed at 7.34 am. There was mild turbulence during the early part of the flight but later the weather was fine all the way to Jakarta. All announcements (pre-departure, mid-air and before descend) were made by the captain. Landing was good.",0
2016,"Flew from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Boarding was fast, by 8.30 all passengers had boarded. There was no pre-departure announcement by the captain, only mid-air and before descent announcements were made. The 2nd service cart was very slow in the beginning. Flight was generally pleasant all the way. Landing was good. A new food container was used, and I found it easier to use and dispose of. For the first time (for me), the head cabin crew announced on the separation of rubbish between recyclables and non-recyclables, into white and green plastic bags. Congrats, AirAsia.",0
2016,"AirAsia exceeded my expectations on this trip. Both flights were on-time. Boarding was fast and efficient. The aircraft was clean, modern and well-appointed. The flight crew were friendly with attractive uniforms. I had a reserved seat and had pre-booked a meal when I purchased my ticket, which was served to me at my seat. My connecting flight was easy to transfer to and there were no delays. This was my first experience with AirAsia and I will certainly use them again on my next trip to S.E. Asia.",0
2016,"I'm reviewing a booking, not an actual flight: I booked Denpasar - Manila on 15/11/2016, with a 2 hour transit at KL. Some days afterwards I received an e-mail from AirAsia saying the flight from Denpasar / KL was rescheduled leaving me 10 minutes between flights. There were 2 links: One for a telephone number which I called and whose lady said she couldn't help. Another for a chat that was consistently unavailable for 2 days. Also a e-form, which I used twice, but with no answer. The email itself couldn't be answered. After several tries on at least two days and two hours (in total) waiting, I managed to contact the live chat. I found out they would keep my money at least one month, if I'd cancel and ask for a refund. I had to search for alternative flights myself,on AirAsia website while chatting - they didn't help on any regard. In between, the chat was timed-out. So I had to wait again and managed to change the flight to the only option that allowed me to arrive on time at Manila. That forced me to stay overnight at KL. AirAsia didn't offer any compensation for that. I'm still waiting for the next e-ticket, and for the next chapter of this nightmare.",1
2016,On my AirAsia trip from Kuala Lumpur to Busan my plane was delayed due to weather. I had to spend many hours in the airport but it was ok because of the excellent customer service provided by staff. She was extremely helpful and kind. I am very grateful to her for making my long delay much better.,0
2016,"Bangkok to Krabi. Don't bother flying with AirAsia. Sent me a text saying they have changed my flight time. They didn't bother sending an email with any more details to resolve it. When I spoke to their customer services they refused to help - they have a policy that if they have changed the flight time to within 3 hours of the original time they won't offer a refund. Not great when you picked a specific flight time to suit you - i.e. after a tour has finished/leaving enough time to check into the hotel. Means I have to pay for another flight with another airline, I might as well have thrown my money in the bin.",1
2016,"Bali to Bangkok with AirAsia. I don't normally use low cost airlines and this was only my fourth flight on a low cost and I fly at least 12 times each year. All previous flights where on AirAsia and only pretty short so I was a bit scepticle using them for this 4h+ flight. The direct options between Bali and Bangkok are limited to either Thai or AirAsia from what I can see, the AirAsia schedule suited me better so I choose the full package including luggage, Red Carpet Service, preferred seat, food and comfort kit. Check in was quick using the red carpet service which was also fully escorted from check in through security to the lounge. The lounge is old but so is the airport but fine to spend an hour with food and wifi. Boarding through gate 6a was done with priority and included a bus ride on my own as part of the red carpet service. Once onboard seat 1A was fine with enough space, not the most comfortable seat but okay. Crew where young but polite the food was also okay for airline food. Take off right on time with a flight time a little longer at 4h20m so landed a little late. Bags took a little time to arrive once off the flight at DMK. Otherwise a great flight and great service from the ground crew at DPS all for less than 100 which was half the cost of the nearest indirect option with the other direct option costing 3 times more.",0
2016,"Bangkok to Siem Reap return. We chose AirAsia because it was the cheapest option and we were very satisfied. On the return flight we had a connection and we had to change airport and discovered it was very easy. Seats were comfortable, flights were both on time, everything was ok. We shipped one laggage and everything was fine.",0
2016,"Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur. The only flight that would suit me on my date of travel. AirAsia had great check in crew and answered all my queries promptly with professionalism. Boarding was swift abeilt the slight delay. The interior of the cabin looked tired and perhaps a big of a facelift. Seats were showing signs of replacement required. Other than that, all went well. Good flight for this route.",0
2016,"A short shuttle flight between Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Plane was delayed by over 2.5 hours due to planned closure of airspace by the Malaysian authorities. However, this affected my next flight which had to be changed. On board everything seemed good but the interior does need a bit of a facelift. Boarding was chaotic due to delays. An okay flight for this route, I would choose a different airline if it wasnt for it's price.",0
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Yangon. AirAsia is an ok airline when everything is going smooth. If a problem is occurring, they are unable to attend to customers.  I made a booking for a flight and because the credit card interface did not work, I allowed them to debit my bank account for a ticket. The booking number is even mentioned in the bank account statement but they never sent a ticket. As I had to fly for business trip, I was booking the same flight on the same date again and paid with credit card (this time, it worked).  The customer is providing proof of double payment on the same day, is even giving the booking number of the flight where he did not receive a ticket and providing all information needed for a refund. AirAsia is choosing to ignore me. I tried as well on the counter at the airport in KL, they can't do anything. Therefore, I am now choosing to ignore AirAsia - it's a matter of principle.",1
2016,"I have been using AirAsia since around 2010. I previously had no major problem. However, this time I felt really disappointed with their punctuality. The round trip Jakarta to Singapore, each trip was delayed 45 min to 1 hour. In addition of that, before take off and landing, the crew told the passengers that due to traffic on the airport, the aircraft had to wait for another 15 to 30 min. For me, that just could not be more annoying. AirAsia is no longer a budget flight. The price has gone up tremendously. It is often more expensive than Batik Air, the premium brand of the Lion Air group. Unlike Lion, I hardly heard anyone complaining about Batik problems such as delays. With competitors now offering better options and coming up with new promotions, I think AirAsia may start losing its grip. Check-in now has to be self-service and the early passengers can't choose their seats. It is now randomly assigned. Distance between rows is really narrow.",1
2016,"Flight from Denpasar to Perth was delayed due to technical problems resulting in boarding about an hour late. The plane is pushed back for take off and then returns to stand with captain saying there are technical issues. We get off back into terminal and wait for +2 hours before reboarding plane. Whilst in terminal no offer of water or food - in fact passengers that bought water were told they were unable to take back with them onto aircraft. If you wanted water you had to buy. Eventually take off and get to Perth before landing and then waiting for further 30 minutes in aircraft with engines running as ""no ground crew to assist"" and lighting in plane left off so we disembark in the dark. Total of 11 hours for return trip to Perth and ruined what was a great first time trip to Bali. Have never used a budget airline before and will not be doing again. Indonesia AirAsia do not look after customers when there are problems.",1
2016,"Yogyakarta to Kulua Lumpur with AirAsia. There was no pre-departure announcement made by the captain. The flight departed as scheduled and arrived 20 mins ahead of schedule. Flight was smooth except for slight turbulence a few minutes prior to descent. The captain gave 2 announcements, one while cruising and one before descent. Flight was nearly full. Cabin was clean and cabin staff were attentive to passengers' needs. The aircond was working well.",0
2016,"Kulua Lumpur to Yogyakarta with AirAsia. It was a morning flight, and it departed on time. There was no pre-departure announcement from the captain. The cabin was clean and aircon was cold. The flight was nearly full as it was the start of the school holidays here in Malaysia. The flight was generally smooth all the way. We arrived as scheduled. Landing was okay.",0
2016,"Chiang Mai to Singapore via Bangkok. I have no qualms with Air Asia flight. What I want to point out is whether Air Asia's website can be more user-friendly. For example, there is no ""manage my flight"" in the website, Web-check in was another headache. It was so difficult to do so as the website cannot find my flight despite keying in the booking reference number and correct full name! One has to sign in and view one's bookings in order to access the flight. Having succeeded in going to the web-check in page, I had to key in five passengers passports numbers and other details, But lo and behold when all done, I was told session timed out and everything I keyed in was gone. There was no warning whatsoever. I hope my experience is an isolated one. If not, Air Asia management needs to look in to this.",1
2016,"Jakarta to Singapore. Tremendous online website, especially for mobile devices. Booking and paying for a flight has never been more easy. Two days before the flight I received a reminder email including flight and departure/arrival terminal details plus a direct link to the online check in website . Save/print or screenshot the email and thats really all you need. According to the email the departure terminal was number 3, in reality it was terminal 2F. The difference is a 30.000IDR taxi drive that can take up to 30 minutes. This can make the difference between making it in time or being late. Very sloppy from Air Asia as they have greatly invested in a big marketing campaign at terminal 2F itself. Simple mistake, big consequence. Check in was easy, quick and efficient. All the check in desks could be used for all Air Asia flights. Boarding was done by a bus that brought us to an aerobridge which seems an odd thing to do but ok, it works. Boarding was a little late, as was the push back of the aircraft. Jakarta can be a very busy airport but this was not the case for this specific flight. Total delay before take off was about twenty minutes. The aircraft cabin had a pleasant cold temperature and the boarding process was relatively quick, although the aircraft was not full. The aircraft itself felt it needed a big cabin overhaul. Carpet was dirty and the safety card / inflight magazines were sticky and dirty. As we all know, this is a low cost carrier and we all enjoy the low fares. Air Asia's main focus is delivering value for money. But, is it necessary to have a pink, brown and greenish advertisement for a coffee company all over the overhead luggage bins? Service onboard was friendly and all crew spoke good English. I even got a free sandwich and a glass of water as it was included in my added cargo baggage package.  In terms of service it is all you want and need from a low cost carrier and more.",0
2016,"Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur on August 27, slightly delayed due to congestion at night. Onboard found only one FA was friendly and enjoyed her work, and after meal service crew disappear until prior landing announcement. The seat pitch at seat 23E is generous. Choose to fly with AirAsia because their schedule time is convenient compared to others. Broadly this was a good flight.",0
2016,"Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Flew this sector return and used AirAsia as previous experiences have been positive. The airline is moving towards gouging their guests for every penny and placing restrictions which encourage you to buy on-board. I am appalled at their current policy of no outside food or drink on board. In terms of the flight, punctual, clean planes, professional crew. The cabin temperature on KUL - DPS leg was arctic like and almost tropical on the DPS - KUL leg. Legroom is non existent and woe betide you get a kid behind you or a sleepy recliner in front. I enjoyed their no frills approach when it was just that, now they have overstepped the mark. Their only saving grace is the speedier Immigration counters at KLIA2 over the slow ones at KLIA.",1
2016,Kuala Lumpur to Ho Chi Minh City with AirAsia. The flight took off as scheduled as the plane was not full and the crew were able to ready the plane quickly. There was no pre-departure announcement by the captain. The flight was generally smooth. The landing was good.,0
2016,Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur. The plane departed as scheduled. The lead cabin crew's voice was very clear and was giving announcements very clearly. The flight was a bit bumpy at times but the landing was good. The plane arrived 20 mins ahead of scheduled arrival. The cabin crew were attentive and gave lots of smiling faces.,0
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Kuching with AirAsia. It was a good and smooth flight. Took less than the estimated time to arrive at the destination. Cabin crew was attentive and caring. The flight was delayed a bit, but I think that was normal for a domestic flight. Landing at KCH was okay. Overall, it was a good flight.",0
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Siem Reap with AirAsia. Flight left KUL a little later than scheduled but we managed at REP to arrive on time. Departed from KLIA2 and it was bumpy all the way. Got our pre-booked in flight meal which tasted good. Flight was uneventful but pleasant. Crew did the normal low-cost standard service. On the way back to KUL, I pre-booked a merchandise but didn't get it at first. Alerted the crew but he said they have no record of it. Showed my proof of payment but they still can't give it to me. Finally the senior crew did whatever in is ability to get it done for me and I finally got my merchandise. Good effort though",0
2016,"Flew AirAsia from Kolkata to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. As per the itinerary there was 90 minutes to make the connection. The first flight arrived 30 minutes late to Kuala Lumpur so I only had about 30 minutes to run through security and make the 15 minute cut off for my continuing flight. KLIA is a very large airport and I was unable to make the cut off in that short duration to board the connecting flight. AirAsia took that as a no-show and made me pay 74 Singapore dollars as a ""change fee"" to board the next available connecting flight. Terrible on the part of Air Asia for doing this. This was an AirAsia reservation and if they know that 90 minute was insufficient, they should not put it on their website. Secondly, the mistake was not mine. Why did I have to pay 74 dollars?",1
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. I was happy and impressed with AirAsia, the first ever time I am flying Air Asia. The ground service associates was warm and willing to help. The seats were comfortable, enough leg room and very comfortable seat.  The cabin crew are very hospitable and welcoming you all the way. They have been exceptionally professional and willing to listen patiently. The cleanliness of the aircraft is well maintainedl. The value meal I received, was Tandoori Naan wrap which was really tasty. Well Done to AirAsia on ensuring that quality does not suffer although the ticket price is low!",0
2016,I flew with AirAsia from Phonm Penh to Phuket via Bangkok and nothing positive to say about this airline. Seating with minimal leg room and they charge for water. The inside of the aircraft is plastered with advertising for one brand of jeans or another. There is no lumbar support in the seats and for tall people the headrest is in the middle of your back. The extra charges apply to everything and baggage is expensive. By the time you add in all of the extras might as well fly with a full far carrier. I will never fly again.,1
2016,"I flew AirAsia on 21 April from Singapore to Bangkok DMK. I had encountered some problems with my e-ticket which was quickly rectified with a call to AirAsia's office in Thailand without charges which was really appreciated. The plane coming in was delayed which affected our outgoing flight however there was very inadequate updates. This caused some passengers concerned who could be seen approaching the counter staff. The airline could perhaps put updates on the screen at the boarding area just to allay the passengers' concerns. On this occasion, the screen was showing last-call at 9.05pm for a flight that was scheduled to depart 25 mins earlier that evening at 8.40pm. The flight itself was as expected of a budget carrier. The cabin crew who were mainly Thai were polite, gracious and attentive throughout the flight.",0
2016,"Flew Kunming to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. We were lucky to fly on a new plane with new seats. The seats are thinner but supportive and as a result, legroom increased considerably. We are happy with the new seats. The service on board is the usual AirAsia standard, no complaints for a frequent flyer. The only setback was a group of passengers loudly throughout the whole flight, and stewards/stewardess unable to get them to stop.",0
2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Krabi. Despite that AirAsia have the Value Pack consists of baggage allowance and meals for additional price, the website settings require both passengers to take this package and could not be edited to only one of us. It's a short haul flight, full of passengers, but handled well by the ground staff and cabin crew. For those bringing checked-in luggage, use a padlock to avoid any missing items.",0
2016,"Had a flight from Yangon to Siem Reap via Bangkok with AirAsia. Found out at check in that a bag fee 36$ per leg of the trip - 72$ in total for a small bag that I've been able to carry on all other international flights. Our seats had virtually no leg space, it was quite uncomfortable and I am only 5'7"". They only had the option to buy meals and I could not get water or any other drink without paying an additional fee, we asked for water and they smiled and shook their head but they gladly made several trips down the aisle trying to sell teddy bears, perfume, etc.",1

2016,The AirAsia Indonesia flight from Kualanamu to Kuala Lumpur was slightly delayed (20 mins.) as it was late from the previous sector. The first officer welcomed the passengers on board and gave information on the flight prior to departure.

2016,Singapore to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia flight AK718. Used the kiosk to get my boarding pass and went direct to gate. Flight itself delayed 1.15hours due to congestion at the airport thus making us end up sitting inside the plane for the duration of the time. Onboard FA not so friendly and just did the basics but since this was a short flight not a big concern. Overall still a great flight. I choose to fly with them because of the good schedule to select from.,0
2016,Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast with AirAsia as a single parent with two young children (5 & 3). Received the boarding passes which revealed I was sitting across the isle from my children. Tried to have all three of us sitting together. Unfortunately this did not happen and AirAsia staff said this was fine. My recommendation is to pay the extra dollars and allocate your own seating with this airline.,0
2016,"Bangkok to Krabi with AirAsia. Being a budget airline, their luggage allowance isn't great but the leg room was actually the best I'd had on a low cost economy flight. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. Also the cabin crew were friendly and courteous, overall I would recommend.",0
2016,"Flew AirAsia from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau, flight AK6264 and AK6267. Flight was very good and on time departure and arrival. Will fly you safely from Point A to Point B.

AirAsia never disappoint.",0
2016,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was retimed to 2hrs later and the airline informed me less than 24hours before, which was too late to make other arrangements. I tried contacting the airline via live chat and twitter as they don't have a call centre. After hours trying to reach the live chat agent, I was told they could not do anything for me. Then I contacted them via Twitter and they informed me that I can opt for an earlier flight which was 2hrs earlier than my flight and I have to be put on standby at the airport, without any guarantee that I can fly then. I end up flying at 2050hrs instead of the original 1835hrs departure. Arrived at the airport and checked in. The agent informed me that they will compensate the delay by providing meals which was just average. Boarding was quick. The flight was parked at a remote stand, and were transported by a bus. Once onboard, the crew apologised for the delay many times and we very polite. The sale of inflight meals and snacks was done professionally with a wide range of hot meals and snacks at affordable prices. The flight was uneventful and before arrival, the crew bowed and thanked us for flying with them.",0

The pilot did a great job of getting us there on time even though we were late in departing by an hour we reached only 20 minutes late so a great effort. The cabin crew were gossiping at the end of the aircraft but what you pay is what you get so no complaints on that. All in all great value for money.",0
2016,"AirAsia flight was on-time and full to brim. I did pre-booked meals, Nasi Lemak and Satay but not having it onboard. The crew gave me those meals and complimentary mineral waters inside the plastic bag for take away. I always do this because AirAsia foods are excellent airline foods, even better than some full carrier business class meals. JHB based crew were presentable, enjoyed their work and put safety beyond anything. They dimmed the cabin light when most of passengers seems to dozed off on this evening flight. Beware of the last row, seats cannot be reclined! I will ensure to buy the seating whenever flying more than 2 hours.",0
2016,My first experience with AirAsia from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was a splendid and enjoyable one. The flight departed on time and had a soft touchdown at Kuala Lumpur.

2016,Flew three sectors in total with AirAsia. Booked online and checked in online well in advance. We were not seated together but expected to pay a fee to be seated together for two of the sectors. I booked 30 kgs of baggage as there is no free allowance for all three sectors but they only allowed me 20 kgs and wanted extra excess baggage fee. Their scales at KBV registered 5kgs more than the scales at DMG. Seat pitch bad which resulted in bruised knees when the pax in front recline his seat hard. Stewardess stated he had a right to do so but did not how I was feeling. Safety onboard poor with no one seated at the emergency exits as thes are added value seats. Money before safety. Third sector was late departing but no apology. There are cheaper alternatives if you look around. I am a regular flyer and this was possibly one of the worst experiences.,1
2016,"It was a pleasant flying experience with Airasia from Kota Kinabalu to Hangzhou. This was my 4th trip flying with Airasia on this sector. Hangzhou (HGH) is the furthest destination served by Airasia from Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Flight departed slightly behind schedule, the captain made an apology on the delay before the aircraft taxied off. Cabin crew were Sabah based crew. Inflight meal was served soon after the seat belt sign is off and passengers with pre-booked meal are on the priority. Majority of the passengers are originated from mainland China. Cabin crew are patient to answer and assist passengers despite the language barrier. I am impressed with the hospitality and service. The return flight departed on time and a big thank you for the crew on board. Overall flying experience with Airasia is pleasant though there are still room for improvement. I suggest Airasia recruit Chinese speaking crew for flight departing China.",0
2016,"I booked the inauguration flight from Kota Kinabalu to Wuhan on 22 March 2016. Upon boarding, I found out that all crew were non Chinese speaking despite the large number of passengers from China. A big disappointment was that the crew made the safety announcement in Malay. Based on my observation, the crew had communication problems in assisting and handling the requests from passengers from the moment of boarding to arriving at our destination. I have flown a number of airlines in the region and in fact Chinese speaking crew are the norm for routes with high Chinese traffic. Return flight from Wuhan (WUH) to Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Wuhan International Airport is a rather small terminal with two rows of multiple check-in counters adjacent to each other. The check-in process started at 22.00 and was prompt. Boarding was smooth despite a number of flights departed at this time. Boarding was rather efficient without cabin crew greeting passengers as soon as they stepped onboard. Communication breakdown is unavoidable as all cabin crew allocated for this flight were non Chinese speaking crew. Soon after airborne, the cabin crew brought the meal cart out, no pre booked meals were served. About two hours later, I was woken by an announcement from the crew to inform any passenger who found a lost phone to return it to them. Having found no response, the cabin crew had no choice but to permit the passenger who lost her phone to make an announcement. This was not the first time I have experienced this situation. In my previous flight, one of the cabin crew had no choice but to turn to me to assist her to communicate with the passengers.",0
2016,"I bought this Denpasar to Jakarta flight about 8 days before and it only cost me roughly AU$50 which I though was great as it saved me about AU$300 on flying back to London. I was expecting to have a horrible flight but it was very comfortable.

2016,"Phuket to Penang and the flight from Phuket to KL was fine. Get to connecting gate on time and there's no staff there to unlock the waiting area so people are sitting in the corridor on the floor waiting 20 minutes for staff to show up. Staff finally show up and the wait begins. People are expecting to board but we wait. After about 15 minutes I walk up to the gate desk and confirm that the flight is delayed. About ten minutes after this, someone at the desk gets the bright idea of actually proactively communicating this info to the rest of the passengers over the PA. We are given a boarding time of 7:25PM.  I leave and come back at 7:20 and we're still not boarding 10 minutes later. I ask again if the flight is going to be further delayed and I am told that 7:45 is the new time. I began to watch the customer service performance of the lady working the desk and I become amazed at how much basic training in customer service the staff are lacking. She gives no information until people come up and ask what time the flight is leaving. People wouldn't have been getting upset had they just had this basic info communicated to them. This way, people can make arrangements for their pickups from the airport, arrange a late check in etc. Pretty basic stuff. All told, this lady allowed 12 people to get so ticked off that they came up and angrily asked what was going on. She gave them all the same reply she gave to me, but it blew my mind that she never once picked up the PA and told everyone. She wasn't doing anything else really. All told the plane landed in Penang an hour late - not a huge deal but the manner in which this delay was handled was amateur.",1

2016,"Flew with AirAsia from Chennai (Madras) to Kuala Lumpur. Quite a full flight. I'd checked in online and it was a breeze through the baggage drop as most passengers seemed to have decided to check in old skool style. Plane was loaded efficiently and departed on time. With a favourable tail wind and lack of air traffic, we arrived in KUL half an hour early. Unfortunately there was a plane in our parking slot which hadn't departed yet, so lost 15 mins. The seat on the plane was pretty standard Air Asia legroom and recline -  not a great deal. But given the attractive price of my ticket, I'd say it was pretty good value for money. Couldn't really comment on the inflight service as I was asleep for the most part or playing games on my phone. As we seem to have been the first flight of the day arriving, some of the entry doors in the KLIA2 terminal were not opened, further eroding the gains from the early arrival. Quick through immigration and a long wait for baggage to be unloaded - this took about an hour. Also, quick through Customs checks. All in all, a great value product for a short flight where luxuries are not required.",0

Extra luggage, express boarding, dedicated counter for check-in, an inflight meal, etc. For such short flights, which have become so commoditized, I like having choices that are clearly outlined and well priced. Plus the biggest benefit is that when you pay extra for a hot seat, I nearly always have the whole row to myself.",0
2016,"We booked a round trip domestic flight with AirAsia Philippines from Manila to Cebu in February. Our first flight was delayed by 45 minutes at first, then delayed again with no known departure time. Luckily we only had to wait about 30 more minutes before we began boarding. However, the second delay was not reported to flight status sites.  The return flight isn't going much better. It was delayed for an hour and a half already. Fingers crossed it doesn't get delayed a second time.",1
2016,"We flew from Bangkok to Bali and back with AirAsia. The Bangkok segment was a disaster. I booked online and paid for reserved seats (both ways for 2 people) and meals. When we went to the airport the flight representative said that we had to pay for seats to sit together. I explained that I had already done that but she said that I was not in the system. So I had to pay for seats again (and then were still not together). The flight itself was equally poor. Absolutely no legroom and there was no audio or video program for the 4 hour flight. The meal was laughable, we could not work out what was in the bread. The Bali return was much better as the representative was attentive and helpful. He found that we did in fact pay for seats online and offered to put us in the exit row with extra legroom for a minimum cost which we gladly accepted. We were aware enough now to bring our own food, this time so to avoid being served what they call ""food"".",1
2016,"Flying with AirAsia for my first flight Kota Kinabalu to Kuching. The aircraft condition is good as well as comfortable seats. No IFE but it's okay for me seem it just take about an hour flight. The cabin crew are friendly, professional, helpful and provided an efficient services. Flight on time with no delayed. Onboard meals tasted delicious. Ground staff was good just a little bit slow but friendly. Would fly with this company again for future. Great company with great service on board. Well Done.",0
2016,"I've flown Air Asia a lot, so I think it's time I finally gave them a review. I've taken many of the budget airlines in Southeast Asia, but Air Asia remains my favorite. In fact, I think Air Asia may even be better than some of the full carriers in the area. I've flown Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, Singapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai to Singapore, Jakarta to Yogyakarta, and the Singapore/Jakarta route several times. I never had any problems with any of my flights. None of my flights were ever delayed, which definitely can't be said for the other airlines I've taken around Southeast Asia. Their app also works well, but it's only available for use at certain airports. The ground staff is can sometimes seem a bit course, but they are efficient and get the job done. Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead. Overall, i recommend Air Asia whenever you're looking for basic service to get you where you have to go quickly and cheaply.",0
2016,"AirAsia flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 26 January, it was a short, full flight and boarding was quick. Legroom fine and comfortable at seat 23A, crew looks tired and wanted to finish their duty quickly. I did not hear the pilot make any announcement regarding the flight path etc. If it was not the perfect flight schedule selection for this route I would not fly with them tentatively.",0
2016,"I've travelled with AirAsia for years, but this time from Bangkok to Phuket the check-in experience was unorganised. We waited in line for 45 minutes before being told to join the end of another queue. The gates changed minutes before before boarding and of course there was an delay of 1 hour from Bangkok and again when heading back to Bangkok. For our next journey we prefere pay 30 more and enjoy travelling without chaos.",1
2016,"AirAsia from Singapore to Penang. Nothing to complain about - flight was on time, staff were friendly. As with all low-cost airlines, make sure you read the small print, check-in on line, pre-book and pay for your bags and you'll have a smooth cheap flight. I will be flying with them again.",0
2016,"Da Nang to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. Got to check in, after listening to at least five other passengers have a variety of arguments, to start our discussion. The system allocates seats automatically. We are a couple that booked together and the system had us at opposite ends of the plane and the only way to change this is to pay - and surprisingly the only seats available were the most expensive ones. So another $24USD to be paid. This is obviously done to generate another income stream.",1
2016,Flew with AirAsia from Johor Baharu to Bangkok Don Muang Airport. Smooth check in because I had already checked in at Bangkok DMK Airport and printed the boarding pass there because my route on 8 Jan was: DMK-SIN / JHB-DMK. The price of this route was very cheap. Pre-booked meal was vegetarian ginger fried rice and vegetable biryani. For me Vegetable Biryani was not ideal but it was tasty. Arrived early in DMK Airport.,1
2016,"My friend and I decided to go Kuala Lumpur from Singapore for the new year. We paid more the S$200 for a return air ticket for each of us. We were to fly on 31 December to KL and return on 3 Jan 2016 (peak season, off peak the ticket is less than S$50 each way). On 28 December 2015, Airasia wrote to us that our flight on 3 Jan 2016 was cancelled and rescheduled to fly on 5 Jan 2016. When I went online to check, there were agents selling tickets to return on 3 Jan 2106 on AirAsia but the tickets were nearly S$200 one way. I went into the Airasia website to have an online chat. Waited an hour before the operator repeated that the flight was cancelled but I told him there were other agents selling the ticket. He repeated the instructions of the email. I had also bought my hotel accommodations from Airasia and asked if I could cancel the entire trip. The operator could only cancel my flight and my hotel booking cannot be cancelled (my hotel cost more than the flight)! I asked what if I want to come back on the 3 Jan because my friend cannot apply for any leave. I was basically told that was my problem. Left without any real options, I requested a refund for my flights back from KL. My friend bought a new ticket from SQ returning on 2 Jan for less than S$100 and I return on 5 Jan for a ticket that was less than S$50. AirAsia gave us an option to fly back on the 5 Jan 2015 (the ticket cost less than S$50). I asked if I flew back on the 5 Jan 2015 with Airasia, would I receive a refund of the difference. The answer was no.",1
2016,"We got delayed 6 hours from Cebu to Manila. While waiting, passengers were left in the dark for several hours since there was no ground staff in sight, the flight even disappeared from the main schedule board for a very long time. After almost five hours of waiting, a fellow passenger called the airline directly and finally someone showed up at the gate. The ""so called"" AirAsia representative was pretty much worthless in terms of knowing when we would leave. The only way I found out was by visiting the global flight status website which had all correct and updated information! I am aware this is a low cost airline, however, I rather pay more and indeed get some service. Will never use them again.",1
2016,"Flew from Hong Kong to Phuket on AirAsia. My first and last flight with them. A very unplesant experience overall: Long and slow baggage drop-off process, flight delayed, most unconfortable, old and tight seats. Food and beverage only with cash as they accept no credit cards. They don't even give you a glass of water for free. They are cheap, yes, but if you look at what you get, they are actually extremely expensive.",1
2015,"Flew AirAsia flight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur return. Flight was delayed due to the traffic, however, we arrived KL only 10 mins after schedule. Cabin was clean and new, just the legroom was tight. Crew were very helpful and the inflight refreshments were available for sale on this short flight, price was adequate. Overall, I enjoyed this flight. Return flight to Singapore. KLIA 2 Check in counter staff friendly and helpful. Flight was on time, cabin was equipped with leather seat.  The AirAsia crew were very helpful throughout the flight. We arrived in Singapore ahead of schedule. AirAsia is definitely my prefered airline while traveling to KL",0
2015,"Will avoid this airline. Beware of ridiculous checked baggage fees. We tried paying lesser fees online when we were checking in, but the AirAsia website conveniently skipped our baggage options no matter which option we tried to select. Then, at the check in counter, we had to pay $144 for 2 small bags (10 kilos each), even though we tried and tried paying that online ahead of time. When I told the clerk that I couldn't pay online, because I was told that this was my problem and I should have called the customer service. Don't pay for ""hot seats"" - that's another rip off. You get no extra legroom, but you do get extra 15 minutes in a stuffy cabin waiting for everyone else to board, because ""hot seats"" board first. If you want any food - prepay when you are checking in. Otherwise, you won't even get a glass of water out of them. Value for money - not so good. We paid $550 for 2 seats from Siem Reap to Phuket and then an extra $144 for the luggage, so this is not a low coster. Yet, their policies are those of a low coster: pay for printing boarding pass, pay for luggage, etc.",1
2015,"The AirAsia flight we were supposed to board came in 2 hours late because of bad weather. Apart from this delay, we were made to wait another 2+ hours because there was no crew! I can understand the weather delay (although that could have been mitigated by ensuring a longer gap in between the landing time and take off time of a particular flight), but the non-availability of crew is inexcusable! Further, they decided to commence boarding of the next flight before us.",1
2015,"Yangon to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur, and they refused to let me check my luggage all the way through so was forced to spend an hour and a half at KLIA2 queuing. Then when I got to the bag drop, the man said I was too early and if I left my bag they would lose it! I checked this several times and he confirmed 'yes, we will lose it, it won't make it to Sydney'. When I asked why, he said 'because no one will look after it'. So, can't get to the hotel I booked and have had to pay again to use a lounge to escape the noise.",1
2015,"Flew AirAsia from Siem Reap to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. Every flight to get to and from our final destinations were delayed, causing us to miss our connecting flight and having to be put on one 10 hours later, with no offer of hospitality we had to ask for a hotel to get some sleep and the assistant then took 2 hours to actually walk us to this hotel. When it was time to fly, our flight yet again was delayed, and our gates were changed without notification forcing us to run from from one end of the airport to another, the flight attendants were unfriendly and to finish it off our bags were lost.",1
2015,"I flew AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to Senai Airport, Johor Bahru. The cabin was awfully dirty. Somebody spilt rice all over the floor of Row 10, but it wasn't cleaned up at all. My friend who sat on Seat 10F opened his meal tray and absentmindedly put his phone on it, only to find that AirAsia hadn't bothered to wipe the tray either. Although AirAsia is a budget airline, and this was a domestic flight, I still think that this is not acceptable.",1
2015,"This was my first time using ArirAsia, I booked a return flight from Kuala Lumpur - Bangkok. The flight was delayed by an hour on the way to Bangkok but this wasn't really a problem as it was an early morning flight so couldn't check in to my hotel anyways. We boarded the plane and it was clean and staff were welcoming. We arrived at Bangkok a little later then expected. On our return flight we ran into a few problems, upon arriving at the airport in Bangkok the flight was being showed as delayed and when we were checking in the staff informed that the flight was delayed due to a late departure from it origin airport. We sat in the terminal waiting for updates, one hour after we were supposed to depart we were allowed to board the plane and sat down in our allocated seats. The captain announced that the flight was going to be further delayed due to a faulty tire on the plane and it would take around 45-60 minutes to replace the tire. The captain kept us updated throughout the process, after roughly and hour we set off from Bangkok and were quickly in the skies. Thirty minutes into the flight I couldn't help but notice that the engine was making a very loud noise, it was a lot louder than usual. We circled the airport for around about thirty minutes when the captain announced we needed to re land at the airport due to engine problems. We landed back in Bangkok and were escorted to a terminal where we were told to await further instructions, we were given food vouchers while we had to wait and given the means to make calls. After a two hour wait we finally boarded and were on our way to Kuala Lumpur. We landed around five hours later than we were supposed to staff at the customer services were not very helpful and didn't really make and effort to understand passengers complaints. Other than the return flight it wasn't too bad and it was a budget airline after all.",0
2015,"Friendly service, attractive staff, comfortable flight with AirAsia from Manila to Puerto Princesa. Customer service on the phone was helpful, but rigid and inflexible. After having a flight cancelled 2 days beforehand, I was unable to reschedule a flight back from Puerto Princesa for an arrival time to meet my international flight in Manila. As a result, I had to cancel all of my 3 flights back to the US, rebook my flight to Manila at 200% the rate that I originally paid, and then rebook all of my US flights. It was extremely inconvenient and AirAsia provided no leniency. I am fortunate have the finances to cover the extra charges, but it was a terrible experience to go through while on my one vacation for the year. However, online customer service options are ineffective, putting the customer first is obviously not any kind of priority (budget airline) and ability to reason outside of a cut-and-dry system is impossible.",1
2015,"Flew AirAsia on AK702 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was on time and I got to sit the TuneTalk livery jet. Boarding process was smooth, seat was comfortable and the cabin crews were helpful. Refreshments are available for sale at decent price. Even though my flight was completely full, the cabin crews managed to serve every passenger well.",0
2015,"Flew AirAsia, AK715 back home after a day trip in KL. The check-in queues were unexpectedly long although at least the check-in process was fast and I got my boarding pass easily. The flight was on time, seat was comfortable and the cabin was clean. Varity of food and drinks were sold onboard the flight. Overall, I enjoyed this flight experience.",0
2015,"Terrible customer service. AirAsia cancelled my flight at 16 hours notice and offered a replacement on a different day. This obviously meant I had to rebook on a different airline at short notice to get a ticket on the correct day, which cost me a lot of money. Getting a refund is impossible because there is no one to speak to who will offer to help on this issue, even though it seems to be quite common. I keep getting told to send a Tweet or go to an online chat forum which simply never works.",1
2015,"I bought a premium flex ticket KUL-DPS-KUL, due to depart KUL at 1820. The afternoon I was leaving London to get to KUL I received a message advising the flight had been rescheduled to a 1405 departure time! (4hrs 15mins earlier). My flight from London was due to land at 1520 so there was no way I would make it. Because of the time change, I had to call AirAsia in Indonesia and explained the situation. There was a later flight (showing available online) departing at 2020 and asked to be moved on to that. Was put on hold for a long time to be advised they would have to charge me to do that and that I should try at KUL airport to change for free. Upon arrival in KL, the later flight was full and was advised I was rebooked at 1030 the next morning. Also flew DPS-KUL-LGK - had to wait 45 mins for bags to arrive in KL and check in again. Air Asia's online system wouldn't let me do KUL-DPS-KUL-LGK-KUL as 1 booking,  so had to make separate bookings, and the handling agent in DPS couldn't thru check my luggage to LGK. DPS-KUL three passengers upgraded themselves to premium seats and the crew didn't move them back to their original seats. LGK-KUL crew didn't even leave the galley - no service at all - they blamed the turbulence, even when the Captain announced it was a smooth flight. Good value for money but awful customer service.",1
2015,"I booked Premium Flex with AirAsia from CGK to KUL which were the best seats available on this flight and considerably more than Economy. The price includes a meal which I did not particularly want neither did the two people travelling with me. However a meal came with the flight - I was not impressed with the plastic spoon and fork to eat it with or having to pay extra for a cup of tea. Premium Flex promises Priority Check in and Boarding, at Jakarta there was priority check in but not boarding and boarding was the usual mad rush. On return flight there was no priority Check in or priority boarding. As far as I am concerned I was mis-sold these tickets. I tried AirAsia just to see what they were like as I normally use other airlines and I fly very often many thousands of miles but will never use them again.",1
2015,"This is my second flight on AirAsia. Flight from Kuala Lumpur to Banda Aceh (AK423/15NOV) was about 75 minutes and was uneventful.

My next Air Asia flight, I will pay extra for the Emergency Exit seat for comfort.",0
2015,"Flew AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to Bali return. Both flights with a 2 hour delay, on the second one I almost lost my long haul flight, even though I had allowed 4 hours between flights.

2015,"Kuala Lumpur to Krabi and Return The flight was just 1.5 hours long and on time with decent legroom, though I did not book a hot seat, just a regular seat. Overall quite comfortable, clean aircraft and a good flight. The complaint if any is the fact that the lowest baggage allowance you can purchase is 20 kg, it would help if Air Asia gave a 10 kg or 15 kg option as well.",0
2015,"Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur, a lady from third party Hanoi ground staff was rude at check-in. The boarding was chaotic but quick and we departed early and arrived Kuala Lumpur 23mins early. The chief stewardess is good , but I found the other FA is impolite and just want to faster complete their duty only. The seat was cramped with limited leg space for seat 23F, and it was a full flight. With a great surprise flight was lead by a female co-pilot.",1
2015,Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. I use Thai AirAsia frequently but not the Malaysia based AirAsia. Crews as always very smart and polite. Aircraft is always clean with great seat pitch. Food can be purchased onboard although for such a short sector I never bother. My only gripe on this flight was firstly the music which was played when we boarded the plane. I always like some background music when boarding as it is relaxing and also sets a pleasant and tranquil environment but this was pop music and very loud.,0
2015,Check in agent was rude and onboard we found female FA also rude probably due to early morning flight. The Captain kept updating us the fight path announcement. The seat was cramped at seat 22F. The food is hot but portion was too small. They offer do wifi connection onboard this aircraft (chargeable). For the related experience we will not fly AK again.,1
2015,Our flight was cancelled on the morning of the flight. AirAsia failed to let us know despite having our contact details. We had to contact them on an international number at great cost. When we did find out they informed us the next flight we could take was in a weeks time but they couldn't help us with accommodation. They offered us a voucher to be used within 3 months. We live in the UK and have 1 holiday a year so this was of no use. We asked them for a refund but they refused despite the fact they could not transport us in a reasonable time. We had to fly a different airline at extra cost. Staff unhelpful and couldn't care less we were stranded. I'd never use AirAsia again.,1
2015,"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. AirAsia, considering it is a budget airline, were perfectly good. You know what you're getting and pretty much all the time thats what you receive. KLIA Terminal 2 (LCC) is a bit of a let down, it's already showing 'cracks' and it's still very new. Processing through the airport is normally fast and efficient, the shops and restaurants are excellent but once airside the skyways, travelators etc. are poor, depending on which gate you're at the walk can be ridiculously long! Food on board if great value, and if you prebook choice is also excellent, better than some main stream national carriers I've used!",0
2015,My wife and I had to fly them 3 times on a recent trip to Indonesia and wouldn't go near them again. On the first flight even though we booked together and checked in together we found we were sitting in opposite ends of the plane. On the next flight we paid more online so we could sit next to each other only to be told after waiting an hour and a half to check in that we weren't sitting next to each other and to pay another $50. I explained we had already paid for this and showed proof it fell on deaf ears and we still had to pay the extra fee. Our bag was 1.5 kg over weight so they stung us for that. On all 3 flights we could not hear a word they said over the intercom onboard the flights.,1
2015,"I traveled from Bangalore to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur in October this year by AirAsia and AirAsia X.  The booking experience was fine. Had already registered on their website for a domestic flight earlier. While planning my trip researched on Internet and found out they had this sale where Tickets were priced less than half of Others. Without a second thought booked two for me and my wife. While booking came to know that Checked in baggage and meals need a Surcharge. But even then two tickets cost me Rs 70000 for return with 1 checked in baggage and 4 Meals which was Super Value. I had to pay for seat selection with my wife while web checkin or if I wanted extra leg space. The flights arrived and departed on schedule, flights were clean, Flight attendants were properly dressed and spoke English.  Food served was average and I discovered I had to pay more in Indian rupees while pre-booking while it cost less in Malaysian currency inflight. Toilets were clean. AirAsia X flight from KUL to MEL was a widebody jet. There was no entertainment system. Seats were tight for me (6 feet) but my wife (5/6) was alright. Had 7 and 5 hours lay over at KLIA terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur which is fine for Shopping  and Eating and even has a low cost Samasama hotel where we rested for few hours. Overall I got what I paid for. I recommend planning and booking in advance to book in their frequent sales and making most of it.",0
2015,"I had to cancel my original AirAsia flight having just missed my connection through my own fault. The staff at check in did all they could to get me to the gate but I was way too late. The services counter staff were very helpful and I got a replacement ticket for the next day, it cost more of course but the staff were very friendly and offered a number of options, not just the next flight, they also offered advice on accommodation options to returning to Kuala Lumpur for the night which would have worked out cheaper for me had I taken them up on the offer. AirAsia offer a far superior service than some other low cost airlines such as Jetstar.  ( World's Best Low-Cost Airline)",0
2015,"Check in at Surabaya Airport was good and smooth, boarding schedule time 11.55, actually we boarded at 13.00.  Flight attendant was friendly, sales onboard was good. The food very good tasty, I ate Chicken Sauce Philippines Style and Chicken Hainan, but the hainan tasty was not good for me. Orange juice from Pulpy Orange (Coca Cola Product). Baggage Delivery needed long time.",1
2015,Late both legs. About an hour outbound and almost 2 hours inbound. This happens every time I go with AirAsia. What annoyed me was we were told the flight was on-time but only at boarding time were we told the flight would be an hour late. However it seemed to be more like 2 hours.  If you want to do certain routes like Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur there are no feasible alternatives to AirAsia.,1
2015,"KUL-SIN-KUL day return, 2nd time using Air Asia. I don't normally use Low cost airlines however for short trips I find them fine. Web check in for both flights quick and easy I had no baggage so straight through security and immigration. Boarding done by row and I had seat 1A, flight left on time and arrived spot on time. Flight time of 45 min, seat comfortable and was given a water by the young nice crew. Return once again checked in on the web so straight through the efficient Changi immigration and security to gate D37. Boarding fairly orderly although done by row number and again 1A. Flight departed on time but due to poor weather took a little longer, around 1hr 10min. The crew were unable to serve anything due to the turbulence but otherwise flight was fine. If using this airline, pay a little more for a hot seat, it's worth the few . This return trip cost me almost 100% less than the others on this route.",0
2015,"My first time on Air Asia, in terms of value for money you simply cannot better its price and often frequency. Nice clean aircraft, excellent crew, on time and comfortable seats. The pre ordered hot meals are not the best, and often not a lot of western choice, but its ok for a short trip. I honestly don't know how some of the airlines get any economy passengers if Air Asia is on the same route.",0
2015,"AirAsia flew me out of Kathmandu when my airline (China Southern Airlines) let me down. As simple as the booking is and you do get charged for everything etc. I cannot fault the 2 flights I took to KUL or MEL, the staff were friendly and efficient, seats were comfortable.

2015,"I know that it's a budget airline, but it was quite frustrating. Going to Kalibo, the flight was delayed by almost 3 hrs and we were compensated with a banana chocolate loaf and water. Going back to Manila was worse. They moved my flight to 4 hours earlier and if that wasn't annoying enough they actually delayed it on the day. I left Kalibo at 3.20, close to my original flight time but instead of doing my planned activities I had to wait in a crowded airport frustrated. This time no compensation.",1
2015,"I was late for the return flight to Jakarta, but staff let me board at the gate. The Flight is only 1.40 hours, so I don't need IFE or a meal, maybe a free mineral water would add more value to LCC flights. My first LCC flight was not bad, actually very good value for money.",0
2015,"10am morning flight, Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. Overall the flight was okay for this price. The flight was very smooth, nice take off, cruising and landing. Cabin staff service was also surprisingly good. Staff smiled and were friendly and helpful. However, the flight was delayed about 30 minutes on arrival, and the seat pitch was awful, far too - hope this will change in the future. Overall, despite the delay and seat pitch, it was a good experience, cheap price but good quality flight.",0
2015,I flew them on Aug 5 in the evening. The flight was supposed to be at 8pm but it was delayed to 9.45pm without any explanation. Finally we boarded around 10pm and we left 30 minutes later. The only compensation was a tiny piece of banana and chocolate cake and a small bottle of water. The flight was quiet but the seat is very small. Other problem: everybody was sleeping on the flight but they kept the lights on full during the 1.5 hour flight.,1
2015,"This review is for the return trip from Bangkok to Gold Coast via KL. On the way over we flew an overnight flight. It was the coldest flight I have been on. Even with boots, jumper, scarf and our own blanket we were cold. When we arrived at the Gold Coast, the outside air temperature was 16 degrees - that felt warm. Moreover the lights were left on until very late (approx. 2.5 hrs after take off) and turned on very early (approx. 3 hrs before landing). We had very little time for sleeping. In conclusion, it was the most uncomfortable flight we have traveled on. On the return trip, we were notified via email around 3.40 am that the flight was about 3 hour delayed, however we left home at 5am and had not checked our email so we were not aware of the delay. When we arrived at the airport we tried to ask staff to issue us a Boarding pass for the next available connecting flight to Bangkok from KL as we knew we would miss our originally booked flight. However we were told they could not do that but she assured us that Air Asia staff in KL would be able to get us a flight to Bangkok that evening. When we arrived at KL we (and other passengers who missed their connecting flights) were made to wait at the transit desk for around 40 mins before we were notified that all of us had to stay overnight in KL and fly the next day. In the end we gave up realising that nothing could be done, we had no other choice but to fly the following morning. It was about 3 hours before we could leave the airport with other passengers.",1
2015,The flight was very pleasant. I enjoyed it but AirAsia should consider add the in-flight entertainment packages to the flight.,0
2015,"I flew to Kuala Lumpur and back and hated both flights. I'm 6 foot tall, and I usually go in a window seat and I am fine. I was on the aisle seat for both flights and found my legs crammed in. My seat wouldn't recline and found it impossible to find a comfortable position. The plane was too cold, I shivered on the plane and can only be grateful I wasn't allocated a middle or window seat. If you are over 6 feet, 183cm tall, don't expect a pleasant experience. Only good thing was the staff were absolutely fine.",1
2015,"June 2015 I went on a small trip around Asia and I had 5 flights with AirAsia: HK-KL, KL-Jakarta, Jakarta-Singapore, Singapore-Bangkok, Bangkok-Xi'an. Beforehand, I read some reviews about AirAsia online and 99% of them were really bad. Everyone was complaining about delayed/changed flights and poor customer service. After all I read, I expected awful flights but in fact everything went smoothly. All flights were on time (except one - 2 hours delay) and customer service was good. And yes, you have to pay for drinks and food on board but come on, I got 5 flights around Asia for less than 200 altogether. I would fly with AirAsia again!",0
2015,"This was our first AirAsia trip from Perth to Bali. We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters. AirAsia is cheap as chips and very efficient - what's not to like on this easy 3.5  hour run between Perth and Bali.",0
2015,Flew AirAsia from Jakarta to Bali and overall it was a pleasant flight. I've enjoy reading their magazines as a replacement to the IFE - which is understandable as it is a low cost carrier. The flight attendants were nice and the landing was pretty smooth.,0
2015,Air Asia India: Traveled from Delhi to Bangalore on May 23rd. One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.,1
2015,Flew Bangkok to Bali then Bali to Singapore. Planes were clean and new and seats were comfortable but small. I paid extra to book the first row and there was plenty of legroom. The first five rows are reserved for anyone who buys the premium seats (I think it cost about 10 bucks) and they were mostly empty on both flights so I was able to lay down and sleep across the second row. I pre-booked a meal for a few dollars and it was pretty good. Only complaint is they bus you to the plane from the terminal so boarding is a bit hectic. Overall great experience for a budget airline.,0
2015,Round-trip from Goa to Bangalore on 29 April 2015. Later when I heard many bad reviews about Air Asia I was worried. But when I travelled all flights were on time. Crew were polite. Service was good.,0
2015,TRZ-KUL-DPS-JOG and CGK-KUL-MAA. Travelled in the month of November 2014. Booked the tickets few months in advance good deal. All are A320 aircraft's neat and clean. Both ground staff and crew are good in service. Departed / Landed on time. Hope to travel again. Strongly recommend others for travelling in Air Asia.,0
2015,Flew recently from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was delayed 2 hours. Notification when I was already on my way to the airport. Also cheap is something else with all the add ons you end up paying double to the advertised price. Had better experiences with Lionair / Tigerair for flights in Asia. No space in the aircraft and a small water costs 3$.,1
2015,My flight was from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2015 at 11.55am. At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own.,1
2015,Using AirAsia 2 at least twice per month for the last 3 or so years. Majority of the flights were departing on time and many touch down even a few minutes before scheduled arrival With the new KLIA2 facilities AirAsia flights from/to Kuala Lumpur are now so much more enjoyable than before with the carrier operating out of LCCT.,0
2015,"I have flown many flights with Air Asia and Air AsiaX over the past few years. I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations. But always compare ""all in"" is an advertising pitch leaving you to find it.",1
2015,Perth to Denpasar (Bali) on A320. Everything about it was as you expect. Chosen for the exceptional price at the best times of day. Flights left on time/arrived early. Brand new aircraft. Only thing off-putting were the 'threats' about drinking alcohol on the flights and having future bookings cancelled as a consequence but I guess on a route like this they regularly get trouble.,0
2015,AirAsia Philippines: MNL-KBO-MNL. This budget airline surprised me in almost every aspect I can think of. Ground and Cabin Crew were friendly both outbound and inbound flight were on time price was reasonable. Although its unfortunate that they are still stationed at the old manila domestic airport I can say that it doesn't mean the other local airlines using the new airport terminal are better. I can even say that my experience with Air Asia was way more pleasant compared to the others.,0
2015,In January we travelled on four flights in Cambodia-Thailand-Vietnam. Everything about the flights was completely satisfactory and simply no fault could be found. I have no hesitation in recommending them. It's a pity such airlines based in the UK / Europe do not seem to operate at this level. Food and inflight entertainment not used. Only included as one star as the system demands it must be answered.,0
2015,Fly drive Mukdahan - KOP - DMK. Poor service at check in. Bag overweight so had to pay extra. No problem. Went to service desk to pay. Lady started to serve my wife and then dealt with someone at the next window already being served and ignored us. Flight cramped compared to Nok Air. Drive was fine and on time from Mukdahan. Plane to DMK a little late.,1
2015,Travelled first time on Air Asia between Sydney-KL-Penang and Sydney-KL in Business Class. Got a cheap deal as I booked months ahead. Both trips were very pleasant and the female air crew were very pleasant and efficient. Not too sure about the male crew as I only saw them sitting down or eating as their female colleagues worked. The Business Class seats were very comfortable and a pillow and duvet was provided. Food was warm and served at the time you requested. Ground crew in KL kept customers waiting for more than 20 mins as they served 1 customer with issues. Common sense would dictate that this customer be served separately and kept the line moving. Staff were very strict with luggage allowance as I saw many people re-packing at the counters. A good trip and I would fly Air Asia again.,0
2015,CNX-MFM. Kiosk check-in with no bags. Took all of 10 seconds. Flight landed on-time in Macau. Flight left on-time but waited on the tarmac for 20 minutes before take-off with no explanation as to why. Cabin staff friendly and helpful. Would happily fly them again especially ex-CNX!,0
2015,Recently flew from Sydney to KL on Air Asia the flight was pleasant and the staff were friendly. This airline is great value for money and perfect for getting you from point A to B for a fraction of the cost. Inflight entertainment and food is optional yet not necessary. I would recommend upgrading to the quiet zone for a few extra dollars. A number of us also travelled with bikes and other excess luggage the airline was great in taking care of this and we travelled without an issue. I would defiantly recommend and will be returning to Malaysia with them in the future.,0
2015,10/1/15-17/1/15. QZ547 and QZ 544. My husband and I travelled on Air Asia Perth to Denpasar return last week and the flights were fine. The Perth to Denpasar flight left 30 minutes early and as it wasn't a full flight my husband was able to stretch out and have a sleep. The Denpasar to Perth flight was full but once again there were no issues. The flight attendants did their jobs competently. I would definitely recommend Air Asia for short trips.,0
2015,Flew the KUL-CGK on 20 December and CGK-KUL on 4th January. On the sector KUL-CGK the food that I pre-booked was delicious served hot nice and creamy. On the sector CGK-KUL food was served hot and it was awesome. Overall good trip satisfaction. FA's were nice and presented a good service throughout the flight. Will continue to fly AirAsia.,0
2015,As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. Never again.,1
2015,Kuching to Penang. Flight was scheduled at 7.55pm but was delayed to 8.30pm most likely due to bad weather. Boarding was fast seat was extremely narrow and I was rather shocked about it as only recently I flew with MAS. Flight was very bumpy but this is most probably due to weather. Food was rather tasteless and is not worth the price. The ticket price wasn't very cheap either only about RM20 cheaper than MAS. I would have opted for MAS if MAS has direct flight between these two cities.,0
2015,KUL-HKT-KUL. I accept that if you don't pay to choose a seat it will be selected randomly. But to split people up on the same booking (my wife was in the row behind me) is ridiculous. Outward flight 15 minutes late (it appeared that someone's bag was being offloaded so maybe someone failed to board the flight) before arriving into the chaos of Phuket airport arrivals (I reviewed this airport separately).,1
2015,I flew Air Asia in July from Bengaluru to Chennai 4 times onward and return as well. The fares were excellent and the planes neat and clean. The price is the Company's UPS which is helping them do well in Malaysia Indonesia and other Asian countries where they fly. The only thing which I did not like was issuing Paper Boarding passes instead of the regular passes. But I heard they have changed this and are now issuing the normal passes. Would surely fly again.,0
2014,Just flew four sectors with AirAsia and couldn't fault except for limited menu options at the end of the flight from Sydney to KL. Only complaint would be about their partner optiontown. I paid for an upgrade and booking fee for 2 via their website about 2 months prior to our flight. About 4 hours before the flight I received an email saying our flight upgrade was unsuccessful. We got on the plane to an announcement that there were upgrades available to business class for almost double what we originally paid - 4 in fact. We feel ripped off. I do not accept their were 4 business class cancellations. Either Air Asia or their partner Optiontown are guilty of charging our booking fee for no service.,0
2014,Flew with them this week between Bangalore Chandigarh and back to Bangalore. I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. Where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. No smoking announcement not made. Some positives though. Good pricing strategy. Fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve.,1
2014,Took the KUL-CGK-KUL on AK386 and QZ202 respectively. Cabin crew were awesome and very good. Food was ok but could add more menus and add more spices to the food.,0
2014,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.,1
2014,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies  no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.,1
2014,Bangkok DMK to Siem Reap Cambodia on 24 November. First time on Air Asia. A320 arrived late but plane was turned around quicker than normal. Gate agents never said anything about the delay which I hate - just say the flight is late. We departed 20 minutes late and arrived in Siem Reap about 10 minutes late. Short 50 minute flight. Plenty of leg room (I'm 175 cm) and had a seat in the middle open so plenty of room. Flight attendants very friendly. Didn't eat or drink but snacks looked reasonably priced. Luggage was off quickly - immigration took forever but that isn't Air Asia's fault. Very nice airline and flew a couple days later again.,0
2014,"Siem Reap Cambodia - KUL on 27 November. Check in was quick - my bag was over the 20 kg limit so they let me re- pack and carry on a 2nd carry-on the signs all over say ""only 1 carry-on allowed"" but I never saw anyone say anything to customers with multiple carry-on bags. Agents were friendly both on the ground and in the air. Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing. Think its a standard of Air Asia to not announce delays promptly. Flight was good - 2 hours and again a seat in the middle free. Bought noodles and snacks - good value for money and delicious. Landed at KUL Terminal 2 about 45 minutes late and bags came out fairly quickly. Enjoyed the flight and definitely a good fare.",0
2014,We were a group of five who took CGK - DMK - CGK flight (QZ 252 and QZ 255) both stints were pretty much on time efficient check in process at both airports. As expected we were seated at distant rows which was alright for us. Overall very satisfactory.,0
2014,AK384 KUL-CGK / BDO-KUL. Both flight departed on time and arrived a few minutes earlier than scheduled. Cabin crew for KUL-CGK - seemed friendlier and approachable. Luggage drop were fast as I did web check in.,0
2014,My family and I (group of 5) flew PNH-KLIA2-PNH in November 2014. The PNH-KLIA2 flight was almost full and the KLIA2-PNH flight was completely full. Having been a regular AA and AAX flyer since 2006 we knew what to expect - value for money. Our expectations were kept at a reasonable level and once again we were not disappointed. Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude. A few ground staff at the old LCCT had a poor command of English. On balance though in my 8 years of flying on AA and AAX I have found AA and AAX to be good to excellent.,0
2014,"12th Nov 2014. Flight: AK139 Hong Kong (1050 dep) to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2). This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced and I would pre-book meals with them in future. As for ""Inflight Entertainment"" that is non-existent as would be expected.",0
2014,I frequently fly Air Asia and like the cleanliness and modern aircraft. This flight was Perth to Kuala Lumpur. The seat business class seating is okay and almost lie flat enabling a couple of hours sleep on the flight. The airline policy for quiet areas at the front on the plane is very good.,0
2014,We flew from KLIA2 to Bangkok Don Muang return at the end of October. I bought the tickets during a promo sale so paid very little. All went well. Flights were on time. It was a holiday weekend on the way out so the flight was full. Coming back things were less hectic as it was a normal weekday. I chose a lunch time flight so we could use a taxi to the airport easily. Check in was quick and the flight went on time. The pre-booked meals were all as expected. Seats were free up the back and we were allowed to use them and spread out. Arrival at KLIA2 was easy as we'd used the airport before. Air Asia offers a great product. You know what you'll get and so long as you buy during a promo period you'll pay very little.,0
2014,Business class to and from Australia was well up to expectations. Flights on time comfortable seating clean and modern aircraft edible food polite helpful and welcoming crew. Likewise the 3 internal Malaysian flights in a single-class aircraft.,0
2014,Business class was wonderful except for the meals and any drinks had to be brought including water. The inflight entertainment was limited and if you didn't book it with your flight you could not request it once you got to the plane as they only allow enough for the pre booked entertainment. The seating and value for money was wonderful and the 8 hour flight went very quickly. I would recommend that you eat well before going on the flight and you will be very happy with everything else.,0
2014,"Comfortable business class ""flatbeds"" on longer legs of trip - service good - usually depart and arrive on time. Staff usually very friendly and accommodating but this last trip (Sydney/KUL/CNX) staff were a bit on the reserved side. This is unusual even with the short flights I have taken with Air Asia as well as some other business class flights. My rating for inflight entertainment was 3 out of 5 because one needs to purchase the entertainment separately and I did not use it as I was travelling overnight. Generally and for the most part I would recommend flying Air Asia.",0
2014,Over the past month I have flown Domestically several times in Thailand and last week flew Business Class to Australia. I will return to Thailand the same way. I am an Australian but have lived in Asia for the past 22 years. Air Asia has grown and improved remarkably over the past few month. The crew service food cleanliness of the planes are all now far superior than in the past. It is a low cost carrier but now it doesn't feel so much that way.,0
2014,20th Apr 2014 Perth-Kuala Lumpur flight D7233. 18th Oct 2014 Kuala Lumpur-Perth flight D232 in Business Class. Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline but the seat does all the work thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class. Aircraft clean and crew very helpful.,0
2014,D7206 24 October 2014. This was our first Business Class flight experience with Air Asia and it exceeded all our expectations. Because it is a No Frills Airline we were not expecting a full service. We made our meal selection at the time of booking. We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment. The seats however are as good as you would hope to find in any full service business class. Fully lie flat and with the full size pillow and duvet supplied we enjoyed a good sleep for almost the entire flight. Would I chose this again? Absolutely!,0
2014,AK827 on 23/9 from Phuket to KL then KL to Sydney on 23/9 Flight D722. Return was on D223 Sydney to KL on 7/10 then same date KL to Phuket on AK222. I booked well in advance for a trip to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur and am a frequent flyer with Aisr Asia so am aware of the restrictions for the excellent price and service which is provided. I would have liked to have been informed that there was no Business Class Lounge at Kuala Lumpur airport and also it would have helped if they had given us some idea of the great distance between Gates. I cannot fault their service at the desks through the Gates and on the aircraft. Business Class is extremely comfortable and with the exception of the food and beverage arrangement which I was aware of very good.,0
2014,5 October 2014 FD315 and D7 222. I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats. I will definitely fly AirAsia business class for an overnight flight again as long as it is affordable for me.,0
2014,My wife and I flew from Sydney to Kuala Lumpar and then on to Phuket with Air Asia in business class albeit the KL to Phuket sector did not have any business class - which we had been warned about prior to the trip so this was no surprise. We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer. As far as value for money goes I could not have wished for a better experience. We will certainly use this airline again where possible.,0
2014,We flew PEN-DMK by FD402. The flight departed and arrived on time. Boarding in Penang smooth and efficient as was the arrival in Bangkok. The cabins are fresh and clean. Crew is efficient and accommodating. So when the fares are reasonable I see no reason not to give AirAsia top marks. It helps that DMK although it looks a bit outdated is more efficient than BKK by far. On a sidenote the question on inflight entertainment is not relevant on a 2 hours flight but the inflight magazine is good so high score here.,0
2014,AirAsia Philippines is the worst airline I have ever flown with we were flying from Cebu to Manila and back. The boarding process was a disaster with everybody wanting to go in at the same time and nobody tried to even control the flow of passengers. At check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26. For a fee they could change seats - this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row. The person who checked us in acted as if he was tired and doing all he could.,1
2014,Travelled KCH-KUL with AirAsia and KUL-ICN with AirAsiaX (Fly-thru). Happy with their efficient and no-nonsense service. Baggage went all the way from KCH to ICN. Flight departed on time (as with most other flights I have taken with AirAsia). In-flight magazine was quite an interesting and informative read. Pleased with the courtesy of the crew. Also the Captain greeted disembarking passengers which is excellent.,0
2014,"We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again.",1
2014,Out of the 9 Air Asia flights I took in May and June 2014 5 of those flights were late by more than 40 mins. Another bug I have with Air Asia is that they do not notify passengers of flight changes dates etc. They simply change itineraries and let passengers find out themselves. I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore. Scoot are far more reliable and a similar price ex Sydney. Once my pre-booked flights for 2015 are used it's bye bye to Air Asia for me. Too little too late! 50% good is not good enough!,1
2014,Having flown many times with AirAsia we are really amused by some of the critical comments about this airline. Having flown dozens of times in SE Asia and might we add that we always fly Business Class for our long haul with another airline we find Air Asia short flights excellent. If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin. They are punctual good value food wed upgrade our luggage and seat when you book and crew are always pleasant. Petty comments about no entertainment on a 1 or 2 hour flight takes some beating. As with Ryanair follow their rules and you will have no problems.,0
2014,Our very first experience with AirAsia and we are totally pleased. Our family of 8 flew from Johor Bahru - KL so a quick flight. Check-in was smooth however we arrived early and it was quite sometime before the check-in counter opened. The waiting area at Johor Bahru is just adequate. However the flight itself was smooth and efficient getting us to KL on time. As it was such a quick flight there was no time for inflight entertainment or food & beverages. I would highly recommend AirAsia. Value for money was excellent.,0
2014,Delayed for almost 20 hours without food water and accommodation in Kansai airport. It was a midnight flight. No announcements to update status until 3 hours after departure time. Handled the exit and collection of luggage in a messy manner. Worst airline that io have ever taken. Unprofessional and doesn't care about passengers. Only having profit in mind. Didn't even care for passenger carrying sleeping child. They have to queue in a messy manner to collect departure card from AirAsia ground crew.,1
2014,Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.,1
2014,Having returned from a 3 week trip around SE Asia flying 6 legs with Air Asia I have to recommend their service aircraft ground staff cabin crew and pricing. We had the pleasure of flying Air Asia out of KL and Thai Air Asia out of Bangkok HCMC and Phisanulok. On all occasions check in was quick and efficient with clear direction given boarding spoken in English seat allocation and comfort fine with ample space for the short haul flights FA's were well presented with good command of English flights all left on time food and beverage acceptable with good pricing compared to other budget airlines no IFE but most people talked to their partner the old fashion way of communication which made the flight seem short. Overall my wife and myself were very pleased we chose Air Asia to travel around SE Asia and would have no hesitation in booking to fly with them again.,0
2014,Praya/Lombok to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2) as a HiFlyer. I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.,0
2014,AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing. AirAsia is ok for the price will consider using them again for flights to and from Malaysia.,0
2014,Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off.,1
2014,I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. The flight was cancelled after we had boarded. We had to queue for hours for various things. Air Asia did the bare minimum to help.,1
2014,Flew Sydney-Kuala Lumpur-Bangkok on July 28 2014. The flight was on a budget fare but was on-time at all stops. Food on board had to purchased but quite reasonable. Customs clearance at Bangkok Don Mueang was also efficient. On the return journey in August my wallet was stolen at Don Mueang and Airasia held the plane for 20 minutes while their staff assisted with a search. As my wallet was not located I was without cash when I arrived at Kuala Lumpur. I was very impressed when one of their staff gave me 20 ringgits so I could purchase a meal. Most impressive.,0
2014,Flew from MNL-Cebu. One hour flight without problems in a new plane and plenty of legroom.,0
2014,Flew Air Asia India from Bangalore to Chennai. Check-in smooth and efficient. Boarding completed before time and pushback 10 minutes ahead of schedule. New and clean aircraft manned by an efficient cockpit and cabin crew. Landed in Chennai 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Looking forward to them expanding to more destinations within India.,0
2014,"Premium/Business class in the month of August KL - Seoul Busan - KL. Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage. It is not that exclusive anyway economy class passenger can just walk pass you anytime anyhow.",1
2014,I was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible! Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.,1
2014,We flew Kuala Lumpur to Singapore on 1 August 2014. Total cost was 927MYR (171 or just 329 each). We were astounded at the high quality of the flight the cleanliness of the aircraft and the friendliness and professionalism of the crew. Having paid a very low price (to us in England) we were expecting a below-Ryanair experience but this was anything but. Proper seats seat back pockets a wide range of snacks- this was far higher standard than Finnair offered on their Manchester-Helsinki flights. Will not hesitate to use AirAsia again.,0
2014,Low cost flight low cost quality. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Then from Melbourne to Singapore in April 2014. The second flight was cancelled at the last minute so obliged to take midnight flight. Hours standing in a queue to check in luggage. Seats narrow and uncomfortable. No entertainment. Food and drink expensive with little choice.,1
2014,I flew DMK (Don Muang) - SIN (Changi) many months ago. Very good Low-Cost Airline. Recommend for the Low-Cost Ticket.,0
2014,Flew lately with them from KUL to PEN and I loved the airline. I also pre-ordered their in-flight meal service which was delicious and promptly delivered once on board. On return flight the flight was delayed by 2 hrs. but I needed to be back in KUL on time so I booked another airline on my way back to KUL. Later I exchanged a few e- mails with their station manager in PEN so they handled my delay costs very professionally. All in all not a bad airline to fly with around Asia. Only negative side is that they use low-cost terminal at KUL which you can not compare with a satellite Terminal.,0
2014,My 17 year old son and I were on a 43 day round the world holiday. While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia 29 June 2014 QZ266 CGK-SIN. The whole trip is good. Staff were friendly. The seat was small with little leg room. The Inflight Entertainment isn't very nice.,0
2014,Flew Air Asia in June 2014 from Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. The Surat Thani airport is very small you go down an escalator and walk onto the tarmac to board the plane. The plane boarded on-time and very quickly. The flight staff were still vacuuming when I boarded! They boarded the plane quickly and had an easy departure and easy landing. The distance between seats is really small. I am not a big person but these seats are very close! They do recline but not much. Not very comfortable for a long flight but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though. I paid extra for a seat assignment one piece of luggage and a chicken dinner. Total came to around $2600 Bhat which is about $80 USD. For a short flight it was fine although the seats are not very comfortable.,1
2014,My 17 year old son and I were on a 43 day round the world holiday. While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia cancelled 2 of our segments and replaced them with another 2. The first was only an hour delay so no big deal. However the second one put us into SGN too late to make our connecting flight on to DAD. As soon as we landed in BKK I went to the Air Asia help desk and explained my problem. BTW This is a Thai Air Asia flight. The 2 young staff members couldn't have helped me more. They understood my problem and did a great job fixing it. I've flown them several times and they're a first class low fare carrier. When they charge you for food and drinks on board it's at a reasonable amount. They now only operate out of Don Muang (DMK) but there is a free shuttle between DMK and BKK airport. Great airline great crew in the air and on the ground.,0
2014,June 7 2014 AK6110 KLIA2 - Penang. Boarding was ok although I didn't hear a call. The seat was small little leg room. It is ok for the short flight.,0
2014,PER-DPS-PER. Positives were cost clean aircraft and a good selection of flight times. However I was concerned with the level of hygiene in the toilets. On both flights soap was not provided which essentially means that nobody was able to wash their hands properly which is poor infection control particularly when there are 180 people confined to a small space for a long period of time. Flight attendants and crew could be more clearer on the PA system as well. Food good but a lot cheaper if pre ordered.,0
2014,BKK-HDY-BKK return. Observed significant improvement from cabin crew they seemed to be smiling and really welcomed you on board these flights. Decided to bypass hassle at check-in counter by internet check in pre- printed boarding pass and not loading luggage which is a good decision. The journey become very uneventful compare to the past experience. Aircraft new and clean as usual. Only criticism for buy on board food (evening flight) which all hot food completely sold out what left of sandwiches choices are badly stale.,0
2014,KUL-MNL-KUL. The airport where Air Asia international flights depart is supposed to be a domestic airport. My flight was at 4.20pm. I arrived at the airport around 1.30pm. Past 2pm they were not still letting us in. The waiting area and check in area is still serving the earlier flight to Korea. They just have 2 check in counters and 2 immigration counters of a supposed to be international terminal. I am from the Philippines and I feel for the foreigners who were with me on this terminal. I hope Air Asia can transfer all of their international flights to Terminal 3. Will take Air Asia to Manila once they transfer.,1
2014,"DMK-PHN-DMK via FD 606 and 607 respectively. Flight was on time with a couple minutes late. Both flight was close to full as it was holiday week in Cambodia. Once again nothing much to complain or pride. Except I noticed the quality of ground crew and flight attendant going downward. Unfriendly and very unapproachable. I know this is a low-fare airline however given the price paid for at least a smile or ""welcome aboard"" is shown to the customers.",0
2014,LOP-KUL 17 May. I checked in online and got the boarding pass. Since I had no checked-in baggage I went straight to the immigration counter which was very convenient and save a lot of time. The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. Luckily the ground staff provided us with a simple meal. The flight was not full. I had the whole row to myself so that I could lie down during the entire flight. Of course the flight arrived late. The FA was ok. The seat pitch is a little bit short for me. I didnt order any on-board meal as I just had dinner prior to the flight.,0
2014,PER-KUL-HND in April with my 2 year old son. The flights were fine on time and pleasant for the fare paid. However two weeks ago received an email from Air Asia stating that my return KUL-PER flight 26 May has been cancelled - 'for commercial reasons'. Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'. Service recover for whom? Formerly loyal Air Asia customers. No longer.,1
2014,SIN-DPS / DPS-SIN Travelled with my parents last week and had booked wheelchair assistance both ways for our trip. At check in at Changi this was confirmed and my dad was well taken care of right up till he was seated. Cabin crew professional organised and polite. Seat comfort was ok legroom is tight but that was expected. Departure and arrival were both almost 40 mins late. Wheelchair was waiting after deplaning via stairs at Bali. (I did wonder how we would have managed getting my dad down had he not been able to use the stairs..) Fortunately he did and he was met by a friendly ground staff who took him all the way through. Bags were out quickly. Return from bali was equally efficiently handled. No problems with the wheel chair request and early boarding. All in all very impressed with Air Asia's professionalism and well run operation.,0
2014,Travelled with family on KL-Chiang Mai and thoroughly enjoyed the smooth and on-time flights. The pre-booked meals were ok and the crews service was well above average to my surprise. Entertainment - not applicable.,0
2014,Return flight from Bangkok to Udon Thanni. The four members of staff at boarding gate were either sleeping or playing with their phones. None took any interest in the customers despite the flight boarding time coming and going with no announcements. On the return flight 5 days later the cabin crew failed to notice 3 extremely drunk passengers who I guess were automatically allocated online emergency exit seats! When I told the cabin crew about this they asked them to move and one of the crew later thanks me. I sat in one of the emergency exit seats and was given no extra information which was unusual as every time prior when seated on such seats the staff took the trouble to make sure I was familiar with how to open the door in the very unlikely event of an emergency.,1
2014,I flew from Darwin to Bali on 21 April and from Bali to Darwin on 25 April. That was our first time trying Air Asia and we will not try again. On both days Air Asia was delayed for about 2 hour. There would have been no time to have the crew check the plane before it departed again.,1
2014,"7th May from Jakarta to Denpasar Bali. Flight QZ7532. Every single time I flew AA the flight was delayed. They usually use a random excuse like ""delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft"". This time 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA I thought that was extremely bad. They can't care less about their passengers.",1
2014,Had the worst travelling experience travelling to and from Sydney to Phuket via KL. Hated every minute of it. Appalling service from the minute of check in both ends. Do not waste your time nor paper checking in beforehand. Do not buy food on board (maybe chips would be ok). Will never recommend nor use again.,1
2014,"Yesterday I flew from Thailand to Malaysia. Air Asia charges extra for every possible option. I booked a ""hot seat"" which should have priority boarding. No priority was ever offered and I was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. I also pre-booked food. I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing. The floor of the plane had bits of trash all about. The worst flight I have ever been on.",1
2014,Flew with Thai Air Asia from Yangon via Bangkok to Siem Reap and from Saigon via Bangkok back to Yangon. The only major problem was when we had to check in a bag (15kg) in Saigon for a whopping US$72. It was more than I paid for my ticket. Service not bad planes are clean and FAs are friendly. Bought food for US$6 - extremely small portion and not worth it.,0
2014,Chiang Mai to Krabi. This is by no means a budget carrier due to their increasing prices. They were the only carrier to offer a direct flight less than two hours (avoiding BKK) but at a cost of almost 300 one way for two people. Thai Bangkok and Nokair all stopped at Bangkok. Nothing given for free on board no entertainment. You got to pay for luggage and I couldn't fathom out how not to pay for their insurance! Better and cheaper fares offered with main airline carriers. Although the flight was straightforward.,1
2014,Air Asia at first glance looks like a great deal but beware! As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic! There were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it never mind the danger to the children! In-flight entertainment? None. Spend the extra and fly a real airline.,1
2014,Air Asia Indonesia: Recently travelled from Perth to Bali and Bali to Darwin with Air Asia Indonesia. The airline and staff were fantastic from check in to baggage collection. Can't recommend highly enough. Paid for the Red Carpet option in Bali and this was well worth the $30.00 dollars. The lounge was great as was the complimentary food and drink. We flew with Qantas from Melbourne to Perth and compared to Air Asia they were sadly lacking.,0
2014,Flown from CCU-KUL (LCCT) and back. Comfortable flight. As with any low cost carrier you could buy food and drinks on board. The flight attendants were nice and friendly. Only down side was lack of inflight entertainment and poor leg room.,0
2014,The worst airline in the world in terms of customer service. I booked a series of flights 8 months in advance. Air Asia moved one of the flights causing a connection to be not possible. Air Asia then refused to allow me to move the flights to fix the connection conflict they caused and refused to give me a refund. I wonder what happens if I take the flights and get stranded when one flight lands after the connection has already taken off?,1
2014,"We flew FD2603 DMK-CSX on 16/09/14 and returned by FD FD2604 on 19/03/14. The DMK-CSX boarding was delayed because staff were not at the gate at departure time. We were informed that they had been busy with another gate and thus no staff were available for our gate. The boarding thus became messy although we managed to get through because of our priority boarding seat privilege. On the return flight our group consisted of 13 persons with 4 booking codes. We were told to check-in as a group and we were the first group to check in at the counter. Our queue however was overtaken by another tour group. We had to ""protest"" in order to have our queue maintained. Check-in was slow and rather inefficient and we were informed that it is because the staff are new. BTW the inflight services are OK on both legs. Web-ordered meals were reasonable. Finally when we arrived at DMK three of our luggage had lost the luggage tags. Fortunately there was not much baggage and we could identify them. But imagine if this were a connecting flight or several pieces of baggage was involved?",0
2014,KUL-SIN-KUL. Return flight to Singapore for a day trip. $40 return so cant complain about the price. No issues with check in on both legs. Fairly new A320s which for some reason had very old worn seats (maybe moved from their older retired aircraft). That is probably the only minor complaint. Cabin crew friendly and efficient managed to serve meals and drinks and clean up on a very short 45 min flight. Both flights landed on time. Over all a good experience would fly with them again.,0
2014,Flew Phuket to Chiang Mai and got dinged nearly $60 CAD ($55 US) for a 20 kg bag. When I picked myself up off the floor I asked the desk person if I could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. Told to go to the website check in online and 'pre-register' my bag online. The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look. So watch out! Bag charges are exorbitant and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy.,1
2014,KL to Kota Kinabalu. I was hoping for a more Malaysian style welcome however I was not even shown to my seats. The cabin crew were fixing their hair and make up and chatting. I was not offended but in my 18 years of flying I have never seen such sight.,1
2014,DPS-PER. A320. Booked hot seats row 14 exit row but would have preferred row 1 - not available. Also booked Red Carpet departure from Bali. I can't recommend this enough. A great treat to be personally escorted from check in security customs. Then lounge access. Although the shared lounge was very ordinary. No fault of AirAsia. When flight was called we were again escorted through departure gate into private mini-bus to the plane. The rest of the queuing passengers seemed aghast to our VIP treatment but well worth ever cent. In fact the cost is minimal. On board meals were OK but limited breakfast are ordered Hotcakes. Flight attendants smiling and answering bells quickly but difficult to understand announcements as others have mentioned. Plane about 50% full. Many seats at rear from row 15 with people stretching out across. No cockpit announcements at all and late arrival by 20 minutes into Perth. Priority luggage off easily.,0
2014,Perth to Bali. A320. Booked hot seats row 1. Meal included but we weren't priority boarded as the website indicated. Crew friendly and helpful. Flight slight turbulence but arrived on time. New plane. Only hiccup was online check in with no luggage says we can go straight to departure gate but lucky we checked as you still need to go to web check in desk to reprint boarding pass. Plus many passengers in the wrong line up. One row for online web check and one not. Ground staff didn't appear interested that all passengers queuing all in one line. Signage was poorly indicating.,0
2014,Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8322 21 Mar 2014 DMK-CGK (A320). Website check-in is convenient check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in DMK is Manual and the staff check recheck and re- recheck if you have boarded or not. Crew welcoming and point to your seat. Announcements so fast no one can understand them. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food looks like it has been recycled on 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Pak Nassers Nasi Lemak) as I'm allergic to fish however the meal included Anchovies. Again on landing the announcements were so fast that we all just looked at each other in a daze. Overall I will fly them again but will bring my own food and water.,0
2014,Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8320 23 Mar 2014 CGK-DMK (A320). Website check-in is convenient CGK check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in CGK is utter chaos and staff are in Go away Go away mode. Again Crew welcoming and point to your seat (the Weekend uniform is extremely untidy it kills the image). Announcements again so fast. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food again looks like it has been recycled 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Satay with Asian Fried rice). Again no information that it contained Shrimp paste (I'm allergic to Seafood). On landing the announcements were so fast. Overall I will fly them again but as I said in my previous comment will bring my own food and water.,0
2014,Departed Perth to Denpasar return with the family. No delays on either flight. Service was standard budget airline though much better than Ryan or Easyjet. My only complaint is regarding the unbelievably bad quality of the inflight hot meals. I pre ordered them to simply break the boredom for the kids and wish I hadn't bothered. Disgusting and simply inedible.,0
2014,"Air Asia D7316 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing March 12-13. We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say ""yes"" but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said ""No we are a low cost airline"". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos. Loading the plane is a joke. It is basically a stampede to the plane out on the tarmac it is a total free for all on the tarmac.",1
2014,DMK-PHN-DMK - Not much to write about frankly as this is a low-fair airline. Having their base in DMK airport is a strategic move away from the chaotic Suvarnbhumi. Make sure you booked earlier as the ticket will be almost as expensive as the regular cost airline given booking only a couple weeks ahead. Check-in both DMK and PHN is no problem. Though I seem to have problem with mobile online check-in from my last trip.,0
2014,Pleasant surprise! Even if check-in was somewhat chaotic (in Krabi) the flight experience was nice. Clean plane comfortable seats and nice crew. Will fly them again and the prices are great.,0
2014,REP-KUL. I must say that fares aren't that much cheaper than full service airlines if you only book a few weeks in advance. There are a lot of additional fees some of which are not avoidable. If you have to change your flight you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security everything was a breeze. Organised boarding great cabin crew clean plane comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia. If its enough then book it.,0
2014,Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. Really good value for money. Plane is new. Very punctual. Cabin crew are well trained and nicely dressed. Seat is fine. Food is inexpensive but good quality and you can choose from a quite diversified menu. Boarding and disembarkation was organized very efficiently. Only inconvenience is you had to walk at KUL budget terminal for 10min from gate to plane through a shielded corridor.,0
2014,Have flown with AA a few times this time RT from CNX to PEN. On the way from CNX to PEN I had to pay for the first checked baggage twice just because I had a transit in Kuala Lumpur. You will never know where they are going to put you in the airplane unless you pay to choose seat.,1
2014,"We flew Air Asia twice during our trip to SE Asia. I found the process of check-in well organized and tolerable. A low cost airline is going to have large crowds to manage and they did a good job. The seats are tight but no worse than more expensive airlines. Ads are tedious but I am sure these keep the cost down. All in all a satisfactory experience. They got us where we wanted to go efficiently and on schedule. Isn't that what a ""Now everybody can fly"" airline supposed to do?",0
2014,While at Singapore Changi Airport it took me more than 2.5 hrs to queue just to check in. The AirAsia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. There was not enough staff to manage the queue many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. Many passengers were late to board the plane not to mention time to shop the DFS stores. My flight to Bali took off an hour late. Worst experience I had with a budget airline.,1
2014,Kuala Lumpur to Manila. Pre flight customer service was a nightmare. My flight was delayed before my trip I was sent an SMS to be advised of this. I was offered an earlier flight that wasn't going to work because I was travelling from Adelaide at that time. There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad. When it comes to Staff service I have based it on the pre customer service as that's where I experienced most of the customer service.,1
2014,Three short flights on Air Asia DMK-RGN RGN-DMK DMK-SGN. All flights via newish A320s. A little chaotic at check in for DMK flights but otherwise the boarding process was easy. Be aware though that they strictly enforce their carry on baggage regulations and I suggest you pay for a checked bag when you buy your ticket and carefully weigh it before check in. Plane interiors clean comfort OK for short flight and service friendly but I hate the banner ads on the luggage bins. Checked bags were delivered promptly on arrival.,0
2014,Kota Kinabalu Malaysia to Jakarta Indonesia. Value for money. No inflight entertainment. Food needs to be paid for with cash onboard. Terrible option for food. Seat is disaster. Nice airline to take for short distances due to economy value. Future travel will avoid this airline. Prefer Malaysia Airline.,1
2014,Delayed more than 3 hours on flight to Bali from Kuala Lumpur on 9 Jan 2014. Although the ground staff knew about the delay in advance they failed to inform the passengers early - not only were we not informed at check in counter but only 1 hour prior scheduled take off time when we were at the gate. The airline changed the flight number causing great confusion and inconvenience for all passengers. No embarkation cards were also given out on board which is a normal procedure with all airlines. Air Asia maybe a budget airline but this does not give it a right to do what they want and as they please. Terrible experience.,1
2014,KUL-PDG and KNO-KUL. Always a demonstration for a quality product on the ground and in the sky. Good information from booking until departure well trained and nice-to-look-at cabin crews good flight-deck-info good food and on-time. This airlines grows and grows and seems to have no visible problems with staff quantity/training logistics etc.,0
2014,AirAsia failed to get me CGK-JKT on Christmas Eve. All they offered was flight to Sydney and Melbourne - and make your own way there. Couldn't offer me a direct flight for 48 hours from KUL although MAS had spare seats.,1
2014,We travelled from Singapore to Krabi by Airasia Thailand on 29th December 2013. I have to say that I am not pleased with the punctuality of the airline. We were delayed as the flight arrived 20 minutes late from Krabi. Delayed again on the way back to Singapore. However the flight was smooth and seats were comfortable for a low cost carrier. A strange incident happened as we were approaching the terminal in Singapore. We were all ready to leave the aircraft when the pilot announced that we would push back to another gate. The process itself took another 30 minutes. So overall we were delayed by over an hour. But still the flight was very smooth and good.,0
2014,"Air Asia Indonesia. KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays. The first was due to arriving aircraft (two hours) and the second was due to ATC in SIN (boarded on time but one hour delay on the plane). The seats were comfortable for the short flights. The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap sure but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting. For our flight KUL-CGK there was no announcement of any delay until after the scheduled departure time (but they kept making announcements for other delays). Bring your patience for sure.",0
2014,July 16th Bangkok Don Muang to Phuket. Last year we arrived 20 minutes before departure at Don Muang airport in Bangkok (very difficult to reach during rush hour). There where several queues and we asked some Air Asia ground personnel if they could help. They helped us and about one minute before departure we entered the plain. Arriving in Phuket our luggage was also in good condition and well kept by the aircraft personnel. I think that Air Asia is worth the money.,0
2014,Airasia Indonesia. SUB-CGK. Overall the trip was good. The cabin crews were polite. But the staff service wasn't very good when I entered the boarding gate the staff hasn't placed the airport tax thing behind the boarding pass although we had paid to her. Because of that we should wait for minutes before boarding the aircraft.,0
2013,"I flew to Singapore from Sydney with Air Asia last week. I regret flying with AA. Pre-ordered meals were of very poor quality. There was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase - only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. The flight was freezing cold and I had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in ""hot"" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude. The flight attendants speak little English. They are careless. I think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as Qantas Economy.",1
2013,Impressed by flight FD3932 from Changi Airport to Don Mueang on the night of 5th Dec 2013. No long queue at Terminal 1 check in counter the staff really helpful toward us when I ask to be seat together with older parents. Though the aircraft had just arrived the crew showed no sign of tiredness and were helpful on boarding. Captain made announcement about the weather and greeted us when we started to fly into Thai air space. It's a little things that's count.,0
2013,It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. Everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. Your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft. Go for that little extra spending and choose a renowned airline.,1
2013,Flew from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and then KL to Melbourne. Check-in online simply didn't work for us using any type of computer. Was also unable to manage my booking as system never allowed us to log in. Check in at Bangkok airport horrendous. Had to argue with check in agent to change seats so both of us were seated together (something we attempted numerous times online). Book with realistic expectations as that's all you will receive. Make sure you're at the gate in plenty of time as the gate suddenly closes with no announcements.,0
2013,I with my wife travelled from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur on 5th Nov 2013 and from KL to Adelaide on 9th Nov 2013. Both the flights were comfortable and enjoyed journey.,0
2013,Flight from Guangzhou to Kuala Lumpur. All of their service is what the low cost airlines have. Normal seat without IFE without food serving. Recommend during great promotion and travel with only cabin baggage (quite expensive check-in baggage fee).,1
2013,I'm not sure what people are expecting when flying with a low cost airline. My trip Bali - Singapore was great maybe having average expectations when booking helped. I made a point of reading the fine print on the Air Asia website which saved me money by pre-booking my luggage and my seat first row of the plane. I was also happy to have paid for the meet and greet option as there were long check-in queues at 05.00 with 3 Air Asia flights departing early. No queue for me right to the front and then assisted with passport control and led to the business lounge (the lounge was pretty poor not Air Asia's fault). Crew were young polite and efficient. Well- done Air Asia!,0
2013,Chennai to Singapore with a stopover in Kuala Lumpur. The journey was great. Even though the flight from Chennai was delayed by half an hour and the seats were not so comfy I liked this airline because of the hospitality and cost. Thank you Airasia for this wonderful journey.,0
2013,DMK-PNH. Flight delayed maybe 30 min but arrived 15 min late. Communication regarding delay not sufficient. Otherwise very good flight in clean plane with friendly staff - as every time I've flown Air Asia. Did not have a meal on this flight but on previous flights food has varied between 2 & 4 stars in my book.,0
2013,I have flown six times with Air Asia this year and have found it to be a good airline for the price. The staff are friendly and the check-in staff have been helpful. The planes are always clean and comfy. The only down side to Air Asia is their KL terminal. The terminal is confusing the flights are nearly always late and the walk from the terminal to the plane can be long (especially if it is windy and raining). But for friendliness cleanliness and price I would recommend Air Asia.,0
2013,Traveled from COK to KUL (LCCT) and back on AK 1203/1204. The in-flight services were truly good and the on time performance has to be highlighted.,0
2013,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water.,1
2013,KUL-SIN-KUL. Overall flight experience is fair only. Flight delayed 20 min because one of the crews absence and had to wait for another staff to replace. The staff seem to be moody and not so friendly from KUL-SIN but from SIN-KUL the staff are happy and providing good service.,0
2013,"JKT-KUL. Flight was slightly behind schedule pre-booked a meal that tasted delicious. Flight attendants were in a good mood and the senior FA wished us ""happy Sunday and god bless you"". That made my day. Was on board the new plane. Looked very clean and the plane look liked it had been cleaned regularly.",0
2013,Don Muang - Phuket - Don Muang. Pre-booked assigned seats together (65bht) and meals (120 bht) in booking. Both flights excellent value at promo fares offered and even with the extras came to just over 100 pounds return for 2 people return. Flights on time aircraft very clean check-in at both airports very efficient. Airline food on way out OK but way back actually very good for an airline hot meal (roast chicken and thai green curry options for the return flight). Euro low cost carriers could learn a lot from the service and pricing model of their Asian counterparts. Only minor gripe is the lack of use of airbridge except departing Don Muang and wait for luggage on return flight.,0
2013,SYD - KUL - PEN - SIN. Was nervous about using a budget carrier but need not have been. SYD - KUL loads of spare seats around us at rear of plane. Samsung tablet provided decent entertainment. Food was as expected. KUL - PEN was delayed around 90 minutes with no announcement or board notice of when we would actually depart which was a little frustrating. Both KUL - PEN and PEN - SIN flights were cramped but for short flights at a bargain cost who cares. Will happily fly them again.,0
2013,SRG-KUL. Check in at Semarang airport was very messy and immigration was slow. Plane arrived early and at around 9am we took off. The meal that I ordered was delicious and the crew was very friendly towards the passengers. Don't expect too much from a low cost airline but at least the service offered by air Asia is good value for money highly recommended.,0
2013,Udon Thani - Phuket - Udon Thani. Both flights on time. Check in at Phuket a bit crazy because of Thai peoples lack of ability to understand which line to be in. Good friendly crew who explained the safety drill in perfect English. Captains announcements also perfectly spoken and clear. Soft drinks snacks and hot dishes are served at a cost which is not expensive. Overall a very enjoyable experience and would recommend to others.,0
2013,Bangkok - Macau return 20th Sep return on 22nd. Excellent flight for low budget airline choose the first row in plane priority boarding. Only problem was the 20 minutes delay with no explanations.,0
2013,I flew from KL to Miri and it was very pleasant. I was late and was the last passenger to board but Air Asia were very nice about it. Flight was smooth and arrived on time. Can't think of a single thing to criticise them except food could be better.,0
2013,I did six flights with AirAsia Indonesia and AirAsiaX from Sydney KL Makassar Denpasar Makassar KL Sydney. I found the airline to be exactly up to my expectations. It's a budget no frills low airfare airline. I'm not too tall 1.8m and not too fat 73 kgs so it was fine for me. The food was good and if I didn't want any extras I didn't have to pay for them. It was about half the fare on Jetstar/Qantas. Neither of which went to my main destination of Makassar.,0
2013,5/8/13 BKK-KUL FD2913 11/8/13 TGG-KUL AK6229. 12/8/13 KUL-Lombok AK1408. 24/8/13 DPS-BKK FD2977. I have recently flown several times on Air Asia. The planes have been immaculate the staff very helpful and they have an amazing turn around time and have always been on time. I was thoroughly impressed by the service and feel the budget airlines in Europe could learn a lot from them! We paid extra for a hot seat and were very comfortable with plenty of leg space. The price of this was cheap and I believe worth it. Baggage came through really quickly too. Only thing is no inflight entertainment at all but I was happy to use my iPad.,0
2013,Flew 4 times back in May 2013 as they are no doubt the major low-cost airline in Asia. One is DMK-PHN and another one is DMK-HKT. Both are returned flight. Good move by Thai AirAsia for choosing DMK as their hub - less hassle and easy to get to. Check-in was easy and it is how you talk with the check-in staff in order to get seat you want/close to your partner/friend. I flew with my fianc so we did manage to get the seat we want by just talking your way through. Aircraft is a new A319 which was a complete step-up from their old B737 a couple years ago I flew with them. Nothing fancy about cabin crew as we did not use their service at all (not buying any food). I would definitely fly them again - just because of their competitive price compared to other airline such as Bangkok Airways and Thai Airways.,0
2013,DMK-SGN. First ever flight on the Air Asia group and I was greatly surprised. DMK is great with Air Asia international check in very easy. Plane was new clean and on-time. Crew were relaxed and friendly. The hot seat exit row is money well spent - did not bother with food on such a short leg. I would definitely recommend this airline and will readily use them again.,0
2013,"March 9 2013. DMK-KUL AK1941. March 12 2013 KUL-DMK FD2916. You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty.",1
2013,"SUB-KUL-HKT-CNX-KUL-SUB. SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes. I am not going to fly Air Asia again unless I have no other choice.",1
2013,"Air Asia Japan: I got an excellent deal around 10000 yen return to Sappor half the price of ANA and JAL. One way ticket with absolutely no frills. Aircraft smelling new cabin crew quite nice seat pitch very tight but bearable for a short flight something to expect for a LCC. I was extremely surprised by their ""boarding"" gate and waiting area: it was some space taken from a warehouse and a tent from where passengers are bussed to the airplane. Although I know it's a LCC it it's not what I expected for a major international airport! Arrival and Departure at Sapporo was at a ""deluxe"" gate with a boarding bridge and normal waiting room next to ANA gates.Otherwise it was OK and good price/quality. But do not expect anything luxurious from them!",0
2013,Pekanbaru to Bandung and vice versa. During the flight there was nothing too special. Special services for passengers with red carpet service in Pekanbaru - nothing. Should correspond to their advertising - red carpet passenger will be allowed to board the plane first but red carpet passengers in Pekanbaru were mixed with ordinary passengers during boarding. In fact there were regular passengers before me on my first flight.,0
2013,SGN-KUL-LGK-KUL-SGN. Online check in is convenient but document check in LCCT KUL (KUL-SGN) is very inconvenient for pax because of lack of information on screen (line for KUL-SGN flight) change counter and waiting at gate (Y1 Y2) so long. The arrangement in terminal is not good pax standing in font of Y1 Y2 gate will be bother by others going to oversize luggage inside. In flight LGK-KUL there was a medium turbulence on take-off phase airplane was down but no announcement was delivered.,0
2013,FD 2976/2977 Bangkok -Denpasar return. A very disappointing experience. Checked in online and only had to drop our bag spent over an hour at the counter waiting for staff to reconcile their problem. Good that they are using Don Muang Airport otherwise the long immigration line would worsen the experience unorganized boarding and people in hot seats ended up among the last to board. Things get slightly better on the aircraft. Emergency exit  hot seat pretty comfortable with no other passengers next to me and I end up taking all 3 seats for myself. Pre- ordered breakfast (Pancake) is delicious great punctuality. Other than that things are pretty horrible and chaotic. Pre-ordered food on the return flight inedible rice stale meat overcooked and obviously is re-heated more than once. Drinks sold on board are lukewarm Flight attendants try to be overly friendly. Hot seat when the plane is full became unbearable for such long flight. Will avoid in the future.,1
2013,PER-KUL-DMK. Booked ticket 3 months earlier received reminder/confirmation email 4 days before departure 2 days before departure another email showing different times by 5 hours - no explanation just confirmation of flights but with different departure/arrival times. Arrival at DMK (Bangkok) would have had us there 1 hour after our connecting flight had left. No option but to go 1 day earlier and stay in hotel. Chaotic check-in at DMK under staffed 1 hour just waiting to check-in not good enough especially when it's a premium ticket they claim dedicated check-in for premium but no such counter exists. At the end of it all total cost was more than $100 more each than original quote on find flights result page.,1
2013,Air Asia Indonesia CGK-DPS. Convenient and fast. Booking process is smooth and check-in just needs a QR code and the scanner at the airport. Staff are friendly young and vibrant. I only recommend short (5 hour max) trips with them. It's a point to point carrier and not one you should use for long distance.,0
2013,Cochin to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. There is practically no leg space. Add to it the fact that I had a window seat with the other two seats filled in by slightly heavyset people and I felt like I didn't even have breathing space. It was so cramped that I didn't have space to move my hands. The choice of food on board is poor. Even when I asked for something that was on the menu they didn't have it. The only good thing was the rate but given the condition of the flight even the cheap rates do not sound tempting.,1
2013,I flew with AirAsia in May from Bandung to Pekanbaru. Overall pretty good and smooth flight. However there is a bit of chaos at the time of the boarding because it coincides with Lion Air to Surabaya at the departure gate only existing in Bandung airport.,0
2013,Flights were on time and that's about the only good thing I've experienced with this airline. Throughout my Southeast Asia journey I flew Air Asia 4 times and each time had a terrible time booking and then with customer service. Their website is a hassle to navigate and there is so many extra fees! They randomly cancel flights and rebook you without checking then when you have to rebook that flight the website doesn't work and there are no phone numbers to be found. They say they can only help you through live chat but it never works. At one point we resorted to going to the airport and talking to them where they admitted they had read out emails and just did not reply. I've never seen an airline less flyer friendly. Good thing they're cheap. Never flying air Asia again.,1
2013,SYD-KUL was 30 minutes late but the food was okay. The only things I really did was play on my ipad because the flight was very boring. KU-SYD night flight was on time but no food or beverages. Toilets were clean on both flights and the seats look brilliant but 2 hours into the flight you can clearly see the poor padding. I also couldn't get to sleep on the night flight. Overall Air Asia is ok but I would prefer Qantas or Virgin.,0
2013,KUL-CMB CMB-KUL. Flight time to CMB was changed to 6 hours later and return flight to KUL was cancelled. No Refund given. Had to fly MAS to KUL.,1
2013,DMK-SIN SIN-HKT HKT-DMK. DMK a joy no queues large open spaces as not many pax plenty of seats easy check in at airport with bags coming in right on the weight had paid for. Zero lines at passport control and security. Had exit row hot seats for 1st leg and they were great so much leg room. Cabin staff also enforced the seats with people trying to move in to the empty row in front of us and all were removed. Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy. I think if I was taking anything longer than 2 hours I would pay for the exit row. 3rd leg Phuket airport showing its age and in dire need of a revamp. but again no issues with TAA on arrival used jet way and bags arrived quickly.,0
2013,Jakarta - Singapore on Friday on the 17.30 using the Red Carpet service was an enjoyable experience. Check-in was prompt and efficient and the lounge used basic but comfortable. One issue is that I had to pay for a beer which was poor as it's included in KL. A very efficient member of staff took my passport away and processed it with immigration which was good. I was accompanied through to the Departure Lounge and even accompanied across the tarmac before everyone else. Aircraft clean and comfortable and cabin crew very professional. Visited Air Asia in Changi re. complaint from my SIN-CGK flight in Red Carpet without lounge access offered in Changi - it'll be interesting to see if I ever get a reply or refund!,0
2013,"I am en route back from Singapore to Phnom Penh with Air Asia after learning much to my disgust what Air Asia means by ""point to point"" service. I flew from Yangon to Singapore and expected - to be able to get a boarding pass from Yangon to Singapore and check my bags through. I am an experienced traveler and fly constantly. When I landed in KL I was to my surprise required to go through immigration and customs in Kuala Lumpur pick up my bag check through the confusing Air Asia terminal recheck my bags and then go through the whole process to get on to Singapore. As I had bought a ticket from Singapore to Phnom Penh with only 90 minutes between flights - plenty of time for a normal carrier not for Air Asia's bizarre system - I had to change my return flight pay them $55 USD for the pleasure of spending 4 hours in the horrible Air Asia Terminal. They impose a huge burden on customers doing this. The Air Asia web site is excellent - and if they wanted the could easily alert customers that 90 minutes is not enough time to go through their transfer system but of course they do not. Don't fall for it.",1
2013,"My experience has been very negative flying with them. I flew with them last weekend from Phuket to Jakarta and the flight was 6 hours delayed. Absolutely no compensation provided. Our flight was changed from 7.30pm to 1.30am so we eventually arrived at 3.30am. No apologies or explanation given by the airline either. On top of this we paid for a ""hot seat"" which was uncomfortable and didn't recline. Never flying with them again. The food choices were also really bad. Many things were missing from the menu as they ""ran out"".",1
2013,In the last month my husband and I went on 4 Air Asia flights. It was a mixed experience. The inflight entertainment is very limited. Whilst some of the service was good and they were generally courteous there were inconsistencies across the board. We paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. But on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy. An experience which has really left a very poor taste in my mouth was having a check in lady be very rude and abrupt with my husband.,1
2013,I flew from Singapore to Jakarta on May 14th and opted for the Red Carpet Service paying S$55 for the extra service. I thought check in was efficient but it turns out I should have been given lounge access but this didn't happen so I bought breakfast. I guess the priority boarding was good but I'd had to pay extra for my seat allocation as well. The flight was good with friendly and helpful crew and regular updates from the flight deck. I'm flying back to Singapore on May 22nd from Jakarta and look forward to a good flight in seat 1A.,0
2013,I used Air Asia to fly back to Australia from Vietnam where I now live. On the KL to Gold Coast leg I went to buy a meal using Vietnam Dong and was refused service as they don't accept this currency. They also would not accept a credit card! Hence I was looking at an 8 hour flight with no food or water. It took a lot of complaining for the staff to give me a single 250 ml bottle of water to last me the entire flight! I had to get to talk to the head steward as the others simply walked away from me and refused to offer anything whatsoever. The cabin crew completely ignored me after that and could not have cared less about my situation. I will never use this carrier again.,1
2013,DPS-SIN. Efficient check in and boarding. Flight left on time and seat was comfortable. Food was tasty and cheap (bought on line before). Overall a great experience and everything that you could ask for from a low cost airline.,0
2013,Clark-KUL economy. Flight according to schedule. On time. No fuss. Good leg room. Hard working kind and pleasant staff. Will fly with AA again - much better than other budget airlines I have flown with and great value for money.,0
2013,"KUL-SGN. Lovely looking stewardesses and new aircraft. Reasonably comfortable seats even for my 6ft 2"" 18 stone frame. But check in immigration departure lounge baggage reclaim? Just prepare to be treated third class and expect to be herded like cattle. They certainly bring a whole new level to ""no frills airlines"". Cheap and great for hopping around South East Asia truly the Greyhound in the skies.",1
2013,PEN-SIN. Short flight from Penang to Singapore. A320 aircraft looked fairly new in good clean condition. Buy on board service was efficient and well priced. Arrived on time. No issues would defiantly fly with the again especially for the bargain prices that they offer.,0
2013,Nov 2012 SYD-CLARK PH. Plane was new and clean and we left on time. Service was excellent and the food was well priced and good quality. Aisles are narrow and seats not made for anyone above average size. Plane arrived on time. No entertainment but was great value for the money.,0
2013,I was on CGK-SUB vv flight (QZ 7680 on Mar 17 and QZ 7685 on Mar 19). They were pretty much on schedule. Everything in general was good. The airline has revised the boarding procedure by managing the boarding passengers. Good strategy to minimize the ground time and maintain the on time performance although a bit inconvenient to the passengers.,0
2013,"Melbourne - Chiang Mai return. Plane was a little late leaving Chiang Mai and due to ""congestion"" our plane landed at the international airport - presumably not carrying enough fuel to wait for a landing slot. Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food. Minimal breakfast in hotel but no lunch offered even though our substitute flight was 1.45pm. Low budget should not mean such rubbish service when the airline is at fault.",1
2013,I have taken 2 trips to Phuket in the last 6 months flying AirAsia from the Gold Coast I found them to be an excellent airline they always left on time and arrived on or before the advertised arrival time the cabin crew are great and the food was not bad either the in flight entertainment was ok. They had the shortest travel times from all the airlines that fly to Phuket and the best prices.,0
2013,Flew from Cochin to KL to Incheon. If you are taller than 180cm there will be not be enough room for your legs. They will push up against the seat in front and you will constantly get bumped if you're sitting in the aisle. Having to wait at LCCT is an awful experience. The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced. While boarding the crew insist on blasting cheesy rock music regardless of the time. The vegetarian food is over- priced for the small serving I received. The amount of money saved is minimal after adding up all of the extra costs.,1
2013,My first domestic trip CNX-DMK return. Was pleased to see what they had done with DMK. Disappointed that we were bussed to terminal but as it dropped us off nearer baggage area without walking far we shouldn't grumble. Efficient boarding at both ends meant early arrival on both sectors. Had the pancake combo for breakfast. Surprised that the drink offered was water and not coffee. I only used them as a friend arrived at DMK also with Air Asia. Price was almost same as Bangkok Airways to BKK and will continue to use them if flying to BKK and beyond. But TAA and DMK is an attractive alternative if just flying to BKK.,0
2013,PEN-SIN on a very new A320. Pre selected seat in the first row (1D) as I wanted to have a fast clearance out of Changi Airport. Aircraft was pushed back 10 minutes before ETD and arrived SIN 20 mins earlier than ETA. Efficient cabin crew.,0
2013,I have been flying with my wife who has problems walking and needs a wheelchair from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and return. Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip). If you consider all this the price is not too different from what you can get on regular airlines and this will be my choice next time.,1
2013,Flew BKK to Singapore with Thai Air Asia. Another bus to the plane. Lot's of empty stands but I think the Airbus and stand do not match. They boarded the bus by row numbers but this soon turned into a free for all. Staff friendly and the normal service standards of a budget airline. Couldn't beat the price compared to the full service airlines.,0
2013,Flight AK1441 from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. Booking and flight document indicated departure of 21.00 Vietnam time and arrival 23.15pm Malaysia time with no delay in departure time. Arrived Kuala Lumpur at 01.15 (the next day) without any transit only to find out later that an added 2hrs flight is due to inconsistency in flight details generated by airline's system against actual flight duration. Ample of residual consequences including airport pickup charter and hotel booking arising with the timing mistake made by the airline's system.,1
2013,Traveled to Denpasar Bali on Dec 2013. Had no issue with the QZ flight the ground staff and flight crew in KUL were attentive and nice. However for the return flight the ground staff in Bali didn't even bother to explain to us regarding the flight delay it was delayed over 3 hours. No refreshments at all. Just an announcement regarding the gate change. I've had delayed flights with AA while in KUL they provided us info on why the aircraft was late even meal vouchers and food but not in Bali. Very disappointing!,0
2013,Flew from Don Muang Bangkok to Jakarta. Planes clean and new flights were on time crew indifferent seats narrow. However considering the price a very good alternative especially in Bangkok where you can enjoy the now (almost) empty Don Muang Airport with no queues at the immigration and fast luggage deliveries.,0
2013,Flew from SYD-KUL return. Was quite happy with them on the first leg apart from the poor airport at LCCT on the return leg they changed the rules for cabin baggage denying both of us a second carrier bag allowed onboard. Very disappointing and rude ground staff. Very poor organisation. On the same flight staff failed to secure toilet doors before takeoff so they swung open abruptly. I'd avoid flying them again.,1
2013,Flew from Sydney to Penang via KL then Penang to KL KL to Miri Miri to Kuching Kuching to KL and then on to Singapore. Both ground and air crews were excellent extremely helpful and kind with our elderly parents with mobility issues. Check in at all airports was quick and efficient. Arrival at KL LCCT was a shock did not expect to have to walk the long distance from the tarmac to the terminal building in the hot blazing sun. Most airports would have a bus to transport the passengers to the terminal building. Not a good first impression of KL. Will certainly fly AirAsia again.,0
2013,Bangkok to Singapore on 30/1/13. Easy check in at Don Muang airport and was given an aisle seat as requested. Friendly airline staff and a good selection of food on sale. A little different to the grumpy lot on my next flight on Qantas from Singapore to Sydney.,0
2013,Recently flew return from Bangkok Don Muang to Chiang Mai. Check-in was very good at both airports both flights were on time nice clean aircraft and first rate cabin crew.,0
2013,DMK-DMK and DMK-KBV return on A320. Check in was quick. Flights on time. Seats comfortable and decent legspace. Crew attentive and polite. Food was decent. Luggage arrived promptly. Did miss that you could not buy a beer.,0
2013,When 4 of us were flying from BKK-KUL on 15 Dec there was a 2 hrs delay and we missed our connecting flight to Kuching. All flights to East Malaysia were fully booked to an extend where no standby passengers were allowed. We tried to check with all other airlines none were available. When I presented my case to AirAsia counter at LCCT somehow the counter staff was able to fly us home. We appreciated their effort to make our travel comfortable even in a 'hopeless' situation. Most recently when AirAsia halted their KL/CMB/KL flights 14 of us were affected from 27 Feb to 5 Mar. Refund was fast even our connecting flights were refunded. Value for money. In terms of comfort services and planes are good. LCCT is sometimes below par especially the female washrooms - wet and smelly! Hopefully the new KLIA 2 will be a better terminal.,0
2013,The last time I flew Air Asia was when I returned back from Medan to Surabaya. It was a very long flight for an Indonesian domestic flight. More than 3 hours. It supposed to be a good flight but due to a delay my flight departed in the evening and I was devoid of scenery as it was dark. Seat pitch was not great for a flight longer than one hour. I had a mixed feeling over the food. The fried rice was terrible but the satay was great.,0
2013,I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi. The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint. This airline makes changes to suit itself and save money but never makes changes for its customers.,1
2013,Numerous flights REP-KUL KUL-HKT HKT-KUL KUL-SGN. Experiences differ at each airport but check-in and boarding was smooth. Nice leather seats and although not a lot not bare minimum legroom. Good selection of food and drink (which was very cheap). The satay chicken was quite oily however the tandoori chicken wraps were nice. Every flight was on-time if not early. The Kuala Lumpur LCCT is a bit old and grubby but then again you do have to expect that when travelling low-cost.,0
2013,Gold Coast to Colombo Sri-Lanka Via Kuala Lumpur. Flight was good and food tasted alright. We had no problems with baggage and staff were not all that bad. I didn't like the fact that you had to pay extra for in- flight entertainment and had no screen on the back of the seat in front of you but that is common with most budget airlines. I would certainly recommend Air Asia just remember you get what you pay for.,0
2013,I've flown with Air Asia often last time at NYE next time 19th January. Flights are usually on time some delays of 30 mins sometimes but never had my flight cancelled. The attendants are friendly and the aircraft is clean. If you manage to plan ahead you can get really good promotions. Overall good service mainly considering you are flying a low budget airline.,0
2013,Bangkok to Yangon Yangon to KUL and KUL to Bangalore. Flights left slightly late. Food available on board was reasonably priced and good quality. However I was intrigued that each time we weighed in our bags on the Air Asia scales they were 1kg to 1.5 kg heavier than on Qantas or Thai scales - and we had exactly the same contents in them. I also noticed that the crew paid scant attention to young children who did not have seat belts on.,0
2013,Flew with 2 others from KUL-PEN on 1/1/2013. Bought the Red Carpet service which was made the whole experience really good from check in to baggage claim. We got the seats we asked for (front row) and were very comfortable for the short flight. Friendly cabin crew. No complains at all about the flight.,0
2013,Melbourne to Singapore with a stopover in KUL. Plane was clean with comfortable lighting. The seat's pitch is not a problem but the issue lies with the amount of shoulder space between passengers. There is just not enough space if you have broad shoulders. The seats are comfortable for smaller builds only. I had to lean on one side throughout my 8 hour flight. The poor quality padding starts to present itself about 2 hours into flight. The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value. I personally would prefer more space on long haul flights. Again what you pay is what you get.,0
2013,I have flown with AA numerous times over the past 5 years both internationally and domestically and as with every thing 'always read the fine print' and you will have no problems (you have to check the box to verify that when you purchase your ticket). You get what you pays for and Air Asia overall do precisely that with a minimum of fuss and bother.,0
2013,Langkawi-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KUL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for the time end of April. Meal was very good. Staff on board very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a normal. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.,0
2013,Following the below review of our trip from Tokyo-Sapporo the return flight Sapporo-Tokyo was cancelled leaving us with the option of travelling the following day or getting a refund. To give a refund is to shirk responsibility. Anyway I suppose low-cost travel is fine provided nothing goes wrong. If it does you're completely stuck at a foreign airport. Overall the cheap experience from beginning to end is probably not worth it unless you're desperate to save $50 on the ticket price at the purchase stage. We will certainly not be using low-cost air travel again if it can possibly be helped.,1
2013,Bandung to Pekanbaru on 9th December. At the time I bought the tickets scheduled for 3.40 pm but 3 days prior to departure the schedule suddenly changed to 5.35 am. A very disappointing change.,1
2013,We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.,1
2013,Our flight was diverted on the way to Phuket and we were dumped in Bangkok at midnight with no information let alone a hotel. Over 200 passengers were forced to fight for 8 available hotel rooms that they had to pay for themselves. After over a 12 hour wait the flight then boarded again but was then further delayed as they had messed up the luggage getting to the plane. It ended up with bags on the tarmac and passengers pointing out the windows to their bags. The staff were downright rude and refused to even provide a drink.,1
2012,Sydney-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. Seats 25 over wing. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for Christmas Day. Meal was ok - probably would have been nicer if it was hotter. Staff onboard very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a touch narrow and sitting on the aisle I was continually bumped. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.,0
2012,Booked a return flight from Bangkok to Krabi with my wife. She was 27 weeks pregnant and we confirmed with Air Asia before flying that nothing special was required. We flew to Krabi and all was perfect. On the way back we were seated onboard for 5 minutes when a crew member asked us to leave the plane as we did not have any authorization to fly. We were left at 8.30pm in the empty airport with no solution for us to go back home. Luckily we could take a Thai Airways flight home.,1
2012,Having flown Air Asia X and the domestic service on numerous occasions I have only experienced one glitch. On a return flight from Kuching to KUL the incoming flight to Kuching was almost 3.5 hours late. No explanation was offered. As a consequence I failed to catch a connecting flight from KL to Penang. The counter staff at LCCT were helpful and reissued my ticket. The only problem was that this was the last flight to Penang that evening. It was a very long day! Providing you leave 3 to 4 hours leeway if you have another flight booked generally AA are pretty good. It is really a question of value for money and AA are exceptional in this respect.,0
2012,CGK-DPS (Dec 9) and DPS-CGK (Dec 12) flight. The first stint was on time but the later one about 10 minutes delayed although eventually we arrived only 5 minutes late. Everything in general very good.,0
2012,Travelled in a group of 40 KUL-CNX on 29/11/2012. Upon arrival to LCCT the crowd at LCCT was horrendous especially during holiday season. However we managed to check in our luggage within an hour thanks to efficient ground staff who was at the counter alone. CNX-KUL on 2/12/2012. Chiang Mai airport was much more less crowded early in the morning it was only AK flight at that time but were surprised that the check in procedure took more than an hour! There were one lady at front counter one at the back helping to cut the e-boarding pass and stick the stickers to the check in luggage. We should have been checked in as a group and not 2 by 2! My question is what if there are 3-4 groups checking in simultaneously? Some could miss the flight?,1
2012,"Phuket-Chiang Mai Economy. Air Asia is riding the budget airline wave and doing a reasonable job of it. We ordered some food when we booked (Pancakes and Satay) which turned out to be decent. Everything went smoothly and on time. My only grief was how tightly packed the seats are onboard. I'm 6'1"" and used to being a bit squished on airlines. These seats were the worst I'd ever been on without question. In our case the flight was a little over an hour and we had the row to ourselves to spread out. I would never book this airline for longer legs with more passengers.",0
2012,We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Vientiane and back and found Air Asia very good both the ground staff and cabin crew were excellent the aircraft was one of the cleanest I have travelled on and the cost and range of drinks and food were also very good. Outbound flight departed on time and on our return we actually departed a little early. Keeping in mind the low price we paid for tickets for a two and half hour flight Air Asia provided excellent value for money and we would certainly use them again.,0
2012,Night flight from DMK-KUL last week and the flight was delayed 45 minutes. This week my friends took flight to SIN and CGK (both were from KUL) and both flights were delayed for 45 and 40 minutes. They had to pay midnight charges on their return trip from the airports not to mention the normal hassle when you got delayed.,1
2012,Having found a promotion fare from CNX-MFM I thought I would try the latest destination out of Chiang Mai. I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau. It quickly became apparent as most of the pax were in a tour group from mainland china. Standard Air Asia service although this time I booked a hotseat and had a nice chicken lasagne. Flight was 30 mins early. No jetway at MFM but the walk in fact makes getting to immigration easier. Next to the airport is a new jetfoil service to Hong Kong.,0
2012,Flights from Pekanbaru to Bandung and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to me. However flight attendants are not very friendly towards passengers. Other than that I think no problems the flight on time.,0
2012,"Having checked online for Yangon to Bangkok it just remained to have documents checked at the appropriate desk. 50 minutes later still waiting. They allowed passengers with checked luggage to use the same line and then a tour group had problems with documentation. Instead of asking them to stand aside to fill in the documents they let them block the line. The supervisor said ""you could have joined another line"" - yes at the back again!",1
2012,I could not check in online therefore did not know that luggage food and entertainment had to be pre- booked. At the airport we had to pay $240 for luggage because I had not checked in online. This holiday was purchased as a package and the flights were to be with Jetstar. The trip took too long overall with waiting time in airports but the worst part was that on the return the flight was supposed to leave Phuket at 7.30pm and was delayed until 9.30pm. Staff kept assuring us the flight to Australia would wait for us. This did not happen and the plane left before we arrived were put up in sub standard hotel for the night. Quite a long day for a 1.5 hour flight from Phuket. Not acceptable. I also told staff we had a domestic flight booked to Brisbane on the Sunday and they told me it was nothing to do with them.,1
2012,Perth to KL and 8 days later back to Perth. We were fortunate to obtain hot seats which proved to be excellent plenty of room. Coming home we changed our flight to travel with friends that left a day earlier. Changes were made efficiently but we were unable to get hot seats. Pleasantly surprised at the amount of leg room was able to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front with no effort. Didn't order food. We found staff to be pleasant efficient and I would not hesitate to book Air Asia again. The only thing I would make sure next time that I had a laptop to watch movies. Excellent flight and landed 20 minutes early.,0
2012,Sydney to Kuala Lumpur then onto Phuket. Trip over went ok return trip was a disaster. I received a notification from the airline that there would be a delay at Kuala Lumpur I tried to get a later flight from Phuket to no avail. On arrival at Kuala Lumpur the transfer desk had one employee there so 1.5 hrs in a queue then immigration another 1 hr in a queue then a 10 hr delay at the airport. No explanation no apologies just a voucher for a hamburger. Never Again.,1
2012,Seoul to Indonesia. My flight plan was supposed to be Seoul - Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur - Jakarta. The 2nd flight was delayed 2hrs and I missed my connecting flight in Jakarta because of that. Customer service agents didn't do anything except proposing I take the next flight (would get me stuck in Jakarta) or buy another flight ticket to my final destination. I choose the 2nd solution but didn't arrive at my final destination and lost over 200 in the end.,1
2012,Bangkok-Phuket one-way economy Oct 2012. Price was a little more than I expected (about US$120) but online booking payment and seat selection was very easy. Flight departed on time and cabin crew seemed very determined to get everyone to destination as quickly and comfortably as possible. You pay for everything including water but food and drinks prices were very low. Seats reasonably comfortable. Overall satisfactory flight and I would fly them again.,0
2012,KUL-LOP-KUL in October 2012. My first trip to Lombok Indonesia. Took advantage of the launch fares (RM 88) and can't complain about the price for a 3 hour 1200+ mile flight. LCCT was its usual mess but I have worked out my standard operating procedure so that I got to the departure hall in good time. Lombok international airport was a little better for departure but arrival hall clearance was slow. The flights were on time and uneventful. Typical AirAsia (AK) service.,0
2012,CNX-KUL. Arrived at airport about 30 minutes before scheduled departure time only to find that checkin stops 45 minutes before and the automatic check in machine was programmed not to check me in as I was deemed late. I checked in at the desk without any problem without checked bags. Plane was late inbound but we made up the time on the flight south. Standard AirAsia service with reasonable cabin crew. Not their latest aircraft but interior in good condition. I was lucky to be off the aircraft quickly as the skies opened and there was a short sharp downpour and anyone from the rear of the plane would have been a drowned rat as there is no jetway from AirAsia flights.,0
2012,3 hours delay on the flight Jakarta-Singapore. No information about what is going on delaying every half an hour. Horrible customer attention Service is awful.,1
2012,"The check-in at KLIA LCCT was chaotic. I took the 10pm flight from KUL to PEN on 27th August (after a very good flight on AirAsia Premium from SYD). I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers. AirAsia is a real mess at LCCT. I have taken more than 50 AA flights including KUL PEN JHB SIN. KUL LCCT is shameful a disappointment to what is otherwise a great Low-Cost Airline.",0
2012,We flew BLR-KUL-CLARK in July-Aug and were pleasantly surprised at the level of service offered by AirAsia. We went in fearing worst after reading reviews about the airline and also about the LCCT in KL. However we came back fully satisfied with AirAsia's service and the amenities offered at LCCT. You really cannot expect more for the fares on offer and it wasn't as if there was a dearth of choices. Both airline and terminals were perfectly serviceable. My only suggestion to AirAsia would be to offer at least one vegetarian food choice on non-India routes.,0
2012,BKK-KUL BKK-HKT (two times) BKK-URT-BKK BKK-CEI-BKK. Flight was nice cabin crew helpful and responsible price cheap compared to other airlines. I would recommend them.,0
2012,Flew SYD/KUL and the KUL/PHUKET return. All flights on time web check in was good and saved long queues at the airport easily checked bags in at Sydney that were checked all the way through. No food or entertainment this was expected so was not a problem. Travelled with our 4 kids ensured they had colouring in books iPods etc. Flight was fine at the end of 9 hrs flying they were ready to get off but behaved well without normal flight gadgets. Also took my own food on board was not stopped and didn't have a problem. Staff not very friendly and don't bother you at all. Overnight flight home tried for Premium upgrade was not successful very difficult to sleep although the flight did seem quicker at night. Would recommend as long as you realise it is a budget airline.,0
2012,BLR-KUL-REP. The seats are tight. If you are tall you're going to have a problem. On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.,0
2012,Jakarta to Singapore (QZ7782) and back (QZ7789) on the same day. No delays. The right Low Cost Carrier experience: no frills no food no leg room efficient.,0
2012,Singapore - Miri Miri - KUL. Cabin staff were more interested in themselves and each other than actually doing anything vaguely like serving passengers. A smile from half way across the cabin isn't service it is nice but that is all. The only good thing about AirAsia is the price. There was not even cabin staff ensuring passengers stored their bags for take off and landing properly.,1
2012,I was going from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and had a connecting flight from there to Copenhagen. I had nearly 6 hours to reach the connecting flight. Less than a week before going they cancelled the flight and rebooked me in a new one nearly 3 hours later. However this flight was delayed and I was too late to reach my flight. That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours. They could not see it as their problem that I was delayed more than 4 hours because of the rescheduling.,1
2012,PEN-SIN. Check-in was quick as I did not have luggage and boarding was on time. Departed 10 minutes earlier and arrived 15 minutes before schedule. Flight was good and flight attendants were polite but seemed tired as this was the last flight of the day. The only thing I find annoying is that you cannot change your ticket if your flight leaves within 48 hours. Otherwise Air Asia provide a good service which is better than some other airlines.,0
2012,"I have flown Air Asia 8 times between CGK-SIN-CGK I have been on-time once. Regardless of price this is unacceptable. Each delay has been from 30 minutes to 3 hours and this is with good weather. I always pick a hot seat exit row. The pitch is fine but it's still tight. Crew's for the most part are friendly. They seem to be getting the Lion air attitude. ""Yea were late so what"". Anyway I'm heading back to Singapore Airlines. Yes it's more money but the delays are out of control at Air Asia.",1
2012,Flew from Bangkok (BKK) to Jakarta (CGK) on 27th June this year 2012. Paid for the trip by credit card now you have pay for the processing of the transaction. Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline. Air Asia when they first started out were a good low cost airline and value for money but they have declined dramatically the prices have gone up and everything connected with the airline has gone down. I won't fly with them again!,1
2012,Flight from KUL-HAN was on time. The check in was smooth through until boarding. Aircraft's parked far away from our boarding gate. We walked more than 300 metres. Seat comfort and leg room are extremely poor. Staff were nice. However on our return trip from Hanoi a male crew was standing like a poster man. Neither instructed to ease the boarding flow nor helping a nanny who was holding her grandson to stow her hand luggage. Low cost airline shouldn't mean low cost in assisting passengers who need help.,1
2012,Singapore to Kuala Lumpur: flight on time fast boarding and very attentive staff. Great value for money. Just a little negative note about the low cost terminal in Kuala Lumpur: you have to walk a lot to reach the terminal the hot weather makes it more difficult together with the engine noises and the smell of fuel. Anyway I would fly again with Air Asia.,0
2012,The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,1
2012,Flew from Singapore to KL. Great flight aircraft was clean and very comfortable. Plane left on time and arrived early at destination. Flight crew was very pleasant and helpful. I was very happy with the flight and had a great experience.,0
2012,Flight from SUB-BKK-HKT-BKK and KUL-SUB. The service was very bad and the crew very rude. I flew to Bangkok and then Phuket and always got a seat that couldn't recline because the button was broken seat pitch was also very bad. The Low cost carrier Terminal in Kuala Lumpur was very bad ground crew very rude to passengers. Don't use this airline you'll be very disappointed with its service crew and much more.,1
2012,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asias office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you uncheck them. Boarding in BKK was a case of first rush first aboard. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,1
2012,SUB-BKK then BKK-HKT-BKK and last KUL-SUB. The crew was impolite and unfriendly. When onboard from SUB to BKK and KUL to SUB I always found that my seat couldn't recline because the button had broken the seat pitch also unacceptable. When I was in the LCC terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. This airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you. AirAsia really disappointed me.,1
2012,CGK-SIN. 15 minutes delay but it doesn't really matter. Crews were friendly bought nasi lemak onboard and it was delicious. Too bad the announcement was bad because it seems like the announcer didn't know what to speak. Overall a great experience.,0
2012,GOLD COAST-KUL-BKI-KUL-GOLD COAST. Flights took off on time. Our pre-booked meals were hot and delicious. Service was good but seats were very uncomfortable as it had no proper back support. Online booking for KUL-BKI sector had us all in different seats so we had to pay again to sit together. LCCT needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The signboards and facilities are in dire need of improvement. Toilets are wet and slippery. The taxi coupon tickets are a blessing and I have discovered during our shopping trips in KL that the taxi drivers driving the red and white cabs will refuse to use the meters to charge more.,0
2012,Flew from KUL-BKI on 27 May 2012. Service is awful. No direction whatsoever from the ground staff. Queue system was a disaster as there's no indication of which line to go to. The monitor didn't help at all and I have a couple going to KCH queuing in front of me and a group going to Kuantan behind me. What a mess. The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle. My flight end up with 2 passengers to Johor and it took them 40 minutes to find that out.,1
2012,Just flew 9 flights in total with Air Asia X and Air Asia: Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur - Kuala Lumpur to Vietnam - Vietnam to Kuala Lumpur - Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong - Hong Kong to Penang - Penang to Langkawi - Langkawi to Penang - Penang to Kuala Lumpur - Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast. Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available. I believe improvements can be made in this area. Otherwise the seats facilities service is great - expect to get what you pay for and you'll be more than happy.,0
2012,BKK-CNX-BKK and BKK-DPS-BKK booked a year in advance for a bargain price during their annual promotion. 2 out of 4 flights were delayed by about 1 hour. Service onboard was good with friendly crew who were available throughout the flights. Seats were tight but bearable even for the 4.5 hour flight BKK-DPS. Baggage delivery was fast with less than 20 min waiting time on each sector. FD is nothing fancy you won't get pampered but if you can get a cheap fare and don't mind an occasional delay then Air Asia is the way to go.,0
2012,We travelled from Sydney to KL to Bandung and a few days later from Bandung to Denpasar. We were very satisfied with all aspects of the trip. We had paid for a meal on the Sydney to KL leg of our journey and the food was of good quality and enjoyable.,0
2012,Paid for allocated seats to Phuket at the cost of $150 received confirmation of these seats on boarding they just shrugged their shoulders and said the seats are already occupied. Not good enough spoke to customer service on our return and can not refund this is most unacceptable they have taken $150 from us and we did not receive what we paid for other then this service was good.,0
2012,KUL-HKT-KUL. Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour due to late arrival of the plane as well as technical issues. Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that. We got excellent value for money because we booked these tickets about a year ahead at one of the sale promotions (Fare was US$ 45 return).,0
2012,SYD-KUL then KUL-SYD. Paid for full premium seats plus meals. Before leaving Sydney I called Air Asia to purchase my inflight entertainment and was advised that due to my seat being a premium seat it came as a package. As expected was not the case when I got on the plane! Disappointing 8 hrs! For the flight back I was advised that there were no entertainment units left to pre-purchase and every plane was only allocated 10! I can see value in economy but not in premium/business class.,1
2012,We flew from Sydney to Bangkok and then from Phuket to Sydney. Staff were so rude and were unable to answer any questions. There was no inflight entertainment. If you wanted entertainment you had to pay extra for e-books. However there were none available on our flight. Even people who had pre-booked them couldn't get them because they were out. There were 3 of us travelling and we did not get seated together even though we checked in together. A family on our flight were also separated. Our flights were delayed also. I will never fly them again. Pay the extra money and go with another company.,1
2012,Another round trip from CNX to KUL. Once you know how to 'play' low cost airlines they do offer good value for money (but not always). The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry. FA's need to be more strict (politely of course) with pax who get ready to get off long before the aircraft reaches the gate.,0
2012,Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur then Kuala Lumpur to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh) then back from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur and home again to Melbourne. I have flown Air Asia X and standard Air Asia many times now and am always more than happy with their service. Not only were all flights on time (I have never had a delayed Air Asia flight) however all flights also arrived at their destinations early! Food and Beverages onboard are fantastic (We pre-booked meals which aren't expensive) and all onboard staff were friendly and more than helpful. I could not speak more highly of Air Asia and for a budget airline. Highly recommend for the budget costs great service on-time performance and onboard comfort.,0
2012,CNX-KUL. I've never used a low cost airline before but the alternative on this route involved a transit in BKK so I took Air Asia for convenience more than anything else. While the bag drop was slow and the food not that good the service was fine as was the aircraft a fairly new looking A320-200. The seat was comfortable enough for a 2hr 20min flight! The flight arrived just about on time and I was through the low cost terminal in 20min; I picked a seat paid for a 25kg bag and had food. The cost still came in 65% less than the other options on this route so no complaints and I would use again for convenience.,0
2012,We travel KUL-MEL almost once a month for business. Not happy with the booking system as it tries to sell you everything from Hot Seats to Baggage to Insurance etc. and every time we book we have to be careful to delete all these items as it gives you Hot seats to charge you more. Other airlines leave it to you to add on items you wan to purchase and this is more practical. They should make their booking system more User Friendly! Punctuality is ok and they have improved a lot over the years. Most of the staff are friendly.,0
2012,My family and I flew BKK-KUL KUL-SYD. Awful experience staff were rude no attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers.,1
2012,Flew JOG-KUL-RGN. Do not spend money on hot seat or pick a seat. Since boarding announcements are in local language first passengers rushed to the gates especially in small airports where there is not a dedicated line for hot seat passengers. When I asked staff at gate if everyone had hot seats they said yes! Pay for hot seats if you want bulk head or emergency exit seats for leg room. At end of purchase the website will give you seat assignments so don't bother paying for pick a seat either. Airplane and attendants are average for low cost carriers.,0
2012,CNX-KUL return. As I seldom have checked baggage using the stand alone machines for check-in is a breeze especially as most people don't use them! Flight itself was fine although it was a confusing route march to get to the aircraft. Also having a flight to Chennai at roughly the same time seemed to confuse some passenger. Reasonable cabin crew. I ordered meals in advance and they were onboard although I was listed as a 'no-show' on the manifest. Return to CNX the breakfast pancakes were cold and trying to get the packet of maple syrup open was like a challenge from a game show. Flights were punctual and the return 25 minutes early.,0
2012,SYD-KUL-SYD. A day flight so no reclined seats from the passenger in front. The space between seats was surprisingly decent. Food is average. The airport LCCT - what a sham. Cabin crew were ok. Cost me AUD$660 return. Fully recommended keeping an open mind about the size of the seats and the organisation of the poor airport facilities.,0
2012,This is a bad bus service. On my travel BKK-CCU the check-in lines were ridiculous with attendants weighing every piece of baggage. Not sure if the web check-in works as I still had to stand in a long line for over 75 minutes to hand in baggage. The flight itself was fine seats seemed like they were for kids. Attendants seem inexperienced and lack manners.,1
2012,BKK-HKT return and KUL-JOG DPS-KUL and liked their modern fleet punctuality and cabin comfort. What I dislike is their online-booking system that tries to sell various add-ons that may or may not be useful. This also results in the prices not being transparent and I ended up paying more than anticipated.,0
2012,Day trip SIN-KUL on relatively new aircraft. Given the short distance AirAsia is definitely worth the value paid. Uses Terminal 1 at SIN but LCCT at KL is not the best.,0
2012,Our flight KUL-SGN was forced to return due to a tropical Storm in SGN. That was unavoidable so we accepted that we had no choice. However on return to the LCCT the absence of senior staff and the overall treatment of all passengers was appalling. Passengers were left to fend for themselves and there was a disgraceful lack of communication My wife and I had to make our own way through Immigration to try to find a hotel room. Staff seemed confused and leaderless.,1
2012,Good cheap airline. Seats quite close together but ok for short flight. Staff polite and helpful. It offers very cheap fights within Asia and you can pre-book extra weight luggage at very a reasonable price. Have used this airline on numerous different flights and they have always been reliable. This is the first time I have landed at LCCT in KUL - ladies loos very dirty. Chaotic but not too bad luggage didn't take too long to arrive.,0
2012,BKK-KUL KUL-HKT BKK-HKT. Had booked for my girlfriend and myself to fly from BKK-HKT but had to change plans and flew BKK-KUL and KUL-HKT later on. Fast check-in at Suvarnabhumi at self-check-in terminals but extremely slow baggage drop-off! Flights were acceptable considering the reasonably low prices. No attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers.,1
2012,KUL-Yogyakarta. Easy access to LCCT airport by Skybus and other cheaper options from KL Sentral station. No hassles checking in - perhaps it was a quiet morning. Onboard clean newish Airbus with helpful young cabin crew. Food and drinks sold were very good and well priced especially the Nasi Chicken Biryani.,0
2012,TSN-KUL. Left and arrived over 30 minutes early. Inflight meal was lovely. KUL-OOL - left early but held up on tarmac. No inflight service used. Seating configuration 3-3-3. Believe seats were narrower aisles definitely narrower and unsure if leg room was less. Check-in was prompt and courteous with no wait for luggage. Found cabins a little cool so need a coat or blanket on long haul. LCCC has everything required but don't expect a top international terminal and credit cards were not taken.,0
2012,KUL-MEL-KUL and KUL-LGW. The cabin is clean and modern the staff friendly attentive and do an excellent job. Food was ok - reasonably priced and sufficient. The toilets were reasonably clean even on long flight to London from KUL. All flights on time. Generally very happy with the service shame they've stopped flying to the UK! If flying long haul make sure you take some entertainment.,0
2012,"LGK-SIN. No frills as expected aircraft was clean service efficient flight delayed 30 minutes but made up some time in its turnaround at LGK. A320 seats were rather cramped with minimal legroom for an average sized ""westerner"". Some English cabin announcements were very difficult to understand.",0
2012,Have been flying Air Asia for 5 years and now only when I have to. A discount airline but prices keep going up. Seats are narrow and all the advertising inside the cabin reminds me of a bus not an airline.,1
2012,KUL-CNX. After an excellent flight on Air Asia X from LGW I carried on to Chaing Mai with Air Asia. Standard AA experience especially when compared to the likes of Ryanair in Europe. I had an email several weeks before departure saying that my meal choice was being discontinued and quoted the substitute meal which was quite tast). My only criticism is the website and how one has to be careful not to book something you don't want as I have just done. On the next outbound leg I changed the baggage allowance to no bags but missed it on the return so I have an allowance but no bags!,0
2012,I flew from Phuket to Perth and need not have worried. Flights were on time the aircraft excellent great cabin staff and the food I ordered was quite acceptable for the price. The seating was fine and no different to a full fare airline. Would rate it as one of the most comfortable flights I have taken.,0
2012,Singapore to Bangkok. The rows of seats were very close together and seemed narrower than other airlines. Nothing was free or included in the fare not even water. They not only weighed my checked bag but weighed my carry-on. The flight itself was very smooth. I would definitely fly Air Asia again although admittedly it wouldn't be my first choice.,0
2012,SIN-BKI-SIN Great value for money flying Air Asia from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu and return. On time both ways. Clean cabins good leather seats efficient young fresh attitude staff friendly and helpful. Felt good on the planes. Like colors interior/exterior of planes.,0
2012,My wife and I flew from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. We were pleasantly surprised how good this low cost airline is. Aircraft is pretty new neat and clean; crew friendly helpful and efficient. Check-in agents at both Singapore and KL were nice and efficient. Nothing was free onboard we bought bottle water and a sandwich. Prices were reasonable. The Low Cost Carrier Terminal took a bit to get used but we had no problem getting help with immigration customs and transportation to city proper. An airline of value!,0
2012,CNX-KUL and PEN-BKK. For the price and bearing in mind this is a low cost carrier then very good. Pre-ordered food on CNX-KUL arrived without hitch - as did flights and luggage. Delay ex PEN due to storm but part made up despite flight being only 1hr 15mins. Seats are a little cramped but to be expected and overall a very good product. Crews all good and despite full loads relaxed and charming.,0
2012,"Bangkok-Chiang Mai Chiang Mai-Phuket Krabi-Bangkok. Tickets were considerably cheaper than similar options with competing airlines. Check-in was quick and efficient in all cases. You don't get any food or drinks. This being said service was good and efficient. For tall Europeans I would recommend you pay 10 USD extra and get extra legroom in the ""hot seats"". The planes were new and seats comfortable. Luggage arrived very quickly except on the last leg of our journey.",0
2012,MEL-KUL KUL-CMB return. One flight cancelled before the travel date however I was given the option to change all flights without additional cost. Surprised by good service although food quality could improve. Value for money. Only real negative is the high price for picking seats ($25n MEL-KL ).,0
2012,BKK-Penang return. Asked and paid for assistance as have problems walking and needed a wheelchair. Had a chair on the outward trip as far as the bus then left to struggle on and off the bus on my own and to climb up to the aircraft. At Penang Airport had chair but had to walk up 2 flights of steps. The return was not too bad till got to Bangkok - no chair waiting the air hostess tried to ring for a chair but nobody answered the phone. Had to walk whole way through the airport with great difficulty and then collect my luggage. By the time I got to arrivals to meet my daughter I could hardly walk and was in a great deal of pain. Will never travel Air Asia again alone.,1
2012,SIN-KUL. After flying around Europe with Ryanair and easyjet the service of AirAsia feels better FA's were more caring. 6 seats across in B737 the leg room is tight even for an Asian who is 1.78m tall. For just under an hour flight this was tolerable.,0
2012,DPS-PER (Indonesia Air Asia) - hard to find fault the plane was clean flight was on time prepaid meal was small but delicious. I paid $117 just 3 weeks before including baggage meal and extra leg room - less than I paid for an internal flight in Indonesia. The only thing I would suggest is they could accept credit card payment in-flight at least for duty free purchases.,0
2012,Perth to KUL. My elderly mother paid extra to travel premium economy - what a waste! On both flights ground staff did not give priority boarding to premium economy passengers - everyone just barged on to the aircraft without a care for anyone else. Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight. No sign of any compensation nothing but a note in the email to say that we hope it won't inconvenience you in any way!,1
2012,Three flights Kolkata (CAL) to BBK and BBK-CNX return. All flights comfortable and with one exception on time. Air Asia's offer is basic but good. The seats are reasonably comfortable and better than many budget airlines. Having flown Air Asia for many years I notice the staff are not as enthusiastic as in the early days nor do they have time to interact with passengers. I wish the company would enforce their 'one carry-on bag' policy. Some passengers on one flight had up to four large bags. What's the point in having the policy if it's not enforced.,0
2012,KL to Chiang Mai and back. The trip was reasonably good the seats were comfortable for the short flight the meals where also quite good I had a nasi lemak and then spaghetti for the return flight. Overall it was good value for money and I would definitely recommend it.,0
2012,SIN-CNX-SIN. Good value for money. New A320-200 both ways. All flights on time. Aircraft clean spacious. Load only 50%. No IFE. FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg. When purchase ticket one has to be careful not to be trapped purchasing expensive seating and superfluous insurance.,0
2012,Flights from Perth-KL then KL to Bangkok return. 4 flights 1 was fantastic. The rest were very disappointing. Even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets. We were subject to 'attitude' from staff when we complained about the chewing gum over our table dried vomit over the back of the seats in front of us and the accompanying smell. We were eventually moved. A toilet door broke because it wouldn't shut people sitting adjacent had to put up with the chemical smell. Our pre-ordered meals weren't served to us.,1
2012,We flew Christchurch to KL return and KL to Kota Bharu return. We found them very good. All flights were on time. The service was good. The food and beverages were reasonably priced and tasty. I would recommend due to the good value.,0
2012,Fully satisfied in the past however my last two trips were awful. Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure. This has now happened to me a few times in the past when there was separate check-in counters there were no issue.,1
2012,The night before I flew from CNX I spent a good half an hour checking-in via the web for my flight. On arrival at CNX they had 3 flights departing at approximately the same time and only 3 check-in desks open. There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG. All the planes I have flown are exceptionally clean and look and feel new however I regret that Air Asia is loosing its credibility and its novelty is wearing mighty thin.,1
2012,KUL (LCCT)-LGK (Langkawi) return. AirAsia's Terminal is basic but efficient as are the staff. Both flights were smooth in A320s that looked brand new. For both flights we had seats in row 2 where space seemed bigger than other rows behind but ok for a 50 minute flight. Staff were friendly and the captain's announcements were clear and professional. I can only recommend them.,0
2012,SIN-KUL-VTE return all flights on A320. The flights were okay but not clean though. There was gum in my seat pocket. Crew members were pleasant on all flights except one on the VTE-KUL route.,0
2011,Onboard my seat was musty and dirty. I had already ordered food online and when I received the 'Chef and Crew's choice' dish it was cold and soggy. Thank goodness the price is reasonable or else I would lodge a complaint.,1
2011,KBV-BKK on A320. Flight on time bags a bit delayed its always the case in Bangkok. All in all quite a pleasant flight.,0
2011,KUL-PEN roundtrip on 25-26 December. A pleasant trip especially on the return leg. Aircraft was clean and stewardess friendly. The return trip was better as staff were more friendly and hospitable. Did not buy any drinks or food because it was a short flight. Overall a good trip and will fly them again if the price is good.,0
2011,Flew one-way KUL-LGW and managed to get standby upgrade from economy to Premium via the Optiontown service. Though notification of successful upgrade only came through via email some 8 hours before the flight. Not best but for the low price it was worth it. 14 hrs flight to LGW was fine. Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine. Will fly Air Asia X again in future.,0
2011,HKT-CNX. Comfortable flight only marred by a group of unruly passengers. Thai crew unable to control them but then who could? Flight on time and thankfully shorter than advertised. New and clean plane with leather seating. All in all a decent experience will fly them again.,0
2011,Round trip Bangkok to Chiang Mai. The problems started trying to book the flight online. A truly painful process and ended up a much more costly experience than first expected with extras and charges you even have to pay for choosing a seat. As for the flights outwards was fine but all I can say on the return leg is - if the company uses the same guidelines of employing non customer facing staff as they do with the customer facing staff then disaster is only a matter of time.,1
2011,MFM-BKK-HKT. Check-in was easy as I had prepaid for my luggage however I was unable to transfer my baggage at BKK and had to re-check my baggage. Flight was 30 mins delayed with very little updates. Once boarded the service was very professional and efficient. I had pre-ordered meals on both legs meals are quite cheap on the website however if you are hungry I would recommend having two meals.,0
2011,TAA has re-timed their CNX-SIN flight and this is much better although it is a late arrival in CNX on the return sector. My flight to SIN was slightly early but the return was almost 30 mins early into CNX arriving at 2235 instead of 2300. Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer. All in all I'm starting to warm to their Changi service after an indifferent start in January.,0
2011,DEL-BKK-DEL with AirAsia. I got promo fares of 7000 rupees aircraft was good and flight was good. Also seats comfortable. I enjoyed vegetable briyani and it was delicious.,0
2011,Shopping around I found that there was an excellent promotion fare with TAA from SIN to CNX. I used this service on day one in January and hoped that they could at least get it back to CNX on time. The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.,0
2011,RGN-BKK-RGN. Check in at Yangon International Airport hassle free. Flight call by seat boarding fine greeted by smiles and seated behind the emergency exit row. Landed at Bangkok on time and was first to receive baggage. Check in at Bangkok was okay but not as good as Yangon.,0
2011,BKK to Hat Yai (HDY) and noticed service deterioration. Flight retimed one month in advance and cause me minor itinerary problem (despite their offer to change to earlier or later flight). Only one Bag drop counter for internet/ Kiosk check in opened. Their advertisement that internet check in is quicker and hassle - free is totally untrue. Once on board A320 aircraft is new and clean but seat pitch is a very tight. Aptitude of the crew does not seemed to be as good as their earlier year. My friend who sit upfront tried to purchase chicken rice and was told that only curry is available but I was told later that I can only get chicken rice because my curry is finished.,1
2011,Took the inaugural flight from Chiang Mai to Singapore. To say it was just another flight would be an understatement. And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around. Having done PR for major events including such new services I was sorely disappointed. Frankly Thai Ai Asia's product is far below that of its big brother in Malaysia and it shows.,0
2011,"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.",1
2011,HKT-BKK. Paid for 20Kgs of baggage on their scales at Phuket my case weighed 19.2kgs. 3 hours later the same bag (nothing taken out) weighed in at 16.8Kgs on Qatar Airways scales at BKK. Not the first time I have noticed such a discrepancy. Good value flight though promo ticket with baggage and taxes was around 20GB.,0
2010,CGK-HKT. The flights were on time aircraft very clean and well-maintained and service was very friendly and professional. I paid a small supplement for one of the 'hotseats' and it was well worth it. The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket. Their regular fares are often only a bit cheaper than other carriers.,0
2010,Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. Very nice journey nice crew and leather seats in airplane. Very easy to book. If you book place near window (right side) you will see nice view to Thai islands for example Ko Samui.,0
2010,BKK-CAN and HKG-BKK. My first experience of Thailand's division of Air Asia. Good value for money and only a few observations. Having paid for a 'hot seat' the priority boarding in BKK was only to the bus not the plane. There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off. Flights on-time and one of the aircraft was virtually brand new. If the price is right this is the way to go but they are not always the cheapest option especially to Hong Kong where competition is fierce with a multitude of third country carriers flying that route.,0
2010,BKK - Phnom Penh - BKK Checked in online 24hours in advance which was very convenient and got seats allocated together Airport baggage drop very quick and efficient. Flight departed 15minutes early and arrived 25minutes early. seats comfortable legroom ok for a lo-cost carrier. baggage very quick on arrival. Return journey checked in at the desk very quick and efficient. Although flight was only 1/3 full we didn't get seated together and were put across the aisle from each other despite the two seats next to me where empty. Flight on time and arrived early baggage again very quick.,0
2010,Bangkok - Yangon - Bangkok. I bought the ticket on internet. The process was a bit time consuming as I had to click through many pages. The 48 hours web check in was very convenient as I could check in on both flights. But still I had to go to the check-in counter at the airport for document check. Check in at Bangkok was long. I only had a handbag and I was directed to a counter for that purpose. Service was good. I am 1.81 and found the seat spacing adequate. There was a wide variety of food options which could be ordered when the ticket was purchased. Cabin staff professional and friendly on both flights. My only complaint is that on the return flight a PRM (Person with Reduced Mobility) was seated between me and the aisle (I had a window seat). I don't think this is legal and it caused discomfort for the other person.,0
2016,"Manila to Siem Reap with Cebu Pacific. I have flown on this airline over a dozen times, and they are late every single time. The only thing they will give free is water. I asked for some hot water because I wasn't feeling well they would not give it to me if I didn't pay. Horrible airline, absolutely late every time.",1
2016,"Hong Kong to Manila. Cebu Pacific doesn't have staff that properly handle passenger complaints and it has poor ground service. During boarding, a friend of mine was rudely told by a flight attendant not to stow his small carry on in the designated place below his front seat because an old lady in front put her bag below the seat. My friend tried to explain that he had very small room in the already cramped seating, but the flight attendant never offered to assist my friend nor assist the old lady in putting up her luggage to free up my friends legroom. The staff seem to have no proper training in handling customers especially with legitimate complaints as they shrug it off as 'just a very little problem'. After a cooling of heads and apologies were finally given, we were greeted with another 30 minute delay in baggage claim to end our Cebu Pacific experience.  If you think the 25-100USD price difference is worth the risk of any or all the above mentioned happening to you, then go ahead and book. However, after several average (mostly delayed) flights with them before and this last terrible one, I would avoid this airline.",1
2016,"The long and short of the ""Cebu Pacific Experience"" can be summed up into: 1) Massive delays 2) Rude and improperly trained staff and 3) Poor ground baggage claim service. This low cost carrier's delays used to be just their main problem during the previous years I've flown them. However, flight comfort, very poor in-flight staff training and their system for baggage claim in my most recent flight leads me to make this my last ever booking with them. The HKG-MNL flight I was on left almost an hour late. The flight attendants were very rude and did not offer any help to assist my friend whose legroom was taken by a bag that was placed by the passenger in front of him under the seat, nor did they offer any help to fix the situation to make both my 6'1 tall friend's legroom and putting the front passenger's bag in an overhead storage. As we arrived close to 40 minutes late in Manila, we aired our concern to the lead flight attendant after all passengers left only to be rudely said that it was (having my 6'1 friends legroom reduced by a blocking bag) as a very small deal. After apologies were finally made, we were then greeted by yet another 30-40 minute delay in our baggage claim. If the 25-75 dollar addition is not a big deal, I would really advise you avoid this airline than having one (or all in my case) of these deplorable instances happening to you. The saving that you get is, in my opinion and by many others I've read here, not worth the stress.",1
2016,"Zamboanga to Cebu with Cebu Pacific. This airline is always delayed. It is delayed so often that they should just change all of the flight times to account for the delays. Additionally, their website is setup so that there are several extra charges added if you are not paying attention (food, insurance, donations). I would not recommend this airline unless you have all day to take a one hour flight.",1
2016,"Manila to Sydney. You get exactly what you pay for. A horrible Check in experience, the flight was full so about 400+ people wanting to check in at the same time, however I only had hand luggage and had to queue with everyone regardless of checking in online and only having cabin baggage which is a painfully awful service to receive. Cebu Pacific has one class which is economy so the aircraft is like a bus with a 3x3x3 seat configuration, thinning at the back of the aircraft to 2x3x2 - the seats were very uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight! The cabin staff are distinctly average, with a really dated uniform and no IFE (which was expected). Overall I would use this airline again purely as the flight was ridiculously cheap in a sale. However this airline could learn a lot from their long haul competitors AirAsia X.",0
2016,"Doha to Manila with Cebu Pacific. Nice budget airline from point to point. My first long haul flight on a no frill airline which didnt disappoint me. Its a unique 3x3x3 seat configuration A330 which normally is 2x4x2. No screen and entertainment, but I bring my own. The pre ordered meal wasn't great but for the price one could appreciate the same. Overall a pleasant flying experience and flying again in three months.",0
2016,"Manila to Caticlan. I agree with many customers they said long time ago Cebu Pacific was a good airline, but nowadays more and more troubles.  Our flight Manila to Caticlan DG 6241 was cancelled, said we'll get next DG 6243 flight 2hours later, but this one cancelled too - instead we got a 5.5 hrs later flight to Kalibo instead booked flight to Caticlan, which is more inconvenient for us to go to Boracay, and its a cheaper flight too. We reached the island at 11pm, half day holiday was lost. We wanted a refund amount, because flights to Kalibo are more cheaper, but the customer service wrote: Our flight disruption policy only includes, rebooking within 30 days without charges, full travel fund, or full refund. We cannot do both at the same time. And this seems to happens often. So they sell many more expensive flights at good day times, cancel and change this flights and if you have to take another (cheaper) flight the same day, you don't get a cash refund. This is an unfair customer treatment, even I would say an unjustified income for Cebu Pacific. I only can advise people, if they can afford, to take an even more expensive but hassel free flight with another company.",1
2016,"Bangkok to Manila. FAs at Cebu Pacific are generally nice and smiling. However, during this flight, my husband ordered a warm meal that the FA advised to have a 20-minute-preparation time. Almost an hour later, nothing was served. When we followed up, the crew in fact forgot about it. She apologized and provided us a complimentary sandwich. Food is not good at all with Cebu Pacific, so better bring your own in the aircraft. The croissant sandwich was not a croissant but just a white bread shaped like a croissant and it was not worth the calorie or the price. But I like the aircraft for its staff who are often very nice.",0
2016,"Laoag to Manila with Cebu Pacific. Flight was late, so instead of a 6.05 pm departure the flight departed at 9.30 pm. This due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Laoag is a small airport with minimal facilities so the free McDonalds meal provided by ground staff was welcomed. ATR aircraft seemed brand new with a comfortable seat and clean cabin. Cabin crew were friendly but no catering offered on board. Couldn't work out if this was because we had been provided a meal at the airport or due to anticipated turbulence. No announcements from the flightdeck apart from requesting cabin crew to take their seats. Ramp disembarkment at Manila and quite a walk to the arrivals entrance in the rain. Each passenger was provided an umbrella upon leaving the aircraft which I thought was a good idea. Returned to staff at the arrivals building. All in all, although they need to improve their punctuality, it was a pleasant enough experience. Because I booked about a month in advance, the air fare was extremely good value and I would fly with them again.",0
2016,Manila to Busuanga with Cebu Pacific. Twin prop aircraft. Massive delays. Poor communucation not telling customers about delay or how long. Flights eventually cancelled. This airline is really poor. I wouldn't recommend Cebu Pacific. Will pay a little more for less stress and to know I will get where I need to at the time I need to. Seat comfort in the end was woeful.,1
2016,"Manila to General Santos, unfortunately, I travelled 6 times with Cebu Pacific this summer and all flights have been almost 4 hours late. No apologies and no action from the airline. Today, the flight time was meant to be 10.00am and no one can tell us how long will be waiting time. They told us the plane will be ready at 11.25, now already telling us that it is expected to reach the terminal at 12.45.",1
2016,"I have flown with Cebu Pacific at least 10 times (that was 10 times too many). They are rarely on-time. Flights are frequently cancelled, mostly delayed by several hours, often re-routed. In my last case, all of the above. Initial flight from Davao to Singapore was cancelled. Rescheduled flight was delayed and then re-routed. Ironically, my perception of the airline is so low, I was relieved I arrived at my final destination only 4-hours late. If you have lots of time and patience and no connecting flight, they are ok. Otherwise, avoid. The money saved is not worth it.",1
2016,"Puerto Princesa to Manila - I travel frequently through Cebu Pacific. This airlines always boasts about their on time schedules. Unfortunately, most of my flights with CEB are delayed. The airline staff are always announcing that the cause of the delay is the air traffic congestion at the Manila International Airport but for me most of the flights I have been on are the airline's fault. Most of the flights that are delayed are noon to evening flights given that its also peak time for Manila Airport but CEB staff are sometimes not very accommodating and fail to update its passengers about what is happening or what is the cause of the delay. Most of the time, they use gates 131-132 at T3 which means that you have to take a shuttle bus that will lead you to the planes instead of using the air bridge. On this part, CEB is weak but I will still fly CEB because of their new planes and cool games on board.",0
2016,"Kalibo to Hong Kong via Manila with Cenu Pacific. Delayed 5 hours on a flight with an average running time of 45 minutes. I've been on the road because of their incompetence for 13 hours from Borocay to Hong Kong. Everything else on the journey was incredibly unqualified, from airport facilities to air service to crisis management and just the ground crew kindness was outstanding. The plane itself was miserable, tattered and taped panels and leaking air con vents right over me and in other places too. Even luggage delivery in Hong Kong was delayed and that has never happened to me before in such an efficient airport. The delay is fully on charge of management incompetence since there was no environmental situation forcing such delay but just unavailable parking in Manila, according to crew explanation. This definitely was overall the worst trip I ever had in my 20 years traveling.",1
2016,"Reading many of the reviews I must be one of the luckiest travellers. Three Cebu Pacific flights in the last few months all MNL-DVO-MNL and all close to time with no dramas. This particular Manila to Davao flight was so empty, it was not how many spare seats but how many spare rows! For the money paid I remain very satisfied with this airline.",0
2016,"Woeful. This is a tricky review. We tried to travel on this airline twice, but one of the flights was cancelled, so this review is for the flight we did take, plus the service around the one we didn't. 1st flight (the cancelled one) - Manila to Caticlan (Boracay) 4 June. Arrived at the domestic airport more than 2 hrs before flight knowing Manila airport is a shocker, and wanted to make sure we allowed plenty of time. Joined a slow moving check in queue, wondering why our flight number wasn't displayed. At exactly 2 hrs before flight departure, a garbled voice announced over the PA ""Cebu flight DG6243 to Caticlan is cancelled"". This was both amusing and worrying, not just cancelled but definitely cancelled ? This was the first we'd heard of it. I happened to look at my phone and lo and behold, a helpful email at the same time alerts me to the cancellation as well. Made it to the front of the queue to be told to join another queue to organise another Cebu Pacific flight. Spending more time at Manila airport than necessary was not appealing, so decided to book another carrier and get a refund from Cebu instead. Misinformation and delays ensued. Ticket office to get refund located outside the terminal, and knowing our new flight would be closing in 30 mins, and stringent security to get back into the terminal, decided to lodge refund request by phone instead. Did this on 5 June, it was approved, and were told it would take a week. Two weeks later still waiting.  2nd Flight - Caticlan to Manila 10 June. Quick checkin this time, though for some reason it took 4 staff to do it ? All giggling and having a great time. Asked if we had a connecting flight from Manila (that should have been a dead giveaway, more later), told them yes, but in 6 hours. Bit of Spanish and more giggling ensued. Boarding passes given, which was a relief. Went upstairs to the waiting lounge and watched our flight go from On Time to Delayed before our eyes, as were all following flights. To be fair, the delay was caused by air traffic in Manila, but would have appreciated to be told at checkin. Flight ended up being only 45 mins delayed, and when the heavens opened, Cebu ground staff gave us umbrellas to walk across the tarmac. I'd booked seats in row 3 looking for a quick getaway, but of course, this particular plane only allowed boarding and disembarkation from the back! Service on board was pretty much non-existent due to the short 1 hr trip, which was fine by me. My hubby's seat was so old he had a steel rod poking him in the back, so he was bolt upright the whole time. The people in row 1 were sitting backwards, facing the people in row 2, never seen anything like it!  Avoid if you can. We booked Skyjet as our alternate carrier to Caticlan and they were brilliant. Pricier, but at least we got a plane!",1
2016,"Did a round trip with Cebu Pacific, Davao - Cebu - Davao. The trip was on time in both directions. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The fare was great value. I would fly with them again. If I did have any complaints it would have been checking in at Davao. It was a shambles, however we managed to board on time.",0
2016,"Hong Kong to Manila with Cebu Pacific. It's not only on flights that they fail royally but also on loyalty programs.  I flew on emergency to Manila via Hong Kong. So I didn't have the time to update my GetGo membership number in the booking I made the same day of my flight. I tried using the missing point claim option they have in their website but it rejected my request so I wrote to them. I received a reply that they will credit my missing points within 3 weeks. It's been more than a month now since getting that reply and still the points are missing. On each follow-up email I sent, they keep on sending me templatized apologies and no genuine action is being done. Is it rocket science to credit unclaimed points really? And oh, that membership doesn't come free unlike with other airlines, you have to pay a fee. And yet they rob you of your rights. Beware of this airline.",1
2016,I had my worst experience with this airline. I was booked from Manila to Cebu on 4/4/16 at 2300. My flight from Japan to Manila landed at 2200 instead of 2055 that night. I had to claim my baggage and I reached at the Cebu Pacific check in counter at 2230. The lady in the counter told me to rebook my ticket. I explained to her that it is not my fault that I was delayed and asked her to let me fly at their 2330 flight. She told me no and the staff in the ticketing counter told me to pay 4900 in addition to what I already paid. Another passenger told me that Cebu Pacific asked 8000 on a 1-way flight that night. It shocked me how heartless and cruel this airline is. They took advantage of the poor people in dire need of getting home that night. I swore not to get a ticket at Cebu Pacific and found a 5680 ticket at PAL.  I wasted more money that night for the hotel and the taxi that I booked to stay and to fetch me in Cebu without me. I also noticed that Cebu Pacific advertized a lower cost but you end up paying more with hidden fees.  I put 1 star for the rating which means zero to me since there was no option given for the zero.,1
2016,"If you have plenty of time and patience then go for Cebu Pacific, otherwise I wouldn't recommend them to anybody. Our flight was 2.5 hours late so we missed our next flight even though we originally would have 3.5 hours between transit. There was almost no information given in the airport and the staff told os both in Puerta Princesa and in Manila that they would contact our connecting flight, which they never did. Staff was not helpful at all in the airport when we needled to quickly be transported from terminal 3 to 1. We heard from many other travelers that this is normal and that they frequently cancel flight if the planes don't get filled up. You get what you pay for.",1
2016,"Singapore to Manila and Cebu Pacific is typical budget airline with narrow legroom and packed planes. Well, you get what you pay for and yes, it is affordable. As single male passenger flying without luggage I convinced the check in staff to get me an emergency row seat, which has far better legroom, so it was good. Service was ok, timely departure, on time arrival.",0
2016,"Cebu Pacific is a typical budget airline: low fares and a competitor for flights in and around Philippines. But you get nothing, just a seat. Anything else you want you pay extra. International flight allow you to bring 23-30 kg of luggage. Cebu max is 20kg, so you need to pay! If there's a delay there is no information! All together, you need this airline to get on the right spot in Philippines but if you can avoid it, do it!",1
2016,"This was a disaster. We were stranded in Coron for 24 hours due to mechanical issues. The real problem was that the staff made no effort to help the passengers or give us any information. At first they tried to assure us that the plane was just delayed a bit, but when the later flights started leaving and we were still stuck, everyone started to line up for answers. The staff hid. One guy was ill and needed to get to a hospital, while many others had onward flights in Manila, and still the staff hung around, doing nothing. By the following day, most people gave up and got flights on Philippines Airlines. We are still fighting to get reimbursed for the flight that never happened, but I'm not counting on that happening any time soon. Best to avoid Cebu Pacific if you have any other options at all.",1
2016,"Manila to Cebu, and I recommend not to fly with Cebu Pecific. It is totally unreliable. I had a massive delay without any information whatsoever. The staff was hiding, the ground crew gave no information on the nature and the time of the delay. I recommend to use other local carriers for domestic flights.",1
2016,"I fly budget several times a year with AirAsia, Jetstar, EasyJet, Ryanair, etc. Cebu Pacific is by far the worst. I booked 4 flights with them, 3 of which were significantly delayed and the fourth from Puerto Princesa to Manila was cancelled. The boarding process is frustratingly disorganised and very slow and the customer service is non-existent. The cancelled flight was not explained, we were offered a different flight more than 24 hours later but this would've caused us to miss our connection so we opted for a full refund, which I have not received more than a month later. I have spoken to the airline and they say they have refunded me already, they have not. Don't be taken in by the low prices with this airline, fly with somebody else and pay whatever extra you have to.",1

On 17/01/2016 at 2342 received notification of a cancellation due to maintenance of the aircraft, without offering any alternative arrangements. Told to contact customer service or go to their airport office. The customer service agent was absolutely indifferent to the inconvenience caused by the cancellation and the proposed rebooking on another flight from Manila to Kalibo, about 80km from Caticlan. At check in there was a line of about 40 passengers - staff were efficient but not polite. Boarding slow and laborious and delayed departure by about 30-minutes.

Contacted customer service but whatever the choice, I was referred back to the manage my booking system where it turns out that, even without accepting the rebooking Cebu Pacific has already confirmed the new flights. Flight on time but a company to avoid.",1
2016,Cebu Pacific flight 150 on 28/1/2016 at 07.05. The only flight that was not cancelled of the three booked with Cebu Pacific in January 2016. Check in was quick with efficient staff. Fast boarding and departing on time. Aircraft clean with efficient staff. Seat a little bit small for people taller than 180cm.,1
2016,"Cebu Pacific never fails to disappoint me. Tuguegarao to Manila is only served by Cebu and PAL. PAL was fully booked so I did not have a choice. The aircraft arrived late, probably 30 minutes before boarding. Although this was a domestic flight, 30 mins was definitely not enough turn around time. A very superficial apology that the flight was going to be delayed was offered. Delays seem to be a norm - I flew from HKG to MNL 3 days before this flight and it was delayed for nearly 3 hours. Time is very important to everyone. The fares are not cheap either - charging full service fares for an ultra-low cost service.",1
2016,"Hong Kong to Manila with Cebu Pacific - low cost, low quality. You definitely get what you pay for. Christmas season is the busiest time in the year to travel and had no other optios but Cebu on the date and time I had to leave Hong Kong. I have flown with them in the past and this flight it was like a deja vu. The aircraft coming from MNL arrived 2 hours late. None of the staff at their check in counters knew what was going on, and didn't mention the delay when I was checking in. I could have spent an extra two hours with my friend who took me to the airport. Second, when we were inside the aircraft, we were delayed for another 35 minutes. I must commend the friendly cabin crew who profusely apologised. Their customer service skills were good. I did not eat the food offered - it looked more like a ration. When we arrived in MNL, the air bridge was not working, so we all had to go down the stairs to the tarmac and up to the stairs to get inside the airport. It was an unpleasant pre-Christmas flight. Cebu Pacific has to understand that although passengers are aware that they are operating low cost, they should be on time, improve the food, ad keep passenger comfort in mind.",1
2016,"Manila to Davao, on a Cebu Pacific A330. Seat configuration was all economy class in a 9-across (3-3-3) seat layout, and I had the last row by the window which was 2-3-2 config. Flight was boarded on time and despite being a busy flight, it flight left on time and arrived on time with great views from the clear sky. Flight price was cheap which was why I chose it but added advantage that everything went smoothly left a favourable impression of Cebu Pacific.",0
2016,"Cagayan de Oro to Manila on Cebu Pacific's all economy class A320. Flight arrived at Zhengzhou 20 minutes late, but the time was made up as they overstated their flights time - as usual. Flight was a no frills economy flight, but when I checked in they moved me to exit row seat which gave me a bit of extra legroom and also a nice view of the Philippines travelling from south to north. Arriving at terminal 3 and connecting with another Cebu Pacific flight allowed me to avoid the extreme hassle of changing terminals at Manila.",0
2016,"Manila to Singapore on Cebu Pacific's larger A330. Flight was busy and despite boarding on time the aircraft waited around the tarmac for 30 minutes due to usual Manila traffic. We arrived 30 mins late but that was more to do with Manila airport than Cebu Pacific. I was seated in row 3 which gives a bit extra legroom but being located toilet was bothersome. Flight was cheap and service was friendly and fun. Happy with the service and a fraction of the cost for the same service (minus a meal) compared with full service airlines. I also won a Cebu Pacific wash bag onboard the flight, quite a novelty!",0
2016,"The Cebu Pacific Manila to Kuala Lumpur flight rescheduled from 5.50 pm arrival at Kuala Lumpur to 12.35 midnight. The staff informed that they have email the changes of schedule through email, but we do not receive it. Can't they also send text to the cell phone to inform of the changes of time? Then, the flight delay and arrived at Kuala Lumpur at about 1.40 am. Also, the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Manila also delayed for about 2 hours. They need to improve of their flight arrangement, etc.",1
2015,"I flew Manila to Sydney return on Cebu Pacific's high density A330. The negatives. IFE is non-existent, no personal A/C vent, Pre-ordered meals are horrible, blankets for sale, you're not allowed to bring water on the plane from MNL but its okay from SYD.  I've read about it and knew what to expect.  Check-in agent in Manila was friendly. Seat pitch was good and I'm 6'0"" tall and large built. I still had enough legroom with my knees hardly touching the seat in front of me. In fact, it's much better than their A320's. I was also able to secure an entire 3-seat row to myself on both legs.  Service was friendly, both flights were on time with the MNL-SYD flight actually arriving 30 minutes ahead. If you're flying budget, just know what to expect. Otherwise, fly full service and pay the price.",0
2015,"Manila to Davao on Cebu Pacific. Both legs rescheduled three times, both flights left late allegedly due to congestion in Manila. Once in the air new clean aircraft and sufficient room for two hours on a low cost carrier. Much cheaper than the opposition. Most impressive was the speed of the baggage delivery in both Davao and Manila, up there with the best!",0
2015,"Manila to Bangkok round trip and Manila to Kota Kinabalu return. All flights on time. Good, efficient check-in at all airports. Pre-paid baggage  so no hassles. Usual fairly expensive and not very tempting food options, so I tend to take my own food. Excellent fares and good service in the cabin. Terminal 3 in Manila is getting busy now but Cebu Pacific is still preferable to Philippine Airlines on these regional routes.",0
2015,Same old problems on todays Cebu Pacific service to Caticlan Airport. Every day the airline cancels flights to Caticlan Airport which is the destination for Boracay island. Normally at least 2 flights one in the morning and one in the afternoon are cancelled. My flight was cancelled today. They re-route passengers to Kalibo airport and then on a bus to Catalan. The airline charges a premium to Caticlan Airport of 50% over the fares to Kalibo and this scam allows the airline to make more money on the route. The bus journey between the 2 airports is circa 2 unpleasant hours. How long before someone puts an end to this? You get what you pay for but on this route there is not much choice.,1
2015,"Unfortunately we bought a couple of Cebu Pacific flights when we were travelling in the Philippines and it is a nightmare. Flights are late (3 to 4 hours is normal), many of them cancelled, they re-route passengers to other airports and then send you by bus to your destination. Just madness after madness. This is not a serious airline.",1
2015,"Extremely unpleasant flight with Cebu Pacific from Manila to Sydney. Check-in lines slow and staff rude. We were not told we could not bring a water bottle onto the flight. We bought one after security but it was taken at the gate. Cebu Pacific should have informed us. Seats with no lumber support and no cushion, had to pay up to $30 AUD for a blanket. Advertising across the cabin. Was kept on the tarmac for an hour and a half so the air-con could be tested. It was turned off and we all sat in the heat for a good twenty minutes before they turned it on again. Drinks and food way too expensive. One small water bottle was about $4 AUD, but because our water had been taken at the gate we had to take it. Food was served cold and not tasty at all, despite the $10 price tag for one little bread roll. Could not pay by card; only cash. Attendants rude and obnoxious when I gave them the wrong cash by accident in a currency I did not understand. Toilet not cleaned for most the flight; suspicious water over the floor. No IFE.",1
2015,"Out of the latest 10 times I had to fly with Cebu Pacific, 9 of them had at least 1 hour delay. The staff constantly makes updates with delay after delay and you always hear the same thing ""out of airline control"". When you are delayed to for example Manila and you see Air Asia and PAL flying on time with ease and you had the bad taste by choosing Cebu Pathetic and will sit through delay and delay, lost bags, incompetent staff and dirty airplanes.  I have given Cebu Pacific chance after chance and ironically they always state after a delay ""We hope we can make it up to you on your next flight"".  Last time flying with Cebu Pacific and will rather pay higher prices.",1
2015,"Cebu Pacific is a low-cost carrier, and their flights are usually quite cold. The food you can book in advance or purchase onboard is not great, but will do considering the low price. Their ground service announcements should improve. They beat their competitors when it comes to price, if you are only on a short flight. On the aircraft, staff is usually friendly, but no entertainment system whatsoever.",0
2015,"Cebu Pacific and their staff couldn't sink much lower. Arrived at MNL terminal 3 at 9 am for 10.55hrs flight, check in smooth, at around 09.40hrs announcement made that both the 1000hrs and 10.55hrs flights to Davao were delayed due to late arrival of turnaround aircraft! Stock announcement made for virtually every departure this day! I approached customer services who were not interested in providing any information, or assistance and it would appear to offer standard advise of just sit and wait. Was however advised by a manager that the flight would depart at 1200hrs. At 1200hrs no announcements made and staff were now advising that the flight would now depart at 1300hrs. At 1300hrs told 1400hrs, then 1435hrs. Finally boarded at 1500hrs but then sat aboard for another 30 minutes waiting for pushback. Finally arriving in DVO at 1755Hrs. Overall it would appear that customer Service staff are not interested in giving any constructive or accurate advise to passengers and will happily just say anything no matter how ludicrous, just to keep customers placated. At 1245hrs was told the flight had landed and was being serviced for departure. At 1300 this had changed to waiting for aircraft to land. Then at 1400hrs they blamed ATC saying no idea when it will land. Was even told the flight had been waiting to land for over 2 hours. Most airlines around the world are proud of their punctuality and strive to achieve the goal of customer satisfaction. Sadly Cebu Pacific don't know the meaning of this industry standard ethos and achieving an acceptable level of punctuality or customer satisfaction is completely unknown to them. Often proudly announcing on-time punctuality as low as 50-60% for the month. In a country which heavily relies on an airline network to service outlying islands, both the country and people of the Philippines deserve better than this debacle of an airline. Cannot score it 0/10 for that is the true score it deserves.",1
2015,"Cebu Pacific is no frills and no favours with leg room, but in my experience the aircraft are clean and they run a pretty professional show. Flights were pretty much on time, save for ATC delays on the return flight to ManilaOne bone to pick - I chose not to purchase checked baggage, relying on the 7kg cabin allowance. At the end of the online checkin for the ATR flight, I was ""reminded"" (for the first time) that the carry-on allowance was only 5kg on ATR aircraft! And then having checked in, it was too late to purchase checked baggage! I was ready to point out to check-in staff that the 5kg limit wasn't mentioned on the website, but they seemed to be still operating on the 7kg limit.",0
2015,"Cebu Pacific, Economy, MNL-SYD. On time takeoff. Very expensive food if not pre-booked. Seats are narrow with poor recline. Budget airline so price was ok, but not as cheap as they used to be. Not sure if I would use them again.",0
2015,"I wasn't really surprised at the 1-hour delay of my Manila to Cebu flight with Cebu Pacific, since it was out of Manila, but I was a bit disappointed at the lack of clear information provided. I booked the best seat in the plane and paid extra for it as there was no business class available. I'd say the extra 200 Php was worth it given that the plane was packed and the extra leg room was well-appreciated. The flight was alright and since they turned the airline into a ""budget"" airline there really wasn't much to it. It was a short flight so I didn't mind too much.  Don't bother looking for more though as all domestic airlines and flights are ""budget"" versions now. I would choose this airline over the others again though.",0
2015,"Flight 5J-962 on Aug 4. Nothing much to say, the flight was on time, the price was cheap, the staff were nice. No food or drinks unless you are willing to pay for it. Good experience flying from point A to point B.",0
2015,"This is a no frills airline as you know. But you get what you paid for. The seats were not comfortable, during the 3 hours that we were in the air that's the time I slept, Secondly the FA's were very chatty (they were chatting loudly) and the plane was not clean. However, I still recommend because it was very cheap.",0
2015,"I have used this airline numerous times over the past couple of years and there is one thing you can almost always be sure of, your flight will be late (and I'm not counting delays caused by Manila air traffic control). Be prepared for cancelled flights (often at the last minute). My last flight (Manila to Cebu) was 90 minutes late due to 'a problem with the aircraft'. Tardiness apart, everything else was pretty much as one would expect from a no-frills airline. The staff were okay, check-in passable, the cabin was a little dirty with breadcrumbs on my seat.",1
2015,SYD-MNL. Check in process looked like it was going to take a long time (huge line) but actually was very well run and took less than 20 minutes. Departed on time/arrived on time. I am 6ft3 and a very large build yet found the seat width and legroom (in the last 4 rows) very good and actually better than a lot of full service carriers. We did not pre-order any meals as they looked less than appealing but snacks were available and very reasonable prices. Great cabin crew always around if needed. Toilets kept clean and despite a full flight were never overcrowded. Very happy with this flight.,0
2015,Flew MLA-BKK return then domestic flight MLA-CYN return. No late running on these journeys though I know it can happen. The usual pleasant helpful staff except in Bangkok. They operate from Terminal 3 in Manila which is also decent.,0
2015,Our family of 18 adults and children were supposed to return to Manila on the last afternoon flight from Coron in early April. As expected the flight got delayed a few times until it was announced that it was cancelled. Someone told us that usually if late afternoon flights are delayed chances are they get cancelled as Coron's airport does not have runway lights at night. We got shuttled to a hotel in the town proper and we were given 4 rooms which we refused as there were at least 5 families. We negotiated to be transferred to another (better) hotel which fortunately had the required 5 rooms. While this was a harrowing experience for us we were fortunate that their staff listened and attended to our needs. Cancelled flights are a big inconvenience esp when you are travelling with small children. We probably will never fly Cebu Pacific anymore.,1
2015,5J404 Apr 2nd and 5J405 Apr 9th. CEB seems to attempt promoting people to spend more time at the airport. For our recent family trip MNL to LAO they first informed by email and even followed up by call that the flight departure time was 1.5hrs earlier than scheduled. Just to let us then wait for almost 2hrs at a very crowded gate for the departure with a short note that the airplane had not yet arrived. We certainly would have found a better use in MNL for those 2hrs instead of waiting at the airport. It seems CEB starts their implementation of new schedules with informing their customers but only some time later also telling to the pilots and airport about it - interesting approach. Funny enough once we arrived in LAO the crew even announced proudly we arrived as scheduled! On the return flight they seemed to attempt to make up for it by departing 10min ahead of schedule from LAO. Leaves me wondering why they have a schedule at all?,1
2015,Flew from Hong Kong to Cebu in March 2015. My wife did the booking so I was spared the aggravation of dealing with CP booking procedures and the constantly changing/escalating prices throughout the process. The usual complete chaos at Cebu Pacific check-in HK with insufficient check in staff and no organisation with a planeload of customers queuing for one Cebu flight desk up to the last minute whilst later CP flights were being also being checked-in. CP routinely boards from the satellite terminal which is a bus ride away from the main airport terminal. Stressful start to the journey. Once on the flight you realise why headline prices are so cheap with the bare minimum of legroom no food or even water unless you pay. Overall cheap but uncomfortable and stressful.,1
2015,Having recently travelled on uncaring Sri Lankan Airlines it was a pleasure to be back on Cebu Pacific (SIN-MNL.) While seat pitch is restricted somehow the A320 felt more roomy than on UL. The 5J flight crew (all female as is often the case) were very pleasant and had manners unlike some on UL. The annoying Cebu Pacific game is repetitive and the prize of a small pouch hardly anything to rave about. In contrast there is quite a good selection of reasonably priced snacks while the pre-ordering of hot meals has become quite popular. Cebu Pacific flights are popular and in my case ran almost on time which was a bonus.,0
2015,I undertook 6 flights on Cebu Pacific in February 2015. On 5 out of the 6 flights were delayed and the common excuse was traffic issues at Manila. This while other airlines plying the same route were leaving on time without any delays. Cebu Pacific announce proudly on their website when you book that they have a 69.1% punctuality rate for February! Onboard seating is comfortable and service is good though I do wish they would stop playing those silly games which can be annoying if trying to sleep on a night flight. There doesn't seem to be a consistent set of rules regarding use of ipads during flight. Some of the flights it was announced that it was ok to use ipads/ tablets if in flight mode throughout the flight from pushback to landing. On other flights they weren't allowed to be used till at cruising altitude. Since Cebu Pacific took over Tiger Air for domestic flights in the Philippines there now is really only Cebu Pacific of Philippine Airlines and as a result a number of routes have been cut completely and fares increased significantly. Cebu Pacific announced no more fuel surcharges however the price of flights increased so customers pay the same or more. When booking online beware of the add on's such as insurance / seat selection etc which are automatically added and must be removed by passenger if not wanted. Overall Cebu Pacific have good modern aircraft and provide a decent service just allow extra time (3 hours) for delays which almost always occur.,0
2015,Manila-Butuan/Manila-Cebu round trip: The price was really cheap but it fired me back with 3 hour delayed flight and overpriced meal (cup of water - 50 Pesos) seriously? From the airport the first checked in bag cost me 540Pesos (around $12) for only 15kilos which was really pricey for local travelers. The flight was not that smooth but the flight attendants were really polite. This flight is not recommended for travelers with international connecting flights on the same day. This is a really time consumable flight in exchange of lower price.,1
2015,I travelled with Cebu Pacific on 1 Feb 2015 from MNL-USU and on 3 Feb 2015 from USU-MNL in the afternoon and from MNL-SIN in the evening. I was worried after reading all the negative reviews about CP as it was my first time travelling with them and deliberately gave myself a long layover (about 5hrs) btw my return flight from USU and then to SIN on the same day. I pleasantly surprised when I travelled with them. I did a web check-in and got to the check-in counter 2hrs before flight time. Ground crew was friendly and polite. Flight left on time for MNL-USU and there was only a 15 min delay from MNL-SIN. Seats are typically what you find on a budget air. Didn't eat so can't comment on the food. Good thing CP is at Terminal 3 as I could eat do a massage and shop a bit during my layover. Would fly with them again.,0
2015,Dubai - Manila - CDO on 16 December. Flight was very basic food was poor minimal and overpriced. No inflight entertainment staff were correct but seemed more interested in chatting to each other. My seat was near the emergency exit so enough foot space but due the freezing air leaking through the door far from pleasant. Transit in Manila was ok although in Dubai we were advised by Cebu Pacific to collect and transport our luggage ourselves. Totally unnecessarily and did pressure our short transit time of 90 minutes. On departure at CDO a very friendly counter staff member gave us a some VIP treatment prepared all OWF papers of my wife managed to transit our luggage by Cebu Pacific itself because the very short transit time in Manila (from T3 TigerAir to T4 Cebu Pacific in 90minutes!) and gave us both seats in the front-row. The flight from Manila to Dubai was very bumpy and unpleasant so Cebu Pacific has it's pro's and cons.,0
2015,Our flight was scheduled to leave from Manila to Caticlan (Boracay) on January 8 2015 at 2.35pm. First no announcements were made until past departure time. Once the announcements finally came they merely mentioned as a side note that our flight was canceled and that we should proceed to the counter for rebooking. After waiting in line for another half hour they booked us on a 5:30 PM flight which however will only leave at 8pm because (as usual) other delays. This flight was now going to Kalibo which is another 2 hour bus travel away from Caticlan. That flight was delayed AGAIN and departed only at 9.30pm. We landed in Kalibo at 10.30pm and arrived at our hotel at around 1am. All other airlines left on time so it definitely wasn't an issue with the Airport.,1
2014,Return flights booked from Manila to Caticlan. The flight out was meant to be at midday but was delayed several times with no announcements before we eventually were taken out on the bus to the plane 3.5 hours late. We were taken back to the terminal again and told the flight was cancelled. We were then put on a later flight to Kalibo even though we had paid to fly to Caticlan - this was to leave at 5pm. This flight was then delayed 30 then 60 then 90 minutes finally leaving at 8.45pm. This got us to Kalibo at around 10pm and we then had to get a coach for 2 hours to get us to where we should have been at 1pm. We finally got to our destination at 1:30am - about 12 hours after we should have. The night before we flew back we got an email to say our flight was cancelled and we were to call them to rebook or get a refund. We rang and could not get through to anyone. As a result we had to book a Philippines airline flight at our expense to ensure we got back to Manila for our connecting flight home a total disaster. Trying to get a refund from them for the cancelled flight took over 30 minutes on the phone and it will then be 10 business days until the refund is even processed. Will never fly them again.,1
2014,MNL-TPE on Flight 5J312. Snagged a promotional fare which kept the cost of this flight very low even after adding extra for baggage etc. Polite cabin crew prompt and patient with passenger requests. Seat comfort was adequate for the short flight (2 hours) but probably not for a longer route. IFE nonexistent (unless you count the in-house magazine and the infamous onboard games). Food not bad but hideously overpriced better save your money for a meal at the airport. Arrived on time. Will fly with Cebu Pacific again on this route if I can get cheap seats during a sale.,0
2014,"I am not impressed by Cebu Pacific and doubt I will fly with them again. Was supposed to fly out from Caticlan (Boracay) to Manila but flight got cancelled and we were put on another flight out of Kalibo which is 2hrs away from Caticlan. I had to arrange for a transfer on my own terms. Then the flight out of Kalibo was over an hour late without notification. The boards did not show any flight status's. I had to ask to find out and I was told 30mins delay or more. I thought because Kalibo airport is small that's why it seemed so unorganized. I finally get to Manila where I have a connecting flight to Hanoi. And it happens again. Gate changes twice flight delayed without any notification. No one at the gate to assist. No communication whatsoever on why we aren't boarding at the time indicated on our boarding passes. My flight ended up being delayed by over an hour again. The staff are polite and helpful but they should be trained to be more proactive in updating passengers. The flight cabin is also tight not much leg room if you are 5'7"" or taller. Planes are also quite loud. All in all my experience has been disappointing.",1
2014,I flew Cebu last July from Manila - Cebu and back. I have nothing but praise for the airline. The return trip could have been a nightmare as I needed to get to Manila for connecting flight to Schiphol. My scheduled flight was delayed for some hours due to impending typhoon and I would have missed the connection. The wonderful staff at the desk pulled out all the stops and got me on the earlier flight with minutes to spare. I got on board just as doors were closing and made my connection in Manila. I cannot imagine this happening anywhere else.,0
2014,Posted fares are deceptive and your actual fare may double. We flew Clark to Singapore connecting to Jakarta. There is a fee to connect fuel surcharge security charge web admin fee luggage $50 aviation levy and seat selection fee for each leg. My original trip was 14000 peso but I ended up paying 30500. You can take PAL or Garuda for the same price. There needs to be transparency in pricing and their advertising is deceptive. Aircraft was half full but you are not allowed to move to a seat with more space. I had middle seal in the last row with passengers on both sides. In spite of empty seats forward I was not allowed to move. Hand carry baggage was on the floor blocking egress as the overheads were jammed full. I kept briefcase at my feet.,1
2014,"I recently flew Cebu Pacific BKK-MNL red-eye flight which was fine (I paid for an exit seat). A few days later I flew MNL-PPS - being the day after the Manila floods the terminal was in complete chaos and the flight was 2 hours late but not bad in the circumstances and again the flight itself was fine. Cebu Pacific fares can look like a good deal but beware of their change fees. Due to the floods I needed to rearrange my travels and change my return flight from PPS. It would have cost me 1977PHP to change my CEB ticket - I chose instead to pay 1837PHP to buy a whole new ticket on Philippine Airlines. With PAL I was able to pay with my Australian Mastercard and avoid CEB's ""web admin fee"".",1
2014,Flew on their new route MNL-SYD. As this is a low cost carrier you get what you pay for. There are no blankets pillows complimentary food and drinks or Inflight Entertainment. However the website was easy to navigate when making bookings the aircraft was clean cabin crew were friendly lavatories spotless throughout the flight and the flight was on time. Inflight entertainment consisted of complimentary wi-fi with movie and magazine choices for viewing. You need your own wi-fi enabled device to use the service. Internet access was also available for USD12.00 for the flight. The wi-fi service was stable and reliable. If all you are seeking is a cheap seat Cebu Pacific is the way to go. The fare cost AUD150.00. A competing carrier was offering a fare of AUD700.00. A nice touch was entering the aircraft into the cabin not via a galley which is standard of most aircraft designs. Entering directly into the cabin creates the impression of more space. The configuration of the Cebu Pacific A330-200 is tight with only 8 lavatories. However the cabin is all one class of service and there were no queuing issues with lavatories. Will fly them again for the cheap ticket cost and friendly service.,0
2014,Flew SYD-MNL return for $144 (AUD) return bargain of a deal. Having flown AirAsia many times I knew the standards of a low cost airline it was pretty much the same. The planes were very quiet (new Airbus A330-300) seats were a little bit smaller and not as comfortable (harder) than AirAsia seats also the recline angle was not as generous but for the price and short distance who cares? A little over cautious on the final security check at the gate on our return flight from MNL total unnecessary (probably not their fault though but rather a requirement set by the Australian Government same thing happens in KL for example). This meant a delayed departure of about 40min they should have allocated more time prior to boarding. Would I fly with them again yes if you love the Philippines and don't care about 'proper airline' service then why not I could even see myself pay $600 for a flight beats flying to KL and then onwards. There are a few other operational procedures they should iron out but fairly satisfied.,0
2014,"If you are looking for a cheap easy flight look elsewhere. Cebu lists low rates to get you started on purchasing a ticket by listing a super low price. By the time you're finished making the reservation it might be quite a bit more and by the time they finish ""nickle-and-diming"" you for all the ""extras"" you will have paid more for the flight. In my case I got a round trip ticket from Japan to Manila for what I thought would only be about $300 USD. By the time I finished checking in for my return flight I will have spent more than $700 USD in total. For an international flight that provided no food or water without extra payment. Everything about the flight is cheap. There are no movies no pillows no blankets if buy food on the flight they hand you a hot aluminium case of food (street vendor style) without a tray like other airlines do which makes it all to easy for things to drop away under other seats. In my case I only had so many Philippine Pesos left so I could only afford a dish to eat but couldn't get any water or anything at all to drink. Take my advice if you want a well priced flight that has transparent policies provides food and water during long international flights has movies to watch provides comfort in the cabin (with bedding and providing liquids to drink) choose another airline: for example ANA Singapore Air JAL United. I've travelled to over 30 countries. Cebu was one of the more expensive flights I've taken (final price) and the value for money was the absolute worst.",1
2014,"DXB-MNL MNL-DXB - as what the brand suggests ""Budget Airline"" so don't expect a five star service. Nevertheless the cabin is clean staff are friendly food are good (Chicken Adobo and Beef Caldereta).",0
2014,Flew Bangkok-Manila and return. This was my first flight with this airline and I was very impressed. Flight attendants were efficient and pleasant. I would most definitely use them again.,0
2014,Flight from DUM-MNL on a A320. Nice flight without problems. The crew were really nice and polite.,0
2014,"My family and I had a Manila - Caticlan flight and it couldn't have gone any smoother. We were running late for our check in as there was a car accident on the way and we thought that we would miss our flight. Luckily as we arrived at the counter they were just putting the ""closed"" sign up and they put us through. One of our group member hadn't pre-purchased the baggage allowance so that took a few more minutes to put through. As we were on our way to the gate we heard our names being called and made a quick dash to the gate and again as we arrived the were just closing the gate and they quickly called the bus over to take us to the tarmac! We found them to be very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely travel with them again.",0
2014,"5J142 MNL-HKG. Often take Cebu pacific for this route and usually on time give or take 10-15 mins. The only complaint is that the departure gates are a mess. We checked in and were told it is gate 109. When we passed immigration noticed an electronic board saying gate 114. I went to 109 which was packed and asked a CP representative who said yes the flight has been changed to gate 114. Went back to 114 where just a handful of people were waiting and indeed we did embark from gate 114 (to a bus which drove us close to gate 110) and then I could see lots of people scurrying from 109 to 114 so they clearly hadn't told all the waiting passengers at 109! There as mass confusion as it seemed almost every flight had its gate changed. Apart from that it is what you expect no food or drink (and no veggie dishes to buy) silly games which pass as ""entertainment"" to make my flight ""more memorable"" but it got back on time and that's what matters!",0
2014,DGT-MNL Seat 1A on 5J626. Flight cost 21 including seat reservation and 20Kg hold luggage. No meal service as it is a low cost airline. On time departure and early arrival for this 1h10 min domestic flight. Cabin crew friendly and full of smiles. A320 new and felt safe onboard.,0
2014,As has been mentioned by others have flown Cebu Pacific for years. I have an account that pulls up 7 pages of flights that I've recently booked for family and friends and myself. But no more. Flights get changed too often and there is absolutely nil for error on the customer's part. This is part of the low cost ethos. I get it. However having not taken our flights last night owing to their computer not working we are out over 43000pesos. Forfeit is the term they throw around. When I booked all was fine when I flew each flight time was changed at least once. The last flight was 30 min. earlier which meant we missed our international flight. The girl at the counter tried to scurry but she knew it was for not. It is the customer's loss. As it stands they have flown a total of 10 empty seats that I have paid for. Some were my fault but some were due to scheduling conflict created by adjusting flight timetables. There is zero allowance for this. Low cost carriers yes! When they change a flight they still maintain forfeit forfeit forfeit.,1
2014,"I booked a flight from CRK to HKG with Tiger air on 1 March and from then on things rapidly went downhill. On 11 March I received an e-mail from Tiger air telling me that my early morning flight was now an evening departure. On 20 March a further e-mail arrived telling me my booking reference was now a new Cebu Pacific one and any inquiries were to be directed to them. I found that I was now unable to check-in online and had to do this at the airport. Come departure time there is no sign of the flight. No announcements had been made so I went to the inquiry desk to see four members of staff staring intently at their I-phones. I was informed that the aircraft was on its way and would be here in 30 minutes. One and a half hours late we finally departed. No announcements from the flight deck for the duration of the journey and no apologies received from the cabin staff. On the return flight I went to Terminal 1 as per my flight itinerary only to be told ""no it's terminal 2"".",1
2014,Mar 6 2014 DXB-MNL New A330-200 aircraft was used and its so refreshing once u enter on the plane seat is narrow for economy flight crew were polite and always smiling. Very cheap fare compared to others on time departure from DXB and arrival in MNL. Will definitely fly this airline again.,0
2014,I have flown Cebu Pacific every 3 months for more than 10 years booking both international and domestic routes through them. Yes there had been occasional issues but nothing like what is happening currently. I had booked a direct Bangkok to Cebu route several months ago for a flight for the end of this month March. On Feb 18th Cebu notified me that this route had been cancelled but they would offer me a BKK-MNL-CEBU route and return at no extra charge. I told them that the BKK-Manila they were offering me departing Bangkok at 12.30 in the morning arriving in MNL at 4.50am and then a multi-hour layover in MNL before the late morning flight to Cebu (total flying and ground time of around 9 hours) was not convenient to me and could I take the mid-morning departure from BKK and connection from there. Answer no. I asked if I could take the early morning routing they were suggesting but take a two day layover in MNL (at my own expense) so I could rest and then continue on the late night flight to Cebu. Answer no. They insist I must take the inconvenient departure time and complete my travel in one day. I have booked Philippine Air for my return because they are virtually the same fare price no add-ons and have a much more convenient schedule for this route. Where Cebu Pacific had been my first airline of choice now they will be my last.,1
2014,MNL-HK on a 5.30 am flight. Check-in is a breeze since we opt for web-check-in (10 min for baggage drop and immigration) Cebu Pacific uses NAIA Terminal 3 so no complains there. Immigration personnel are all young (no more grumpy old immigration staff). Boarding is on time flight crew are very warm and friendly. Landed 10 min ahead of schedule. Will fly them again for International trips especially in the morning schedule but totally opposite with domestic flights. Seats are comfortable if you're lucky enough to ride their new A320.,0
2014,MNL-BKK. Last minute change of plans so only booked a few days ahead. Price pretty much the same price as Philippine Airlines. This has been a steady trend with Cebu Pacific - they're not as cheap as they used to be. On the plus side the flight was bang on time not too crowded with efficient cabin crew. Drinks and snacks were available at reasonable prices. But the best part of using Cebu Pacific is operating out of Terminal 3 zero wait to check-in early morning and 10 minutes later I'm relaxing in Departures.,0
2014,We had two flights: Flight 5J384 Cagayan De Oro City to Manila then 5J499 Manila to Kuala Lumpur. We taxied out onto the runway we sat there for 15 minutes as we didn't have clearance to take off. Check in was quite clean I was happy to have my bags checked in all the way to Kuala Lumpur. Flight staff were friendly and food wasn't too bad. Arrived in Manila on time. Departing for Kuala Lumpur proceeded straight through to immigration and then to the gate. I love the convenience of international and domestic being at the same terminal that was the main reason I choose Cebu Pacific for my flight to KL. Food selection was quite bland onboard. Arrival into KL was on time a little early. It is a shame they land at LCCC but you get what you pay for. Overall Cebu Pacific for the price stood outt. I would recommend them based on what I paid.,0
2014,Recently flew SIN-MNL and just pleased with the overall experience on flying with 5J. Check-in at SIN was easy with the web-check-in desk the plane was spotless crew was very pleasant and best of all getting to land in NAIA Terminal 3. I have flown with 5J since the late 90's with their DC9's and have been lucky to have never experienced the problems many have listed here.,0
2014,DXB-MNL-LGP-MNL-DXB flew outbound leg on 25-DEC-2013. My review would focus more on reliability of this airline. In MNL I had immediate connection to LGP with only about 1.15 hrs to catch the flight including immigration formalities. A slight delay in DXB would mean missing my flight. However thanks to Cebu Pacific for their timely departure from DXB and arriving 15 mins. early in MNL - could have been earlier without the usual traffic congestion in MNL. I was able to catch my flight to LGP with one day to prepare for my sister's wedding. Return flight was the same - on time.,0
2014,December 2013 I flew 5 CPA flights Bangkok - Manila return and 3 internal flights. All were on time leaving FA were polite and attentive so for a budget airline my experience was excellent. I really do not understand why people complain about this airline so much as I have used them in the past and will continue to use them in the future if they keep providing such good value for money.,0
2013,Hong Kong to Bacolod via Cebu and Bacolod to Manila. Very poor airline. Each flight was unadulterated. Seat pitch is miserable. Check in at Bacolod was a terrible mess and so many extra taxes to pay at the airport. Fares are not budget when all the hidden add ons are included. Will not fly Cebu Pacific again.,1
2013,They cancelled our flight to Caticlan. Asked us to take another flight to Kalibo 3 hours later. When we demanded a refund they said they would only refund one way and that we had to forfeit our return ticket. After hours of waiting we found out that they had other flights to Caticlan which they told us was cancelled but actually continued. After arguing with the counter staff and managers only were we allowed to take another flight to Caticlan. Same issue from Caticlan to Manila. Flight was cancelled. After continuously complaining at the counter they allowed us to take the earlier 5J Cebu Pacific flight back from Caticlan to Manila. Horrible Service.,1
2013,9th Nov Hong Kong- Manila and Manila- Busuanga (cancelled). 15th Nov - Tagbilaran - Manila and Manila - Caticlan (diverted to Kalibo). During the last few weeks we have made 4 trips on Cebu Pacific and each one has been a challenge. 3 flights were delayed and 1 cancelled completely. Of the 3 which were delayed one to Caticlan was so late they ended up diverting to Kalibo as the airport was closed. As soon as anything goes wrong they are useless. I made 2 calls to them and spent over 2.5 hours trying to resolve problems and all you do is go round in circles. When you ask to speak to a manager they tell you there isn't one. If you insist eventually one appears. Their managers aren't any better though so there really is very little point. If they promise to email you don't believe them. They're unlikely to bother. Don't expect to be informed if you're flight is cancelled if you haven't got a local number. All in all if things go smoothly you may be ok. Once they start to go wrong you're in trouble. If you want some degree of certainty you may be better sticking with PAL!,1
2013,Singapore-Manila (return). Flight to Manila on an A320. Delayed with no notice or apology in Singapore. It's as if nothing happened. Very tight leg room and no magazines on seat pocket which made the no IFE flight seem longer. Also cabin was not clean with pen marks on seat tray table and bits of chips fell while taking bag from overhead compartment. Return flight was on a new A330. Seats were fairly comfortable and clean cabin. Overall uneventful flights and very cheap fares. I don't mind flying with them again for short haul flights (if given a choice between Cebu Pacific and another airline I will choose the latter) but it's a big no for long haul flights.,0
2013,Definitely by far the worst airlines I have encountered. Boarded the plane at Manila to go to Caticlan which is supposed to be a 45 min flight. The plane did not leave Manila until 5.5 hours later and still with all passengers on board the plane. Unacceptable excuses provided by the captain and also we were diverted to Kalibo Airport instead. Due to this incident we lost one nights accommodation in Boracay. Pay the extra fees for an airline that you know is reliable.,1
2013,TAC-MNL (5J-654). Delayed almost 20 minutes due to bad weather cond. Good seats friendly flight attendants food and drinks served for a fee.,0
2013,MNL-TAG short hall domestic flight with 8 people including infants. Flight was a bit late but was a nice Airbus jet and was OK. Very good fare except they nickel and dime you for everything and they have no advanced boarding for families with infants.,0
2013,5J 805 MNL-SIN. First time to taking Cebu Pacific internationally and I was honestly a little apprehensive. PROS: Cheaper fare than PR or SQ. Online check in (not available in PR) allows me more time to do more things before heading to the airport. Use of T3 instead of surly T1 or stuffy T2. CONS: Tight seats and poor pitch (you get what you pay for). Poor selection of in flight meals for purchase. This is most pronounced in flights scheduled during the lunch or dinner hours. Will consider flying with them but will always give it second and third thoughts.,1
2013,Every time I travel with Cebu the plane is either late or cancelled. If they weren't so cheap I would never use them. Customer service is appalling regard for international flight safety rules is scant (I have seen children allowed to sit in exit rows people standing up during taxi phones used prior to landing. My last trip has prompted me to write as my flight was cancelled (again) we were bussed 1.5 hours to another airport to find that the flight there was delayed too (no announcement only found out when we asked). We were given no water for the bus journey the bus driver was constantly on the phone and driving with one hand even when changing gear and the food offered (or 150 pesos instead - $3) was pathetic. I feel sorry for their staff who constantly have to deal with upset passengers like me because their employer is so hopeless. I worry that this airline is starting flights to Dubai in the Autumn - rather you than me!,1
2013,Flew Cebu - Clark return flight check in was proficient and flight left on time. In flight service was good with provision of snacks and drinks for sale at reasonable prices. Staff were friendly and made flight enjoyable.,0
2013,April 5 2013 we were scheduled to fly to Manila from Naga for our connecting flight to Bangkok. One hour before boarding we received an announcement that there was a delay of 3 hours. We didn't leave until after 5pm our flight on Philippine Airlines was scheduled to depart at 7.20 pm. Ended up arriving in Manila 6.50 pm. Prior to departing Naga we had told the crew of our situation and they promised us that they will talk to the captain and other crew and that they will assist us with getting our check-in bag immediately instead of getting it from the carousel. However we discovered was that no one had communicated with any other crew members about us. They did not allow us to take our baggage right after stepping out of the plane; we had to wait for our baggage like everyone else. When we finally gathered our belongings we needed to run to catch a taxi to Terminal 1. Ended up missing our flight to Bangkok. Ended up paying $630 + to book a Kuwait bound to Bangkok.,1
2013,MNL-TPE v.v. Check-in was fast at NAIA however small confusion that the monitor is showing a wrong counter for the flight and were directed by the ground staff to the other side. Flight left on time on both sectors clean cabin but with a broken tray table legroom is restricted and uncomfortable for a red-eye flight since most PAX reclining their seatbacks so it was hard to move. FAs were mixture of smiling and cheerful ladies down to bored but still polite crew and I like that they were proactive in turning on/off the reading lights for the PAX. Buy-on-board choices are good and I think were in the right price too. Overall it was a good value for the money especially for short flights and I would recommend it to those travellers who are on a budget.,0
2013,BKK-MNL. Flight left 1 hour late though that was beneficial to me. Staff really pleasant and helpful. Plane was clean and cabin announcements clear in both English and Filipino (sometimes I can never hear what's being said). Legroom bad but not unexpected for an economy airline. Food prices very reasonable at about 80p - 1.20 for soft drinks and the same again for snacks. 5 for a meal but didn't try. Only grumble is the shocking seat reclining pitch. If the passenger in front reclines then you can't even bring your tray down. It was a nightmare. Had to hold drinks in my hands in 20 years of flying never known anything like it!,0
2013,Flew Cebu Pacific 5 times last month mostly on short-haul international flights (CEB-HKG MNL-HAN REP- MNL). All flights on time aircraft clean new aircraft lovely crews with even warm automated announcements.,0
2013,MNL-CEB / CEB-MNL - Flight was on time it was pleasant nothing really special but generally OK. However we experienced a bit of inconvenience as the line for the check in counter at the terminal 3 in Manila was strangely slow. It might be due to the passenger volume but they could have done better service.,0
2013,Very efficient and professional. All flights on time plenty of leg space for decent additional fee friendly staff.,0
2013,HKG-MNL-HKG - first leg was during the busy Christmas period (flight was Dec 24). Excellent check-in experience in HKG. HKG has a well earned reputation as one of the best airports in the world. I love the fact that you can do web check-in with Cebu. It helps when you get to the airport and puts them above some other low cost airlines. Busy flight to MNL but flight on time and in-flight staff are excellent as I've experienced in the past with Cebu. Quick baggage delivery in MNL and terminal 3 is by far the best in MNL. Love the all over free wifi as in HKG. However the experience there during the return to HKG was not quite the same. Cebu staff managed to give us the wrong boarding card which we discovered after going through security (and the associated payment of airport fees). It got fixed but it was the first time I've ever experienced this sort of thing. Made for a stressful departure out of MNL. Better look closely at your boarding pass when flying Cebu. Inflight to HKG was exactly the same as before. Again a very busy flight but friendly in-flight staff and plenty of smiles. While you definitely get what you pay for and Cebu is a low cost option I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.,0
2013,Flight from MNL-HKG then HKG-MNL. Check in was fast. The plane was clean but the other equipment was broken. Flight attendants were very friendly. They have in-flight games for entertainment that made passengers happy. A great budget airline all in all a good flight.,0
2013,My wife and I have just completed 6 flights with Cebu Pacific around the Philippines over the past month. Our plane was never delayed (more often leaving and arriving early) for shortish flights seats are comfortable enough. I would fly with them again.,0
2012,Flew first time with them from Manila to Hong Kong. Price was cheaper than competitor. Fight was 4.40 pm and it left 5 minutes early however due to heavy traffic flight didn't take off until 30 mins late. Bought food at time of booking. Hot food not so good but it was cheap. Lots of leg room since I got emergency exit seat. Seat cannot be adjusted backwards. Staff seemed to be efficient. No problems with this airline and will use them again.,0
2012,Flown Manila-Naga route several times in the last month. All in all we found it to be barely average. The focus is not on customer satisfaction and I would only fly with them again if I had no other choice.,1
2012,Flight from SIN-Manila. Very bad experience my wife had to suffer a 17 hour delay before the plane left Singapore and no proper explanations given. She had to board and disembark from the plane twice due to 'technical problems' and when a replacement plane finally flew in it was delayed again due to staff 'forgetting' to get landing clearance from Manila Airport. All in all a very bad experience and we won't be flying with Cebu Pacific again.,1
2012,BKK-MNL-BKK. Check-in in both BKK and MNL was efficient. NAIA-3 very quick. I usually buy the 20kg Baggage Allowance just to avoid the hassle. Both flights were on time even late in the day but arrival into BKK was delayed because the pilot parked incorrectly and had to be pushed back to the correct position... Cabin Service was fine but the flights were quieter than usual I think because many passengers (me included) are flying Tiger from Clark to BKK because in some cases it's half the price of Cebu Pacific who are not significantly cheaper than Philippine Airlines on some routes. I've been looking at prices over the next few months and Cebu Pacific need to be more competitive if they want to fill their planes like they did a few years back.,0
2012,Cebu and Singapore last month September to watch the F1 Night Race. Both flights heading towards and returning from Singapore were on time. Both also arrived at least 25 minutes ahead of schedule. Sat in premium seats up front (row 1) so leg room was definitely not a problem. Arrived in the Budget Terminal but one of the first to leave through Terminal 2 after the Budget Terminal's closure. I just wish they use the tube in Cebu when boarding. Some people tend to forget that 5J is a budget carrier hence buying everything on board the new Hot Meals being offered actually was pretty good a bit expensive but pretty tasty. Really made the cabin smell good. Only suggestion is that they could provide passengers with food trays so things don't get messy or the mess could be kept in the tray since 5J tables are pretty flimsy. Just remember to Bring a good inflight kit (Bedroom/Hotel Slippers Blanket Neck Pillow Eye shades ear plugs headset fully charged iPad and MP3 Player thick socks lip balm and probably something good to eat). All in all a pretty great experience. Cebu - Singapore flights with 5J have always been traditionally on-time.,0
2012,MNL-USU-MNL. Our flight to USU was an hour late. Boarding was unbelievably disorganized. At one point staff just left and let everybody sort of do their own thing. On our way back to Manila our flight was 3 hrs delayed with no particular reason. Id rather pay extra in exchange for better service.,1
2012,MNL-PEK-MNL flights were both on time. Staff friendly and attentive to every need. As it is a budget airline food is available for a cost but not really a problem. Very good value for money and would continue using them.,0
2012,Dumaguete-Manila return. No problem flying from Dumaguete but the flight back from Manila to Dumaguete on the same day diverted due to low visibility. Flight diverted to Cebu for onward flight to Manila. We were told we could fly back the next morning from Manila and they were not responsible for our accommodation. If we did not want to go back to Manila we could get off at Mactan airport and we would have to make our way to Dumaguete at our expense. We ended up hiring a taxi to Bato that evening so we did not have to stay overnight in Cebu.,1
2012,Now sat in Manila awaiting a flight to Singapore. Of course it has just been announced that it will be delayed plus the previous flight and just about every outbound flight tonight. Weather is fine and skies clear? My connecting flight from Dumagute was also delayed tonight and a flight home from Bangkok last Tuesday delayed. No way to complain to Cebu Pacific or would they care less.,1
2012,We booked 6 months ago Manila-Caticlan flights were not cheap. It took us 1 hour at check-in because ground staff were busy explaining to other passengers why they had to pay extra for luggage. Our first experience of an airline doing body weight check. On our return we got an SMS the night before that our flight was cancelled. Explanation was vague. Rebooked on their Kalibo flight at 7.40pm had to travel by van for another 1.5 hrs to Kalibo upon check-in told our flight was delayed to 10.45pm! It seems flight cancellations are a regular occurrence.,1
2012,Have made numerous Cebu Pacific flights throughout Asia within the Philippines flights are generally good value for money but strict on baggage allowance. Found at BKK staff standing on edges of baggage scales adding between 2-5kg to actual weight of baggage so allowing them to claim excess baggage fees. My last flight from UK was weighed for internal UK flight at 23kg this was the same for my international flight from UK to Manila but for my internal flight from Manila to Cebu my baggage had suddenly gained 5.5kg in weight to 28.5kg - so excess baggage fees charged!,0
2012,BKK-MNL. I was satisfied with the level of service provided given that the price was considerably cheaper than other operators on the route. The flight time may be off putting for some departing BKK at 00.40 and arriving at 04.30. The flight was late on the date I travelled. I also used Cebu Pacific on a number of internal flights in the Philippines. I was impressed with all of them. Most were on time the staff pleasant and legroom adequate.,0
2012,A regular flyer between MNL and PVG-KIK. Check-in can be a little chaotic at NIAA. Aircraft fleet is very new mixture of A319/320. Flights often leave late from MNL but arrive early at their destination. I take an average of 10 flights a year and find them value for money compared to the national carriers.,0
2012,Manila to Cagayan de Oro City. Bought 2 round trip tickets with prepaid baggage allowance. Lines to check-in disorganized check-in counter employees unfamiliar with luggage rules Ended up paying for 2 one way ticket bound for Cagayn de Oro due to one luggage that we were going to pay for in the first place but was told that we didn't have to so we missed the plane. Took almost an hour to fall in line to pay for the luggage fee no one to help expedite in order to be on time to board. As often as we go back to the Philippines for a visit we will avoid taking Cebu Pacific.,1
2011,SIN-MNL-SIN SIN-CEB-SIN MNL-DVO-MNL. Flew with them a lot of times no real complaints and since I always take the midnight flights everyone is asleep so it is not really a problem. Check-in staff at Cebu did not seem to know what they were doing and held us for 20 mins while other passengers took less than 10 mins. Early flight departure from Davao to Manila found the airport chaotic (they just opened) but it is not really the airline's fault. Flights were smooth except for short turbulence. Check-in at Manila was quick.,0
2011,MNL-DVO-MNL. Good experience and have no complaints. Paid extra for emergency row seats (about $2) and found the seating to be more than adequate. On the return they substituted an A319 for A320 and re-seated me in the proper row. Good basic transportation with a bit of a flair. Good value for money and a pleasant experience.,0
2011,Prices are going up and reliability is going down. All International flights departing MNL last Saturday evening were late. No weather problems just late arrivals of aircraft. BKK was nearly 2.5 hrs late no flight information screens working in T3 and passengers were shuttled around like cattle between gates. I'd really like to know who gets these so called cheap GO Fares because it doesn't matter how far ahead you book nothing is available on the routes I fly. I'll continue to use Cebu because they offer good value for money no frills service but they need to work on reliability which has up to now been very good. If they went head-to- head with Air Asia they'd lose.,0
2011,Have flown Cebu Pacific many times now. They are cheap unless you have extra bags or extra weight or make last minute changes or miss a plane out of Manila. (get to MNL airport early!). Sometimes the flight leaves before the posted time. Their website is frequently not working correctly. Tried to pay for extra bags and kept getting an error message until after it was past the deadline for adding bags. Then had to pay at the airport extra. You can expect a last minute gate change frequently and you can expect to walk or bus to Term 2 in Manila from the plane even though the plane is sitting right at the enclosed walkway. Carry-on policy is sporadic so going from an International flight to a domestic flight on Cebu Pacific can be tricky and costly. With Cebu Pacific you get what you pay for - cheap flights and not always the greatest in customer service. Most Cebu employees really try hard though.,0
2011,HKG-MNL-HKG. Basic airline small snack selection but reasonably priced. Short turnaround times mean the plane isn't cleaned between flight - there were remains of the previous person's food in the seat pocket. Not a lot of legroom but okay. Note that if you print own boarding pass at HKG you still have to check-in as HKG don't accept home printed tickets just official ones. Ninoy Acquino Terminal 3 is the new international terminal - clean enough choices for food and drink etc.,0
2011,PUS-MNL-HKG. Was given the emergency exit row at no extra charge at check-in which was a pleasant surprise. All of the announcements onboard were automated which increased the sense that the air crew were doing their job in a mechanical way. Seats extremely thin but I wasn't going far on either leg. Terminal 3 in Manila quite easy to negotiate. Overall surprisingly good value for money.,0
2011,MNL-HKG-MNL. Everything is simple but efficient. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Cheap and affordable flights - worth the money. I would have loved to see a movie on board though. Something that they can probably venture into in the future. I recommend for short haul flights and if you are on a budget.,0
2011,Flights were cheap planes were clean staff helpful. Booked all flights online. There were never any problems with cancellations or baggage. This is definitely a no frills airline but still one of my favorite airlines world wide.,0
2011,CEB-DPL return. Very strict on baggage your flight will come out more expensive even if you pre-pay for your baggage. No more free baggage allowance on their flights. Ground staff at DPL are unprofessional and chaotic at the counters. Inflight crew carry out their job in a robotic manner.,1
2011,SIN-MLA-SIN. Check-in at SG budget terminal chaotic ground staff kept moving us between counters. Flight was delayed and it took 2 hrs to clear immigration in Manila. Return to SG was delayed 1 hr boarding gate kept changing. This airline has a habit of cancelling and delaying flights. Internet rates are sometimes more expensive than full-service airlines.,1
2011,MNL-TPE return and MNL-BKK return on A319/320. The tickets were cheap and paid extra for the exit row with no recline. All flights departed and arrived on time. Nothing noteworthy just standard low cost flights. The only downside was the 'currency game' played by the crew with passengers. On a daytime flight its fine but at 2am it can be irritating. Also flew MNL-MPH return. The flight there cancelled we notified a supervisor about transfer worries and she was excellent and put us on an earlier MPH flight than we had originally booked. Unfortunately our flight home was cancelled this time due to the weather. Like all low cost carriers you get what you pay for.,1
2011,MNL-BKK-MNL 7 times in the past year. No problems at all with online ticketing using a foreign Debit Card. Prices can vary quite a lot from day to day and I've never managed to get one of their so-called very cheap GO Fares. Changes can be expensive and I usually do those at their ticket office in NAIA-3. This terminal is by far the best in MNL. Check-in is efficient in MNL (though less so in BKK) and pre-paying for excess baggage (over 15kg) is now available when you book. Excellent on-time reliability on all flights. For some reason they do run the cabin temperature very cold on the A320 and this can be uncomfortable on a 3 hr+ flight. I've no problem paying for a snack and a drink if the ticket price is significantly cheaper than the competition which it is. No in-flight movies so bring a book. Good value for money on a safe and reliable airline and I'll continue to use Cebu Pacific.,0
2011,My experience flying with Cebu Pacific is fine. I had no problem booking online my 2 flights (Kinabalu-Manila & Clark-HK) from Jakarta they offer great prices for such short booking. The aircraft considered new clean cabin with leather seat (just like Airasia) the cabin crew were friendly enough they have interesting merchandise to sell onboard. ...only flight from Kinabalu was getting delayed (about 1hr). but overall were OK so I won't mind flying with Cebu for my next trip.,0
2011,"Flew the MNL-MPH route. Flight to Caticlan delayed finally got on. Flight back to Manila cancelled. All other airlines for the day were fully operational but Cebu Pacific insisted our one flight was cancelled because of weather meaning ""force majeur"" which leads to the next part. The solution was 2 hrs on a public bus at our cost to go to Kalibo then fly to Manila when we could get a flight out with any of the other airlines operating out of Caticlan as they could handle the ""weather"". No refund for the flight cancellation because of ""weather was outside their control""!",1
2011,Seoul-Manila-Seoul satisfactory for a low cost airline. Check-in smooth. I didn't buy any food because it seemed mostly unappealing. The return flight was extremely turbulent and although the turbulence was obviously not the fault of the airline it would have been good to hear some kind of announcements of reassurance from the captain as the atmosphere in the cabin was very tense for most of the flight.,0
2011,Our flight was delayed over an hour going to Kuala Lumpur and over 40 hours going back to Manila! Cebu Pacific didn't even bother to book us for an overnight stay at a hotel. We also had to demand for every meal voucher that we were provided. In the plane they ran out of hot meals (instant cup noodles) and chips. Prior seat selections we had paid for were not honoured either. To top it all when we got back to Manila our luggage was missing!,1
2011,Flights were in and out of Manila to Kalibo and also to Legazpi. While the prices are cheap and staff friendly the whole experience was a pain. Firstly the check-in at Manila is terrible. The queue seems to take forever as the staff are very slow which is not surprising as the admin and ticketing process they have is ridiculous. Multiple pieces of paper stapled together when just a boarding pass would suffice. At Manila expect to wait in line for at least an hour for check-in even if you are early. Every flight we took was at least an hour delayed this caused issues with our connections at the other end. The delays just seem to be a natural occurrence to Cebu Pacific which is probably why they offer no apology when they finally get round to notifying you of the delay. Once on board you can expect to wait quite a long time for the plane to actually leave as the runway traffic is very heavy at Manila.,1
2011,BKK-MNL was very good value for money. Paid for the extra legroom in Row 1 and also the extra 5kg. Very smooth check in and boarding and flight was on time. Crew friendly and there was food and drink available for purchase.,0
2011,MNL-KULh. Booked online from Australia with no problems. Seating somewhat cramped but OK for 3.5hr flight. Service onboard OK but not as friendly or /professional as Air Asia. Only paid A$90 so good value. Only problem was arriving at KUL LCC at 1am so stayed at Tune Hotel at LCC - very handy and cheap.,0
2011,Flew with them on PPS ILO and CEB routes on A320 and A319 and they were okay. You may encounter some delays but most of the time I was with them flights were just few minutes behind the scheduled departure. Seats are a little bit cramped up but it's okay for short domestic flights. Was able to fly with them for as cheap as 1 USD and these great deals make Cebu Pacific emerge as one of the best low-cost airlines.,0
2011,MNL-Cebu-Caticlan. Second flight was delayed for 9 hours. The ATR had technical problems and apparently Cebu Pacific did not have engineers to solve the problem. Staff were friendly and felt sorry for the delay: They even gave a voucher for a free flight to be used within 6 months. As I paid not even 3000 Php for both flights I can t complain.,0
2011,I've flown a few times - mainly between MNL DVO and CEB. Most times I've booked the flights from Australia and had no issues with the website or pricing. Airport experience does tend to be somewhat chaotic but onboard experience is fine. Comfortable and clean aircraft with cheerful crews. Since they're basically all short haul flights I don't mind about food or amenities.,0
2011,"There should be a body to review how Cebu Pacific do business online it's not much short of fraud. Almost every time I book on line the ultimate response is ""cannot process your card"" and every time you try again the price increases. In November I was booked on a Tiger flight from Clark Philippines to Singapore take off at 12.20. Tiger cancelled at 11.00am and accepted no responsibility for this. The Cebu Pacific flight taking off at 12.10 was only half full and put their price up immediately from 3950 pesos to 15000 pesos. Am I the only one who thinks this sort of practice is criminal?",1
2011,Cebu to Manila A319. Checkin very slow and seemed quite disorganised. Although aircraft was new seating very tight and uncomfortable. I was assigned a window seat on the last row which had no window and was so cramped that it proved to be one of the worst seats I have had to endure. It was impossible to sit in a normal fashion as my knees were pinned against the seat in front of me. I understand Cebu Pacific are a budget airline but I would eagerly pay more not to endure such seating again.,1
2011,Cebu Pacific has low published fares but by the time you pay for seating excess luggage any snacks including water and Anything else you are paying about the same as PAL. Couple this with the arrogant staff and it is not worth it. After my last trip I have decided that even if Cebu Pacific were free I would not use it. The last flight of my last trip was modified online and changed to a later time and I went through the payment process. When checking in I was told that no record existed and because I had missed my previous flight I would have to buy a new and much more expensive ticket. Having no choice I did so but will never fly them again. Their online booking system is so full of holes that you are taking a big risk with your credit card by using it.,1
2011,We had to cancel our flight with CEBU one week before we traveled due to a work emergency and they charged us approx 50% fee to do so then would only refund the remaining 50% in travel credit which must be used in 90 days. This company is predatory we were very disappointed in their policy.,1
2010,MNL-CGY-CEB-CGY. Wesbite was good though had some issues with it they accepted our Master Card. Check-In took forever because there were 11 of us; however; check-in agent was friendly and helpful. Terminal 3 is excellent leaps and bounds better than T1. Boarding was chaotic as ever on an A320. Seats comfy cabin was new and clean. Legroom was awful. FAs were unfriendly and robotic no smiles at all. Good BOB options good prices. Though a complimentary drink would be nice. CGY-CEB-CGY on a smaller ATR-72 both flights were uneventful. Both flights were departed and arrived nearly 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin were once again spotlessly clean FAs same we had the same FA on both legs sort of friendly. Had some games which was appreciated. Overall Cebu Pacific is a true lowcost carrier. I would use PR next time for more class and comfort.,0
2010,BKK-MNL-BKK twice in the past 4 months. On time departures and arrivals on all flights. No problems with ticketing and some very good prices to be had compared to PAL and Thai. Usual zoo of a check-in in BKK with people messing around with excess baggage and not being prepared to pay for it. MNL much better. No real complaints with Cebu Pacific - good value and I'll continue to use them.,0
2010,Cebu - Manila: My online reservation could not be accessed by staff at the airport. I was offered to take the same flight at almost three times the price I would have paid if my booking had registered correctly! The print-out of my e-ticket was considered irrelevant. Shaking heads and shrugging shoulders were the reactions I got from Cebu Pacific staff. I decided to use another airline. Despite some okay experiences with Cebu Pacific on previous occasions I will never use it again.,1
2010,BKK-MNL-BKK. Flights a little quieter in recent weeks due to the problems in Thailand. Quite large variations in price depending on precisely which days you travel. Cebu Pacific used to have very good last minute prices - not any more and the cost to change a travel date was about the same price as the original ticket. They're also cracking down hard on excess baggage - 15kg for checked in bags and 7kg hand carry. Don't expect to haggle an extra few kilos for free - and they're checking (weighing) bags again at the gate. I'll continue to use them in favour of PAL or Thai since their prices are still very competitive their reliability in my experience has been very good and NAIA-3 is by far the best MNL Terminal - just don't carry too much luggage.,0
2010,When we decided to fly from Cebu to Caticlan (Boracay) we were hesitant to fly Cebu Pacific because of horror stories we heard but opted to give it a chance. We booked and purchased our ticket 3 months in advance. Between that date and the flight date Cebu Pacific called 3 times to change the time of departure. The worst thing happened when they called 6 days before the actual flight date and told us the flight would be cancelled and they would fly us to Kalibo (3 hours away from Caticlan by bus). The airline rep tried to appease us by providing a free bus ride from Kalibo to Caticlan however this would mean we would arrive in Boracay past 7pm instead of the original schedule of 3pm. This in effect wasted 1 entire day and meant we paid for 1 night's hotel stay which was useless. Having no other recourse we agreed but to our horror upon arriving in Kalibo the bus they prepared from Kalibo to Caticlan was not big enough to accommodate all passengers. They had to fit all 13 of our group into 1 small van. Needless to say we have all vowed to never fly this airline again.,1
2010,Gensan-Manila. A pleasant flight staff a bit scarce but helpful and nice. Aircraft was clean. Flights can be delayed but that is not just Cebu. A good low cost airline to get around the Philippines.,0
2016,"Banjarmasin to Surabaya - this was an afternoon flight with Lion Air. The flight was delayed for approximately 40 minutes. The flight was smooth most of the time, except when climbing. The crew was attentive to needs of the passengers. Landing was a bit bumpy. It was raining in SUB when we landed.",0
2016,"Lion Air flight Surabaya to Banjarmasin. The flight was delayed but not even a single announcement was made by the airline. The flight was suppose to depart at 1320 but only at 1340 an announcement was made for passengers to be at the departure gate. We departed in heavy rain but it was a good take-off. The plane was a bit heavily used, it can be seen for the condition of the seat and surrounding area. There was sale of food and beverages but the choices were too little.",0
2016,Denpasar to Jakarta with Lion Air. Filthy aircraft cabin and ill groomed crew. Quite a contrast to my flight with other Indonesian budget airlines. Absolutely no service free not even a cup of water. Ground staff friendly and efficient but cabin crew can do lot more as passengers will compare them with competition available. No airshow to track the flight and announcements not very clear. Way below standards of competitor airlines.,1
2016,"Booked Lion Air for a trip to Jakarta from Singapore. Reached the check in counter at Singapore just 40 mins before flight departure and the counter staff told me that the check in timing for the flight has closed. The staff wasn't friendly and offer no other assistance for me. To other travelers, do consider Lion Air to be your last option, should you not have your trip ruined before you even leave the country.",1
2016,Denpasar to Jakarta. The flight was 90 minutes late with no information posted we had to keep asking about it. The gate area was covered in trash left by previous passengers. On our flight coming here they boarded from the front and back of the plane with no distinction for row numbers so people were pushing from both directions with attendants futilely waving people along. It has been a terrible experience all around. Pay extra for Garuda.,1
2016,"Singapore - Jakarta in early October on Lion Air. First impressions count, and Lion Air didn't deliver on most counts. What's the point of sending an email asking passengers to web check-in when the facility doesn't work? At the airport the handling agents weren't very friendly but I give them credit for ensuring a speedy boarding of the flight. On board is where the fun begins. Cabin crew were busy talking amongst themselves instead of greeting passengers. Apparently they don't seem to be interested in keeping the plane clean, as I found some wrappers lying on my assigned seat. Then the cherry to top the cake: ""this is flight XXX to Jakarta, could passengers please check their boarding passes to ensure if they are on the right flight."" First time I've heard that in my life. I suppose that is probably due to personnel mistakes made at Indonesian airports, which really makes me seriously wonder how this airline operates. On the plus side, the ticket was the cheapest among all the low-cost airlines, and my flight departed on time and arrived early in Jakarta. But that was about it. I can't say the seats were very comfortable, nor the inflight beverage bar service fantastic (they don't even have menus in the seat pockets). If I had to fly them I'd do so if I have no choice. Otherwise I'd feel much more at ease if I can fly an airline that has better service and proper safety standards.",1
2016,"I have almost every week flown Lion Air from Jakarta to Singapore, taking the first flight out. Experience begins from check-in where there is always a queue and have to wait long for your turn. (This is likely where the delays originate). The aircraft is parked at the apron and a bus will take you there from the gate, usually a short distance away. During boarding, the FA never checks boarding passes. Seats are poor in legroom and cramped. Since this is a budget airline, there is no IFE, simple F+B can be purchased. Cleanliness can be poor at times as there are uncleared rubbish in the seat pocket. The picture shows a very hazy view out of the window with lots of dust stuck between the panes. On the other hand, FAs are polite and nice, sometimes too nice or perhaps slightly lax to ensure safety on board is adhered to. However, fares are cheap and one can't complain much for that price. Just bring along a good book or a neck pillow and snooze.",1
2016,"Lion Air did their best for my flight from Bandung to Denpasar. The flight was on time. The baggage was also delivered quickly. It took less than 10 minutes for us to go out of the airport. The seat is OK for LCC, but the cabin was not clean enough. Not all cabin crew is friendly.",0
2016,"Most terrible experience and will never fly Lion Air ever again. We booked a return flight from Singapore to Bali via Jakarta and got an email to tell us our flight from Bali to JKT is delayed by an hour which cut our transit time allowance to only 1 hour instead of 2. Initially, we thought even thou rushed, we probably would be able to make it, but we were terribly wrong. When we arrive to JKT, it took us an overpriced cab (airport shuttle never came) and an hour to get from terminal 2 to terminal 3 only to be told by Lion Air staff that maybe we have to go back to terminal 2 to collect our luggage which is total misinformation. They don't even bother to check and they know nothing when you asked them. Thankfully, we did not go back to terminal 2 or else we will probably miss our connecting flight! The Lion Air flight back was even worse. True to what we believe by now, the short 1 hour transit time is definitely not enough. So during our check in at Bali to return to SG, we asked the staff how we can make it within 15 minutes from the flight landing time to the next boarding gate to board at the stipulated time printed on our boarding pass. It is totally impossible. They are not able to give us an answer how they are going to ensure we can make it to the next flight. We had to demand to see the supervisor who told me Icould disagree with the flight changes but that is not true because there is no option I could indicate i disagree with the flight changes and the email about the schedule change only came later after I booked the flight. Finally he said the staff at jkt will be there to fetch us to our connecting flight. And so, flight at Bali was delayed with no information to let the passengers know. We are supposed to board at 3.30pm and we only boarded 2 hours later with no announcements. We had to also change gates for the boarding and again no announcement at all to inform passengers. It was totally chaotic. When we asked if our next connecting flight is delayed since our first leg of flight is delayed and won't reach in time to take the next flight from JKT to SG, Lion Air staff said no which means we will miss the next flight! In the end, they made all the passengers in the connecting flight (those waiting are not connecting passengers) wait for us for 2 hours to board the plane and take off. Food and beverages sold are very limited.",1
2016,Another classic Lion Air flight for the two hour trip to Bali from Jakarta. The flight was smooth and seamless with cabin crew barely appearing down the aisle as they hanged out at the front behind the curtain. To be fair there was no service to be given besides the safety briefing and every one just got down to some sleep. Lion Air possibly has the tightest leg room seat in the industry with needing to buckle down their legs under the seat in front to fit them in. All in all a cheap flight which included 20kg baggage and a modern jet. Not bad.,0
2016,"Would never fly with them again. Booked business class from Lombok to Denpasar as nothing else was available, received only economy when we got there. Wings Air flight was delayed by 4hrs with no information provided whatsoever. We had to ask 4 times in order to be informed of the delay. Staff was extremely rude. Never book with them if you have a connecting flight!",1
2016,"Jakarta to Singapore With Lion Air. The ticket was very cheap and that is the reason why I choose Lion Air. The flight was a bit late for take off but landed on time. The check in was smooth and the ground staff was kind and quite helpful. Cabin staff cabin were welcoming and friendly to us. The seat were as normal as taking a low cost carrier. Overall, it is quite ok for this flight.",0
2016,"The Lion Air flight departed from Main Terminal, KLIA. Check in was simple. Boarding only started 10mins before ETD and was really slow. The Boeing 737-900ER used was old. The cabin crew was ok. The seat pitch is a minimum of 28"", and even for an Asian like me, I feel so uncomfortable throughout the flight which was about 2hrs. Lion is a budget, no-frills airline, thus, no IFE, no meals but a 20kg luggage allowance is provided free. Flight arrived 10mins behind schedule and it takes another 15mins for the aircraft ladder to arrive for disembarkation as Lion utilises the remote stand for cheaper airport charges. Once disembarked, waited for another 15mins for the transporting bus to arrive. Luckily luggage arrived fast. It was a terrible experience!",1
2016,"Surabaya to Jakarta with Lion Air. 12 hours before, I already check in on Lion Air website check in. I already selected the seat then I chose aisle seat - at the boarding time I didn't get my selected seat! If Lion Air can check in on website 12 hours before flight, why didn't I get my selection seat? Other people who did not check-in on website (the other people check in 2hours before flight) got my seat! Lion Air is also often delayed and the quality and the service is very bad!",1
2016,"We flow from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta and Jakarta to Singapore with Lion Air. I didn't expect much in terms of customer care and service and choose this airline merely for its cheap offers. However, I was quite impressed of this airline for several reasons: 1) There was no cancellation or any delay of our two legs with Lion Air. 2) I found the crew very polite, they had a smile on their faces while welcoing passengers during boarding. 3) I was also very impressed witnessing the staff helping passengers actively with storing their big and heavy bags onto overhead bins, this is a touch that you wouldn't see with European crews. 4) Crew engaged in emergency instructions. They briefed passengers in the exit rows about their duties. There was a seat empty on the exit row so a cabin member was asking people if they would like to sit in the exit row. 5) Crew were not good with English skills, their airline magazine also has no english content at all. 6) Price was amazing compared to other carriers. Full service carrirers such as Malaysia and Garuda wanted 4 times as much money as Lion Air. 7) Seat was comfortable with old fashinoned leather which I do prefer over these new but thin and hard seats from many carriers. Leg space was limited but acceptable for a 2 hours flight.",0
2016,"Booked a Lion Air flight from Bali to Jakarta because I had a connecting flight to Europe 4 hrs later after arriving to Jakarta. When checking status of flights same day as I should fly, there's no such flight - checking mail and in the spambox is a mail from Lion Air (late from previous day), saying that my flight is cancelled and I have a ticket for a flight 1 hr later. Fine I thought, mailed the Lion Airs customer service and asked if they know if the flight is on time and how I best can take me from terminal 3 to terminal 2 in Jakarta and explained that is important for me to check in 2 hrs before my connecting flight to Europe. Only answer I got was that it is not possible for me to cancel a flight per e-mail and no other information. Mailed them back asking what kind of customer service is this when not answering any of the questions I asked and told them that I'm not trying to cancel my flight, just trying to make sure that I will get to terminal 2 in time, of course no answer to my second mail. Got to Denpasar 3 hrs before my flight to Jakarta just to meke sure everything's ok, checking in with my old ticket and was told that my flight is 1 hr later as I already knew, asked if the flight is on time, they assured me so. Boarding half an hour later and departed 1 h 15 mins late, landed, waited for my baggage 45 mins, tried to take a shuttle bus to other terminal, it never came, took an overpriced taxi, but it was worth it, and I got to the check in 1 hr before my connecting flight. Only just made it and never been so stressed. Worst airline I ever used and the customer service is a joke! I learned a lesson also, always read feedback before booking anything, if I'd checked feedback on Lion Air before booking I'd chosen another company, I suggest you do the same.",1
2016,"Jakarta to Denpasar and a complete disaster with Lion Air. The flight was 1.5 hours late with no information provided at all. When asked, ground staff shrugged, were rude and said they don't know. All this for a 9pm flight. On the airplane itself, they said the lateness was due to ""operational reasons"". I will never fly them again and wouldn't recommend them either.",1
2016,"Denpasar to Jakarta with Lion Air was a terrible experience. The departure time from Denpasar was 18.15. At the time of check in at 17.15 I am told that flight is on time. Then at 1745 we are told that flight is 30 mins late, and finally the flight departs at 20.45. It landed at 21:50 and we were then left on tarmac for 30 minutes waiting for a bus to pick up and take us to the terminal.",1
2016,"The Lion Air flight was delayed for an hour. The boarding gate were overcrowded as many flights to different cities were also delayed. Flight was smooth. The cabin was comfortable. Luckily it was a short haul flight, so I didn't mind the short seat pitch. You get what you paid. With low ticket price, I wouldn't have high expectation.",1
2015,"You think I would have learned my lesson after 90% or so of flights I have taken with Lion Air have been delayed. Now sitting on the floor in the crowded waiting lounge as no seats are available with another 2 hour delay, just announced at take off schedule. Not fun with 2 small children. Last month my return flight to Bali was delayed by 3 hours each way. Also don't bother with trying to check in on the app. It does not work. I will never book with this airline again. Not worth the problems for the cheaper price.",1
2015,"In a recent business trip to Singapore, my usual airline was booked full. I decided to try Lion Air. I am disabled and require a wheelchair for long walks. That is always a challenge for any airline to get right. My usual airline, AirAsia, does not charge for a wheelchair if arranged up front. Lion charges a whopping 30.00 SGD for a wheelchair. Now my first piece of advice, do not use Lion Air is you need help getting around. I found that the words ""Customer"" and ""Service"" are fairly unknown. Lion is especially bad with that concept. If there was a zero star rating I would readily give them that rating. I am an American, Indonesia extends what is called a ""Visa on Arrival"" to USA and some other countries. When I went to get my boarding pass the Lion Air employee refused to give me a boarding pass because I did not have an Indonesian Visa in my passport. I tried explaining that I get the visa on arrival. He still refused. I asked for his manager and explained it to her. Finally after much deliberation (and showing where I have done this many times before) they issued my boarding pass. The young man apologized that he was only doing his job. Well I am sorry too but warning people of poor service in this forum is mine. In all fairness most of the people were nice but still did not take care of the customer. One young man at Jakarta was helpful but only after paying him an additional 100,000 IDR.",1
2015,"We have been trying to get out of Gili island for a couple of days. Due to the volcanic activity all flights were cancelled. We called Lombok and Lion Air informed that one or two flights were operational so head there to find out it was fake. We take a boat from Lombok to Bali and reach the Lion Air counter at 2am. We waited at the desk until someone asked us to not sit at their counter(although lots of other flight counters had no problem with the same) we get out and return to the counter at 5 for cancelling our ticket and issuing new ones for which we were charged an exorbitant amount. 8 million rp! Being extremely tired, we agree. One of the payments didn't process on the credit card so we went to their Lion Air customer service. They fleeced us there too with bad exchange rates. Post that we go in and since one from three tickets was yet to be cancelled and reissued we did that at the machine. The cancellation for which was less than 5 million! And now the flight is delayed. Not surprised. Never taking this airline again. We have met amazing people in Indonesia who gave us the best service except Lion Air.",1
2015,"The cabin was very hot. We were waiting on the runway for about half an hour, after that, they announced problems with the air-conditioning, but said it would be ok after take-off. Another half an hour, another announcement, only in Indonesian. Everyone onboard got angry (the increasing heat did not help) and started exiting the plane. No staff were able to explain what was going on - they only word was 'sorry'. People deboarded and were arguing while standing on the runway for another 15 minutes. Then we were shuffled to back to the terminal and told to wait for a replacement aircraft. Their ineptitude to tell us what's going on really surprised me. Never flying with Lion Air again.",1
2015,"Flight was scheduled at 06.20. Arrived early at the airport around 03.30 am. The information gate  ""check in open"". But nobody at the check in counter. And when I asked the airport security they said it will be open at 05.00 am. I was hoping to be able to check in sooner to be able to rest at the gate. No difference from taking a bus from a bus terminal.",1
2015,"Nias to Medan with Lion Air, and I arrived 2 hours prior to my 9:30am domestic flight only to be told it had been cancelled and they had very kindly put me on the 7am flight - but failed to send an email to inform me! Then they charged me extra to put my surfboards on a 10:30 flight which was delayed by a further hour. This resulted in me missing my international flight. No compensation, zero customer service.",1
2015,"My friend and I booked a flight from Krabi Airport to Bangkok for a very good price with Lion Air subsidiary Thai Lion Air. Seen the mostly negative reviews of Lion Air itself and were a bit hesitant to fly, but figured it would probably be alright. The experience was actually better than I expected. Yes, we did have one of Lion Air's notorious delays (about 25 minutes) and no, they did not mention it nor apologize. However, the flight itself was allright. Seats and legroom are comparable to other low-cost airlines and we comfortable enough for me (I'm just under 1.80 m). Staff are friendly and in-flight food and drinks are inexpensive. I don't know anything about the quality since I only had tea. Overall, I can say that if you don't mind a little delay, Thai Lion Air can be a good budget-concious choice.",0
2015,"The flight was shown as on-time but when I approached the desk and was told by staff it was delayed by 10 minutes, then told 20 minutes, an hour later we were asked to walk to another gate to a replacement plane. Once seated another passenger showed me his boarding pass that was the same seat as mine. The cabin crew tried telling me I was in the wrong seat, despite me showing my pass that she claimed was one row. I pointed out that row was already full, and I offered to move to the adjacent seat next seat. No explanation or was forthcoming for duplicate boarding passes.",1
2015,Flying Lion Air (operated by Wings Abadi Air) from Kupang to Atambua on 16th June. It was nice journey onboard although it is a short flight. New ATR72-600 had quite nice legroom. Price was very affordable. Flight attendants have nice uniforms accompanied by wonderful smile. I will recommend and choose Wings Air in short flight again.,0
2014,Flown with Lion Air CGK-SIN-CGK on 22 and 24 respectively using their (rather) new single isle Boeing 737-900. Flown with about almost 1.5 hours of delay for the return leg but it is Changi so I won't complain. What I notice about this airline is that they provide more (just a little more) room for International flights. Had no problem fitting in my legs (I am 184cm tall) a little cramped but nothing compared to my last CGK-DPS-CGK flight. That being mentioned I can't actually say much about the level of comfort that I get from LCCs you get what you pay! Now lowering down my standard to the level of LCCs Lion Air is a pleasant airline to fly with. What they can do to improve passenger satisfaction is to improve their punctuality. Lion Air has been the master of all delayed flights and with their new 700 aircraft's in order they can improve their means of operation too.,0
2014,Bangkok (Don Mueang) - Hat Yai return with Thai Lion Air. A mix experience from pleasant to fair enough. Booking system and online check - in fine their website is easy. Staff very friendly polite and professional. Aircraft is brand new 737-900er with Sky interior look nice and exit row are comfortable. On the return flight my preferred seat request is refused despite it being available regular seat are tight cramp and very uncomfortable. Hot meal sold on board had run out  only instant noodle or snack available. Crew are apologetic with the problem and tried to accommodate other request. Punctuality is perfect. Expense wise their fare are cheap and include all those miscellaneous cost (eg. tax and VAT) 15kgs load luggage free. Will not hesitate to fly them again at this cost and level of service.,0
2014,Not that I expect much from LCCs however my Lion Air flight from Bali to Yogyakarta was Bad. Terrible online system. Difficult to make payment with non-Indonesian credit card. Cannot select seats online and no online check-in. Disorganized at airport in Bali where they basically re-entered all the data while checking in. Delayed flights. Onboard the absolute smallest legroom I've ever seen. Thankfully there are some positives as well: they have new 737-900ER's with Sky Interiors the flights are short and cheap and flight attendants have nice uniforms accompanied by wonderful smiles. For the rest they have a lot of work to do to be able to compete with Air Asia.,1
2014,It was nice journey onboard Thai Lion Air (SL8201) on route Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok Don Mueang. New Boeing 737-900 had not enough legroom but it was quite nice. The problem was that our flight was delayed about 15 h and there was no any announcement about it. Another problem is that during booking I couldn't choose my seat or check-in online. Price was very affordable. I will recommend and choose Thai Lion Air again.,0
2013,Flying LionAir (operated by Wings Abadi Air) from Bali to Komodo Airport on 7th Oct. What an absolute nightmare! It started 3 days before trying to re-confirm my flight with them as it has been booked 9 months earlier from the UK and I had an email advising slight schedule change the day earlier. We arrive at Bali airport to be met with chaos at check in most disorganised airline ever (and I have travelled many times in the Far East and Africa). It took about an hour to get to the front of the queue when we did the girl checking us in seemed to be having a few problems with the booking but eventually checked us in and took our baggage and issued our boarding passes. We arrive at the gate at the required time to be met again by chaos it appeared all Lion Air and Wings Air flights go from this gate I confirmed with desk clerk we were at the right gate and we sat down and waited the boarding time arrived and past I went back to the desk as we approached the departure time to again be told right gate please wait! The departure time now had passed and it was about an hour past departure time a few flights had been boarded but no news of ours none of the departure boards were working so again I went up for a third time to find out what was happening asked another person to be advised 'Flight Cancelled' and you have to go back to check in. I got the clerk to assist us back to the airline desk and we found out the flight had actually been cancelled the night before they never should have checked us in and took our luggage. The airline were not able to rebook us either on to another flight so we lost our trip to Komodo. The worst of it is we were not the only ones this had happened to it appears other people had been checked in onto flights that had also been cancelled to other destinations. I would not recommend.,1
2013,Checked in the night before it simply said schedule changed and please call this number. Found out they had moved me onto the morning flight which was less than 12 hrs later. Now what would happen to people who do not online check-in I hate to fathom. I received no email or text regarding this change. Arrived at the airport the next morning and explained that I had a whole day planned in Yogyharata and because of this flight change I also would now have a 14 hr transit (instead of 2) in Denpasar. I was reasonable and asked for use of a lounge in Denpasar to wait it out. The counter staff explained that there was nothing else they could do because they do not have a lounge in Denpasar. I simply left it and will do any further talking with my feet.,1
2013,"Arrived slightly late for this flight and was told it was on time and that check in had closed and I had to buy a new ticket. When I got to the gate I found out my original flight was in fact late but response was inadequate and uncaring. Boarding was late and when I finally got on I was told that the flight was full and I had to check in my carry on. When I told them I had a laptop in there I was told to take it out and sit with the laptop on my lap. I asked for a bag to put my computer in but got nothing. We waited an additional hour on the runway with no explanation. When I asked the steward he said ""I'm not sure maybe it's because they're backed up"". This was not the first time I've endured terrible delays and ridiculous responses from staff. I will never fly Lion again.",1
2013,Flew from DPS to Yogyakarta. Early morning flight boarding and take off on time. Smooth flight on a new B737. Requested exit row seat and was allocated this.,1
2013,"Lion Air (operated by Wings Air) Flight from Bali to Lombok was cancelled and then delayed for 6 hours. Check in and boarding processes were chaotic. Information updates were either non existent met with shrugs or told anything to keep us ""satisfied"". Similar experience on return flight but only 3.5 hours late. Avoid these two airlines at all costs.",1
2013,Booked KUL-CGK route back in January 24th. Been flying with this airline numerous times before but this was the first international flight. A few hours before my flight I decided to reschedule to Jan 25th due to some inevitable matters in KL then I tried to call the local customer centre number. I managed to reschedule without much hassles certainly with some additional fees (to be paid at the airport). The following day I checked in at Lion Air kiosk in the airport paid the fees and got my boarding pass. It is evidently cheaper than the infamous low-cost carrier Air Asia in some routes. Also worth noting that being a low cost carrier in KUL Lion Air - unlike Air Asia and several others - remains a few (if not the only one) of its kind to land in KLIA satellite terminal (NOT LCCT) means it is accessible more conveniently from KL City Centre.,0
2013,Flew CGK to PAD on 29 January 2013. Terminal 1 departure. Terminal is old and has little to offer. Hot and humid only departure area is AC but has far too few seats and was cramped noisy and chaotic. Flight was delayed for almost 2 hours and no announcements were made. Flight even disappeared from the information board. Airline officials offered very little assistance and only told us to wait. Finally a stampede of rushing people as sign of boarding and also this time no announcement. No English information provided. Plane was new 737-800. Seats cramped but felt new. In my few very poor service. Its cheap but it comes with a lot of suffering.,1
2013,KUL-CGK-KUL. Excellent flight. The trip was smooth. As I am tall I always like to ask for the aisle seat or the emergency seats. I always get my request. 3 times/day schedules which suits me fine. The airline leaves from KLIA proper not from the low cost terminal in Malaysia.,0
2013,Flew LOP-DPS-CGK 8th Jan. Arrived LOP at 12 for flight - delayed 2.5 hours no announcement or reason given. Told my bag would be transferred in DPS to go direct to CGK. Land in DPS 15.00 for my CGK flight at 15.00 run to check in desk - flight delayed until 15.20. Explain I have an international Qatar flight to Doha at 18.25 told my bag was made priority to come off first and ground staff would be there to assist me when I landed. Land at 15.00 in terminal 3 need to get to terminal 2. No one waiting to assist me another 6 people in the same situation. Took 10 mins for several staff members to understand what's going on and help. Waited at terminal 2 for bags but never turned up. Forced to take Qatar flight without luggage. Check in your bags at your own risk.,1
2013,DPS-CGK. Departure hall at DPS was very chaotic due to the construction of the new airport. Lion Air ground staff very unorganized. Seats were narrow with literally no legroom whatsoever and I am only 5 ft 9. We did not have any other options on this route due to high season but I would have flown to SIN or other destination and then reach Jakarta instead. They have newer aircraft's in their fleet several Boeing 737-900ER so overall cabin was still very clean. That would be the only plus I can summarize from my experience.,1
2012,Arrived to the airport for check in with Lion Air we needed some assistance with the visa process for Vietnam and we were basically told there was nothing that we could do but miss our flight and try to switch our flight to another time. We decided to do some research ourselves when we realized there was a way to catch our original timed flight. The crew members were extremely rude and didn't want to help us resolve our problem. Once we figured things out for ourselves and then ran to board the plane we found out the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The lack of customer service and disorganization has made us lose any hope we had in flying with Lion Air.,1
2012,Flew on Lion Air both legs Surabaya-Jakarta-Surabaya. Both flights were on time even early. For me whose height 180 cm Lion Air's seat pitch was not that bad comfortable enough. Check-in staff were fast and friendly. I did city check in. Since they have a large number of flights to almost all Indonesian cities and a high frequencies on their routes I will strongly recommend to fly on Lion Air for domestic trip.,0
2012,Have used Lion Air several times on domestic flights. It's a budget airline so cheap prices. Facilities as you'd might expect are quite standard for low cost carrier: no onboard complimentary meals no IFE cramped seat pitch (unless for several seats along the emergency exits) narrow aisles and needless to say chaotic upon boarding and unboarding as it is often full. Flight itself sometimes experiences delays but usually departs and arrives on time. FAs in general are quite friendly. If you have a rather limited budget this airline is worth considering for travel among Indonesian cities.,0
2012,Jakarta to Singapore. Have flown this route both ways frequently and usually end up with Lion Air as they're the cheapest after you've factored in the extras with competing LCCs. Appreciate that what they say on the website is what you pay. Plane was quite new B737-900 with dreadfully cramped seats. No IFE or anything to eat or drink which was not a problem with a 1 hr 40m approx flight. Check-in at Jakarta Airport was swift. Flight was more or less on time and I will definitely use Lion again while they keep their prices as they are.,0
2012,DPS-JOG return. Outbound we had one of the new 737-900ERs with mood lighting on return an older model. Both ways I was given an exit row seat which was much appreciated - standard seating is 28 inch pitch. Both flights were absolutely on time. Was tempted by Air Asia's new and slightly cheaper service but Lion Air's schedule (leave early morning return late evening) suited better. No complaints.,0
2012,Jakarta - Manado. I would try avoid travelling with Lion Air if I could. Luckily my flight was on time. Flight attendants were not friendly at all. It was a bit like a market up there when they were selling food and as they didn't really control how many cabin bags you can take they were hardly any space to put my one bag in the cabin.,1
2012,Balikpapan-Manado 18 July 2012. New Fleet B737-800ER nice interior. Departure and arrival was on time. The service was standard. I always choose a seat near emergency door. Cabin crew handling was nice.,0
2012,PLM - CGK with Boeing 737-900ER . Cheap ticket prices. Departure on time. Friendly cabin crew. Distance between the seat is quite narrow. No in-flight snacks.,0
2012,"CGK to UPG on June 17th 2012. Booking was good. It was an average experience yes the plane was good (737-900ER with Boeing sky interior) seat pitch was okay. I have no issue with the ""no f&b flight"". It was the worst landing I've experienced. On the return flight on board the older 737-900ER seat pitch was poor and the landing was just the same as before.",1
2012,CGK-SIN return. Cheapest fares compare to competitors with 20kg baggage allowance. delayed for 20 to 30 mins for both legs without any reason or announcement. Online check-in not available for international flights. Got brand new 737-900ER for both legs. Seat pitch quite tight BoB very limited FA's just doing their job and the inflight magazine is the only thing to entertain you.,0
2012,Medan to Padang. Flight attendants very polite I was able to choose a seat with online check-in however their fleet is quite old (737-400). Flight from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur (737-900 new fleet) you can not do online check-in for an international flight so I arrived at the airport early. Service and landing at KLIA was good.,0
2012,"Lion Air 8pm flight Bengkulu to Jakarta March 2. Flight 2.5 hours late leaving. No announcements had to ask for constantly changing information. No compensation when one customer complained and at last minute Padang food appeared with no implements to eat and way too late. Onboard they briefly apologized as flight late for ""operational reasons"". My understanding is this is a common occurrence for this flight. This airline has no customer care or communications capability.",1
2012,SUB-SIN and SIN-SUB. Cheap price since it's a new route with high load factor. Cramped seats for SIN bound flights and spacious seat on return flight in emergency exit row and bulkhead which you can ask for free. Only snacks and mineral water offered at expensive prices and crews only provide immigration cards during the flight. Airline's magazine is only form of entertainment.,1
2012,Jakarta to Tarakan via Balikpapan. Seat pitch is the smallest I have seen on any airline. Boarding in Jakarta was from both the front door and rear door. They have assigned seats so people boarding from the rear door were trying to move up to the front of the plane. Needless to say this is impossible. The amount of pushing and shoving is brutal. Left 23 minutes late due to boarding. Inflight nothing is offered on a 2+ hour flight. Flight attendants are young and stay in the galley with the curtain closed. The 737-900ER holds over 225 people. They only have 3 toilets - that's it.,1
2012,Jakarta-Kuala Lumpur and Singapore-Jakarta. Check-in crews were okay. Most announcements were recorded no meal or drink. A choice of orange juice or water would be appreciated. Seat was very hard magazine onboard boring and crews weren't interested in serving passengers. The only good thing is the value of money (if you buy tickets early).,1
2012,CGK-SIN-CGK. The seat was terrible with very little leg room the FA's disappeared during the flight no presence at all and the toilet was dirty. On the way back to Jakarta the air conditioner was extremely cold however the mood lighting gave a little comfort and that was the only positive thing I took from the flight.,1
2011,Mataram Lombok to Denpasar. We arrived at the airport 15.00 for our 17.40 flight and according to staff and the monitors the flight was on time. As the departure time passed passengers went to check-in staff and asked what was happening we were informed the flight would be delayed and would depart at 22.15. No reason given for the delays. 22.15 came and still no sign of a flight. At 22.50 I went to the check-in staff and demanded to know what was happening. Nobody knew and they informed us the flight must have been cancelled and we would probably be taken to Denpasar the following morning. Finally a time came in at 00.15am some 10 hrs after we had checked in. I am angry that staff did not keep us informed of what was happening and still today we do not know why the plane was delayed more than 8 hours. Extremely poor service by not only Lion Air but the ground staff as well.,1
2011,Jakarta to Solo trip was horrible. Drinks are not given but sold they aren't cold and they don't serve the drinks with ice either. Extremely loud announcements no entertainment. The plane was pretty dirty and my seat pocket didn't have the magazine. In my row only one seat pocket had a magazine.,1
2011,SIN-CGK-MDC. Flights on time. Brand new planes nice looking interior. They accept US issued credit cards unlike other carriers. 20 kg of luggage is included in the price of ticket.,0
2011,SIN-CGK-SIN. Booking is to the point. Unlike other carriers offering you - upgrades for baggage allowance better seat inflight meal and so on. 1hr delay is normal especially in CGK on evening flight. Seat pocket is dirty and not cleaned from the previous leg. Overall recommended if what you are looking for is just to get from point A to point B.,0
2011,Manado to Makassar and to Jakarta. Nothing was offered on the first leg not even a cup of water. We did not see the crew at all. On the 2nd leg only 1 cup of water given and a small selection of snacks for sale after that. Again your don't see the crew at all after distribution of items. Disembarkation through the rear exit while the stewardess stood leaning against the wall with her arms folded. The only good thing about the flight and airline was that it was on time the seating was really very cramped.,1
2011,CGK-DPS-CGK. They take you from A to B and that's it. Web check-in was not functioning. Last minute change on departure gate. Delays seems to be normal when flying with them the only positive was the cheap fare.,1
2011,My trip from Changi to Jakarta was pleasant I choose the seat near the emergency door and the leg stretch is very good. The trip back was nice and smooth it is a no gimmick airline. For me you've got what you pay.,0
2011,Pangkal Pinang (Bangka) to Jakarta what should be a one-hour flight. Flight delayed by 4.5 hours and almost no information given. I eventually found out that the plane was still in Jakarta awaiting the pilot. After a one-hour delay we were given chicken and rice (horrid if you're a vegetarian but that's Indonesia for you!). After that nothing - not even a word about compensation. The staff were fine onboard - it's the management who need a serious shake- up if they think a 4.5 hour delay for a 1-hour flight is in any way acceptable.,0
2011,JOG to Lombok via SUB and DPS. Flights operated by Wings air new ATR planes good staff no food for sale as flights just over 1 hour. All flights on time. Very clean planes.,0
2011,SIN-SGN on new 737-900ER. Flight wasn't full. Small snack box with a bun and cake provided plus a drink. After clearing stewardess no where to be seen. Little regards to safety with mobile phones ringing in mid flight. Flight departed on time and arrived with minimal fuss. Good thing is it departs from Terminal 1 in Singapore.,1
2011,Flew with Lion few times while I was in Indonesia for holiday. CGK-MDC MDC-DPS-MDC. It wasn't a very good experience checking-in at Soekarno Hatta crowded and very unorganised! Could hardly move and food wasn't included. Flights were on time though which was a good thing. It wasn't a bad experience but wasn't the best either.,1
2011,SIN-CGK on new B737-900. Booking was good website efficient and easy. Flight was delayed for about 45 minutes without any notice. During take off and landing there is one passenger who never set his seat upright and FAs don't bother to remind him. Seat pitch very poor. Baggage claim at CGK is a havoc. Baggage carousel is changed without any notice and a very long time to have your baggage on the belt.,1
2010,Flight Jakarta to Bali was 2 hours delayed. Return flight 3 hours delayed. I tried to call their service center several times but no one answers the phone. No notification of delays until you get to the airport. Time is extremely important when traveling. It is obvious that despite their reasonably low fares they don't care for their customers. I will never fly this airline again.,1
2010,Jakarta-Jogya wasn't a pleasant experience. Plane 1hour late - no info/announcements. Departure lounge overflowing with passengers from 3 late Lion flights. Plane (B737) dirty and shabby with indifferent cabin crew (no checks to see bags properly stowed seats upright for landing/take off etc). Website is good but this doesn't make up for other problems.,1
2010,"First pro is their web site very easy and no hidden costs the spring up as you progress into the booking process. Aircraft mostly new and clean with friendly staff. Flight service is limited seat pitch 28"" for coach and 32 for business. Very tight however was on request was given a long leg seat with a smile and no charge.",0
2009,CGK - Lombok DPS - CGK on new 737-900. Using the domestic terminal in Jakarta it was pretty hectic. One thing that bothered me the crew did not check the name on the boarding pass with our ID. The flight to Lombok was delayed for an hour while we were onboard. Seats and service were decent since we were using the old plane. Getting back from Bali to Jakarta was terrible. Using the new B737-900 the seats was seriously tight - have never flown any plane with seats that uncomfortable.,1
2009,"CGK-DEN-CGK. CGK-DEN delayed by 2 hours to 11am due to technical problems so Lion Air gave a lunch box - not bad but not appetizing. I went to the Manager on Duty to ask for an earlier flight on another airline (as I was planning to return the same day) but they couldn't find a seat on another airline. When I reminded her that Garuda had a flight leaving soon she said she didn't check with Garuda. They were definitely overwhelmed with complaints. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I've ever been on. I'm only 171cm (5'7"") but my knees touched the seat in front of me. No service onboard not even a glass of water or anybody going around the cabin selling anything. If they dont improve the service I wont use them anymore.",1
2009,DPS-CGK new B737-900. The aircraft condition although it is brand new but dirty many spots on the leather seat trash on the carpet which shows that they do not clean it properly. FA only did the safety demonstration do the snack & drinks selling and the rest of the flight they chit chat on the pantry. Some of the FA announcement are recorded. Another things some passengers are still doing some activity while the fasten seat belt sign is on and the FA did not warn the passenger to go back to their seat. I believe that Lion Air should upgrade their services and FA skills/knowledge.,1
2008,CGK to KUL return. Didn't expect much as had poor experiences with Lion in the past but was pleasantly surprised. Check-in very orderly both flights arrived absolutely on time and the fare was very competitive indeed. No food or IFE. Everything else was no-frills - but seats are allocated and flight operates to the proper passenger terminal at KUL and not the awful LCCT so I'd say that Lion has the edge over the other low-cost operator on this route Air Asia.,1
2008,"SIN - CGK one way flight on time with new B737-900ER. Seat pitch was very tight (around 28"") - very hard to sit and move around. The 1.5hr journey was like a shuttle bus - no services and you cannot even purchase any foods or drinks. FAs were attentive as call button answered immediately.",1
2008,SIN-DPS-SIN both flights using the new B737-900ER. Cabin clean bright and airy. I was impressed that food (hot meal dessert and salad - all served on a tray) + drinks were served for both flights. Pity that load factor for both legs was less than 40% and no inflight entertainment was offered at all. It's a great flying experience overall.,1
2008,Singapore-Bali on new 737-900. Low fare with Good Service. Seat a bit hard Food provided is enough but not nice. Return Flight delay about 50 min. Overall still satisfied with Lion Air.,1
2008,JOG - CGK. I guess this airline is fair. Our flight was cancelled and the flight we were put onto was about 3 hours late (it was due to leave about 2 hours before our flight). But they were very efficient in transferring us onto another flight. They even got everybody a donut and water. So full credit to the Jogjakarta customer services.,1
2008,DPS-CGK-DPS. Both legs using new Boeing 737-900 ER. Departed on-time even early. Cabin was clean. No more free drink. All foods and drinks are for purchase. Seat pitch quite tight. Overall I was satisfied flying on Lion Air.,1
2008,SIN-DPS-SIN on 737-900ER. Latest entrant on the 'prized' route and had to take advantage of low fares not available for past two years. Single class cabin seats rather hard but typical of such carriers slight recline snack box and free drinks provided. Returning flight at 12am was delayed for 2 hours ground staff provided mini dinner snack box which most passengers left untouched. Delay was informed upon check in. Cabin crew pleasant call button answered almost immediately drinks requests tended to quickly. The major difference between Lion and the rest of the budget carriers is that they do not hawk duty free sales so once meal service is completed passengers are left undisturbed. Both flights not completely full despite the very attractive fares. One reason could be due to the bad publicity Indonesian carriers have been receiving. Extremely value-for-money service something we should not take for granted in these times.,1
2006,Padang-Jakarta sector - airline seems more like a shuttle. No food was provided  but the ubiquitous water cup which you get on every public transport in Indonesia.,1

2005,The service was good compared to other value airlines. The food served was enough and I was contented. I really think that the airline was indeed perfect and more preferable to me.,1

2016,"Delhi to Hyderabad with IndiGo. My flight was cancelled and I was moved to another flight. Apart from this, everything was good apart from the cost of the meals. I didn't find the coffee and noodles too special and weren't great. New flight was on time and comfortable. Not much to talk about but was good as far as the budget airline tag goes.",0
2016,"I have been having consistent horrible experiences with Indigo regarding delays. I was travelling from Cochin to Bangalore - the flight was supposed to depart at 8.45 pm and it departed the next morning at 2.05 am. A week later, I was returning from Trivandrum to Bangalore - the flight was supposed to depart at 8.15 pm and it departed the next morning at 12.05 am. Today, my wife was supposed to travel to Chennai from Bangalore. The departure time is 7.20 am, the revised departure is at 9:15 am. Indigo used to be consistently punctual. When I speak to the staff, I hear that the fleet is overbooked and you are trying to optimize. I will look at Indigo only as a last option.",1
2016,"Yet another comfortable, friendly and smooth IndiGo flight flying from Pune to Bangkok via Kolkata. A caveat: In a hundred international flights into Bangkok in the past two decades, for the first time ever in my experience, an airline (IndiGo) did not have Thai immigration forms. Anybody who has been through immigration at Suvarnbhumi expects a wait of up to one hour. So, to not have immigration forms on board a flight can develop into an even longer wait. Come on, IndiGo! Otherwise, as usual, a flawless IndiGo flight.",0
2016,Delhi to Port Blair via Kolkata. IndiGo used to be my best option because of its on time schedule. But due to a few problems and  delays I chose other options like Vistara. On 12th November 2016 I again chose IndiGo for a family holiday in Port Blair from Delhi. I was very happy and satisfied with all the services. Even the flight was ahead of its schedule and the cabin crew was warm and the hospitality was just amazing. I'm again a loyal traveller with IndiGo now.,0
2016,"Another flawless flight. Flew Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata with IndiGo. On time, both departures and both arrivals. Smooth boarding from Bangkok. Impeccable onboard service und attitude. Chaotic boarding at Kolkata: a long queue formed at boarding. Fine. Then an announcement was made by a ground staff member, in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 16-30 would board first. Since the announcement was barely audible, people waiting in the queue were confused, thus standing in line, not knowing what to do. Ground crew member - only one IndiGo staff manning their pre-boarding desk/area - did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board. People waiting. In the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person, spoke to him and were allowed to board. No idea if these people were going to occupy rows 16-30. Nothing happening; line not moving; IndiGo staff still looking as if he was in a daze. No repeat announcement, in an audible voice, re rows 16-30. Since I was in line, had a seat in row 21, I broke the queue, presented my boarding pass, and passed security. Don't know what happened after that. IndiGo needs to get its act together in this area. Inflight service again impeccable.",0
2016,"Bangalore to Nagpur with IndiGo. On this trip to India, I was fortunate enough to try 3 different airlines - Air India, Jet Airways and Indigo. Indigo definitely scored best in terms of its modern fleet, however not recommended for international passengers due to its baggage restrictions. The fares aren't that cheap compared to other airlines, however Air India allows the most baggage weight. The staff are young and attractive, but truly inexperienced to handle situations. Personally didn't have a choice, since IndiGo had so many direct flights to remote cities.",0
2016,"Indigo Mumbai to Delhi return. The outward journey started with a smooth and easy check in at Mumbai. Flight on time. The aircraft was clean and as per Indigo standards. What was very poor on this flight was the crew. The leading stewardess in particular seemed to sit and do not much while the other crew worked. Shame to see Indigo crew standards falling. It was also a morning flight but they had none of the breakfast options available - Ramen noodles were my best option. Return flight had a great crew but the Delhi airport check in was a nightmare. Long lines, people cutting lines. No Indigo crew to help. Quite a disappointing and sad experience. The days of looking for Indigo flights to book may be over.",1
2016,"Ranchi to Kolkata with IndiGo. I travel frequently with this airline, and trust me folks this is the best you can get in terms of value for money compared to other airlines in India. Indigo has been my personal favourite for short flights. The flight crew is fairly good. I'm 6'1, and I find the seat compact but this is the same for all LCCs and not ideal on long flights. Cabin staff appearance is smart, they are courteous but not always consistent. There is no inflight entertainment on these flights. Short flights they are perfect, Medium duration okay, long flights not recommended.",0
2016,"Great airline. I had 3 domestic flights with Indigo: Udaipur-Mumbai, Mumbai-Goa and Goa-Delhi. Booking in its website was easy and prices were competetive. Check-in at the airports was easy and fast - Indigo had many counters open in all 3 airports. Flights departured with no delays of more than 5 minutes. The airplanes looked new and very clean. Staff was nice and helpful. On two occasions I ordered a sandwich (about 250 rupees) which was quiet tasty to my surprise. The only downside that I can think of is that the seats are not very comfortable, but it's a low cost airline and flights usually last only 1-2 hours, so it's not such a big deal. Highly recommended.",0
2016,Flew from Mumbai to Bangalore with IndiGo. The check-in was good and everything went smoothly. The flight departed and arrived on-time. The cabin crew are very polite. The cushioning of the seat was hard but it didn't create any issues. The food was served hot and was very delicious. Had a great flight experience with IndiGo.,0
2016,"Mumbai to Goa by IndiGo. Check-in was quite easy. We were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. Cleanliness had been maintained on this aircraft. The seats were very comfortable and the legroom was fantastic. The overall flight was very enjoyable, and I will have a pleasure flying with IndiGo again.",0
2016,Bangalore to Mumbai. Every time I travel with IndiGo I have no complaints with it. The cabin crew are polite and have a welcoming nature. Followed by the warm welcome was the smooth takeoff. The legroom was fantastic and the seats also wide enough. The food was hot and delicious. The landing was a smooth one and the overall experience is awesome.,0
2016,Flew from Mumbai to Bangalore with IndiGo. As we entered the aircraft we were warmly welcomed. Though we had to buy food but it didn't create any issues. The food tasted fantastic and seats were quite comfortable. The cabin crew was polite.  Overall flight experience was fantastic and I would keep travelling with them.,0
2016,Mumbai to Bangalore. IndiGo is the best domestic airline of India. The seats were very comfortable and the food was excellent. The cabin crew were polite and had a welcoming nature. The pilot kept us well-informed about the delays. The Takeoff and landing was a smooth one. I had an amazing experience with this airline and would keep on travelling with them.,0
2016,Jammu to Mumbai via Srinagar with IndiGo. It was a very pleasant flight and the cabin crew have a very welcoming nature. Cleanliness is well-maintained in all the aircrafts and the food tasted fantastic. The landing and takeoff are very smooth all the time. The restrooms do not smell like other airlines and the overall flight experience was amazing. I will definitely opt for it again.,0
2016,"Delhi to Bangalore return with IndiGo. Used the airline twice in the month. Very punctual and crews very attentive, which makes the service very pleasing. Expanded food menu is a good development. The seats are a let down though , as it is not comfortable for a six-footer like me and that when journey is almost 2.5 hours.",0
2016,Flew from Mumbai to Bhubaneswar with IndiGo. The flight arrived and departed on time. The interior is also well maintained and the seats are quite comfortable. The cabin crew are very polite and listens to one's problem very patiently. The landing was a smooth one and the pilot kept us well-informed about the delays. The food was delicious and it was a very enjoyable flight. I will have a pleasure flying with IndiGo again.,0
2016,"Delhi to Hyderabad with IndiGo. While I'm writing this, I'm waiting to make the payment for excess luggage. The problem is, it's been 40 minutes, and having been moved from one counter to another, three times, I'm still stuck in a state wondering if I'll ever get my boarding pass for an already delayed flight. I've travelled on pretty much every domestic airline that operates in India. This is my worst experience so far. Unlikely I'll ever buy a ticket with Indigo again.",1
2016,"Cochin to Delhi with IndiGo, flight was late by 1 hour due to incoming aircraft arriving late.  Seat was 13E(XL). Seats not that comfortable and cushioning is very hard. Had the instant noodles which was tasty along with Cappuccino which is always hot and tasty. Service was okay. At DEL, baggage took a long time to come.",1
2016,"Pune to Lucknow via New Delhi. I have flown every low cost airline in India and I find Indigo the best. Their booking is hassle free through app on both ios and android. Web check-in is a breeze, getting any optional services is also good. The check-in is curteous and to the point. Mind you they dont allow even 1kg extra on planes without payment, plus they have also started to screen weight of cabin bag just before boarding the flight. Its a business model because they are a budget airline. The planes are clean with courteous crew. The leg space of economy seats is ample. I am a heavy built person and I have never faced space crunch in the seats. The in-flight food is okay, nothing to write about. I never had to wait for my baggage for more than 10 min. Overall the flight experience has always been good.",0
2016,The overall flight experience from Delhi to Visakhapatnam via Hyderabad was good compare to other airlines.The seats were comfortable and spacious. The food was nice but there was no In Flight entertainment.I suggest Indigo to Have InFlight entertainment.,0
2016,Overall experience with Indigo flight from Delhi to Pune is good compared to others which I have travelled. Cabin space and seating arrangement is better than others. Overall ambience was pleasant. I think Indigo could enhance their service by adding some information devices inside the cabin showing a route map and if possible some outside coverage such as cameras. They could also offer Indian food during meal times rather than junk food.,0
2016,"Sometimes I seem to be repeating myself - travel from Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata 3-4 times yearly - but, once again, a flawless flight from IndiGo. Something I have written about in the past, the fact that the on board crew never has any Arrival Forms for foreigners, was finally rectified but, however, with an amusing twist: on my asking the cabin attendant for an Arrival Form, something that only non-Indian nationals need to fill, she very pertly asked me as to why I needed one since I look Indian. I replied that I was only 99.99% Indian, the remaining .01% being American as I carry that country's passport. (I did not mention that the Indian diaspora is the largest in the world. I was, however, tempted to do so.) P.S Food and beverages have to be purchased on IndiGo. I never comment on these as I usually carry aboard lots of munchies/snackies.",0
2016,Mumbai to Jaipur. I am a frequent flyer on this particular route. I prefer a low-cost flight on this route as the journey time is just 2 hrs. IndiGo is not a full-service carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an IndiGo flight be sure that you reach on time. They have a record of on time departures. The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good. The meals served are ready to cook meals and some snacks also available with good range of beverages.,0
2016,Yet another bad experience with Indigo from Udaipur to Mumbai. We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure. We were told that seats were all web checked in so we were forced to take paid seats or sit in different rows. Concept of unregulated extra charges within economy class is wrong. Moreover these are not declared at the time of booking tickets.,1
2016,"Pune to Nagpur with IndiGo. The plane was new, check in was smooth, boarding systematic, they are the only airline who use walkway to board the aircraft, this is better than using steps as PNQ airport does not use its airbridges for every flight. FA were smartly turned out and professional. The onboard trolley had snacks and beverages for purchase. The flights were punctual and comfortable.",0
2016,"Delhi to Goa, and I flew three times with IndiGo. The planes are new and clean, and staff very professional. Seats are large and comfortable. The pilots communicate well with the passengers. Flights were on time. They have shuttle buses which bring you to the plane. Check-in was fast and smooth, and you can bring along 2 check-in bags with no extra charge. I was very impressed as I was not sure what to expect.",0
2016,"Bangalore to Pune. A lack of organisational and communication skills and ticket counter staff had no idea how to handle awkward customers. I arrived at the airport with enough time to check in, the counter staff was dealing with a customer who missed her flight and this lasted over 15 minutes and meant that even though I was fast tracked to the front of queue I missed my flight - despite the flight not departing for another 40 minutes. I was told that I had to rebook a fresh flight at the cost of 17,500INR, which was then reduced to 3,600INR after I complained and explained the situation.",1
2016,"Flew Delhi to Mumbai and the first time I tried Indigo, via my travel broker. I have flown SpiceJet and Jet Airways and didn't really enjoy my experience with them, so I was keen to try another option. Pleasantly surprised on all fronts: customer service, flights were on-time and the inflight food was good. Seats were good sized as well, not as crammed as Spicejet. I would fly them again.",0
2016,"Flew various domestic flights with IndiGo through last year. All flights on time, never more than a ten minute delay, and they have a fairly comprehensive network.  Food was poor, choices often not available. Prices are no longer cheap. Staff is competent but not that courteous. They use bus boarding even at terminals where airbridges are empty which is irritating.",0
2015,"Bombay to Ahmedabad return I have long admired Indigo for it's focus on providing on-time service at a decent price with seats which are reasonably comfortable. I never minded paying the fee for better seats in the first row or exit row or for food which is against decent and I recommended it to many. However after a gap of over a year, I flew Indigo again and found the seats so thin, and the fares were not that decent compared to some carriers.",1
2015,"Port Blair to Delhi via Kolkata. The check in process required more time than expected. The staff was average. Seats were quite comfortable and aisle access was fair. Reliable airline and never been delayed. Food was available on request and is not included in the flight ticket. In flight entertainment was fair. I would recommend IndiGo for budget travellers, solo and family.",0
2015,"I have flown with IndiGo on several occasions domestically and this was my first international flight with them. Seamless check in with very polite ground staff. Cabin crew were polite, pleasant and efficient. The aircraft was clean, even the lavatories were kept fairly clean. Choice of food onboard to be purchased was decent. DXB-BOM had a long check in queue but the process however was efficient. Onboard service and aircraft cleanliness was up to the mark. Seats are pretty comfortable, as they're slimmer hence providing a better amount of leg space. Departures/arrivals on time.",0
2015,"Another flawless flight with IndiGo. Returned to Thailand ten days ago and flew from Pune to Bangkok with a plane change at Kolkata. (Layover time about 2 hours.) Smooth check-in (Pune and Cal), smooth boarding at both places, and very smooth and comfy flight with the always-friendly, efficient and helpful cabin crew. On time departure and arrival a few minutes early. I like the use of a ramp in Pune while getting on/off IndiGo planes. So much easier than steps/stairs. Clicked N/A on food and bev, these are available but I have never tried them.",0
2015,"Chennai to Singapore with IndiGo. Very nice seat, staff are very kind and smile faces. Pilots done very good job during lightning and turbulence inflight. Flight timings very perfect. Crew are very aware when passengers not wear seat belt during take off and alight.",0
2015,I am grateful to IndiGo for making my journey so comfortable and smooth. I traveled with IndiGo from Patna to Pune via Delhi. I had a pleasant flight experience and I'd like to commend staff on an exceptional level of service.  The staffs that we encountered were extremely polite.  Thanks to porters for being a great help and carrying my hand baggage. I'd like to mention staff who came with chocolates and biscuits and offered it to all kids as it was children's day! It was a very sweet gesture on part of IndiGo to come up with such ideas. Keep up the good work.,0
2015,"A superlative experience. Flew Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata with IndiGo. Waited at the baggage carousel (very short wait). Had checked in two items: a bag and a long cardboard tube containing prints. The former arrived at the carousel; the latter did not. Enquired from IndiGo staff attending at and they informed me that since the tube was marked 'fragile' it would arrive separately very shortly (which it did) and asked me if I was connecting to an IndiGo flight and on my answering, yes, I was, IndiGo said they will assign staff member to escort me and my luggage to domestic departures. A lady took charge of me and my luggage - she insisted on pushing my trolley, I insisted on doing it myself; I won - and took me all the way to IndiGo x-ray security. As I was carrying a bottle of duty-fee liquor in my carry on, and since liquor cannot be carried on domestic flights, I checked my back pack through x-ray and the IndiGo staff, to avoid bottle smashing, tied my backpack up very securely and put a fragile tag on it and asked the staff escorting me to inform IndiGo check in counter, where the pack was specially tagged and given to a baggage handler to carry it personally into the baggage room. A superb experience!",0
2015,"Overall, a very good flying experience with IndiGo. Flights on time. Boarding experience good. Airplanes clean inside, and cabin crew responsive to requests. Overall, a very well functioning LCC which meets my expectations.",0
2015,"Flew Indigo from BDQ to CCU via DEL. The IndiGo has some of the most courteous and helpful FAs. Despite the fact that my family didn't get seats together, FAs helped us swap seats with other passengers. FAs are also very kid-friendly. The meal service in IndiGo economy class is better than the meal service of every US-carrier on domestic routes. The food was absolutely delicious. During Delhi transit, we were asked to stay in our seats while the crew changed and cabin was cleaned for on-going flight to Kolkata. We were offered additional snacks while we were waiting inside the cabin. Our experience on DEL-CCU segment was also excellent. The only IndiGo process that I find to be strange is when they check your boarding pass as you disembark the aircraft.",0
2015,"Flew IndiGo for the 12th time (three visits to India with an aircraft change in Kolkata outward and inward) in the space of 12 months (Bkk-Kol-Pune-Kol-Bkk) and IndiGo does a very good job from start to finish. From checking in to the cabin crew to smiling pilots who say byebye when leaving the plane. The planes are clean, the seating is fine (I am 5'10"" and slim) as each flight is around 2-1/2 hours. Boarding is efficiently done, and every departure and arrival was on time. The fact that baggage takes time to arrive is probably beyond the airline's control.",0
2015,Morning Flight from Singapore to Chennai. Arrived at check in three hours early and had no checked in baggage so check in was smooth and quick. Boarding was also very quick and professional. Upon boarding I changed my seat from where I was sitting in the front to the seats just in front of the emergency seats near the wing as it was empty. I believe Indigo keeps these seats reserved as you can pay on board to upgrade these seats but no one bothered me for moving to these seats. Slept throughout the flight and overall flight was comfortable and very clean. No IFE or food but this was a short flight so not bothered at all about it would recommend in future.,0
2015,"Poor ground service, they asked me to check in my hand baggage for excess weight, which I understand is the rule. But when I was boarding the aircraft, I was amazed to find that loads of passengers had huge hand bags and in some cases multiple bags, which possibly were more than the weight limit. The ground staff told me that they check the weight again at the boarding gate to ensure that there is no overweight baggage, but I did not see any other bag being weighed other than mine!",1
2015,"I flew IndiGo from Kolkata to Delhi on 28th September 2015. Flight departed on time, it was good legroom and aircraft clean. The cabin crew were polite and efficient. Arrived on time at midnight. Overall, IndiGo is a reasonably good airline.",0
2015,"We took the Chennai-Bagdogra flight through Indigo. Booked well in advance under a deal and it is 100% worth every penny. From the ease of web check in to boarding, the IndiGo staff were very friendly. The journey was very comfortable, aircraft relatively new, flight stewardess were very friendly. Flight departure/arrival were on time. During the hop at Kolkata, we were even allowed to visit the cockpit and the captain demonstrated the functionalities. I never expected this kind of treatment, and we were very satisfied overall with Indigo. Even our return journey to Chennai was again with IndiGo, which again is very pleasing experience overall for us.",0
2015,"Mumbai to Jaipur via Delhi with Indigo. Check in at Mumbai for drop off (for web check in) is longer than the regular check in line. Efficient check in staff. These flights were all on time and the cabin crew efficient. Aircraft was clean, neat and well maintained. Still the best airline in India.",0
2015,"Quick check in, followed by efficient and punctual boarding. Buses in great condition. Newer aircrafts. Smiling and professional cabin crew. Captains update passengers regularly with clear announcements. Although it is a low cost carrier, a bit more cushioning on seats would be great. All in all, highly recommended, at least for Indian domestic sector.",0
2015,"Speedy check in. Boarding as typical in Pune airport. Not very organised, but still went well. Plane was very clean. Crisp and new feeling. Crew was smiling. My first experience on this airline, and will stick to it when travelling inside India. It is a low Cost but for Low Costs it ticks all the Boxes.",0
2015,We have taken the flight from Indore and we are regular flyers with Indigo. The seats were most uncomfortable. There was hardly any cushioning on the seat. Experience of seat was more or less similar to as if we were seating on wooden bench. You have already curtailed seat pitch and now the un-cushioned seats. You are requested to have some feeling for passengers minimum level of actual comfort also. Looking forward for better and more comfortable seats.,0
2015,"I recently took several flights with IndiGo and didn't experience any major issues. I checked other airlines before I booked and IndiGo were consistently cheaper, often by a wide margin. Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out. But these are minor quibbles, I would have no hesitation choosing IndiGo next time.",0
2015,6E 062. Service has deteriorated. On-time urgency once seen is no longer seen. Online seat booking charges for all aisle and window seats. You can only get middle seats for free. Too money minded.,1
2015,"6E189 6th June. Low budget Airline - their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. On time is a good thing - their flights are often now delayed or run late. Check-in process - everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. Two days back on 4th June I did Web Check in for my 6th June flight using my smartphone. While I was successful in doing web check-in in spite of me giving the email address and phone no I did not get a copy of the boarding pass - beating the while process of doing Web check-in. At Delhi T1 terminal when I tried to print my boarding pass at the Check in Kiosk while it displayed the Boarding Pass I did not get my print out! On taking it up with the ground staff I got a casual reply - please stand in the queue even though I mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. As a result I reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented ""Sir you are very late please be on time next time""! I have booked 3 tickets for my family through on-line booking system. After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking. But to my surprise and disappointment I found seats were allotted together that included an aisle and window seat along with the middle seat. When I tried to change the seats it did not allow me and charged me Rs 400 extra (Rs 200 each for Window and Aisle 'premium' seats) over and above the fare and there was no way I could change it.",1
2015,We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.,1
2015,Went from Delhi to Kochi because there is no such thing as a direct Delhi to Male (Maldives) flight and even with connections you have to mix and match airlines in order to get a halfway decent connection schedule. The airline is like the low budget carriers in Europe with people packed in like sardines. They don't have an inflight magazine that actually has anything to read or even a map with their air routes.,1
2015,DEL-PNQ(Pune)-DEL. December 2014. Worst possible time of the year to fly out of Delhi. Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,0
2015,Short haul from Delhi to Kathmandu. Clean on time friendly staff aircraft seemed new. Highly recommend Indigo for domestic flights in India or within Southeast Asia. Nothing special but low fares and definitely better service than Air India.,0
2015,4 March 2015 Flight 6E178. 6 March 2015 Flight 6E665. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi back and forth and it was great. The seats were comfortable (I took the first row seat with more leg space) the crew were very pleasant and we arrived on time. On the way back I arrived 3 hours earlier in Delhi and they were kind enough to let me go on the next flight so I didn't have to wait at the airport. Overall my experience with Indigo was 5 stars!,0
2015,Chennai to Delhi in economy. Pretty short flight so it's hard to complain. Comfortable seats good service and we left and arrived right on time. We were 2kg over (in 2 bags) but staff let it pass. Would fly Indigo again.,0
2015,Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.,1
2015,Jan 1-12 2015. Flight 6E 414 and 6E 461. BLR to Mumbai return. Being a senior citizen I had requested for travel assistance and was provided very promptly. The staff were very courteous and helpful. Here onwards I will prefer to fly Indigo Airlines and will recommend to others.,0
2015,Mumbai - Thiruvananthapuram 25 Dec 2014 Flight SG215. A very good option for domestic flights in India. All flights we took were on-time. Efficient check-in at airports. Seats weren't that comfortable but for short haul flights you can't complain.,0
2015,Delhi to Mumbai on Dec 31st. I had a good experience flying Indigo. We left on time plane was new and clean and service was good. Only comment is that FAs should smile a little more but besides that I was quite impressed by the service and would definitely use them again.,0
2015,MAA-BLR and BLR-BOM with a young family. Both flights were on time the aircraft were clean and the FAs very friendly and accommodating. Whilst we could not check in online with young children for some reason the check in staff ensured we were allotted the seats we requested. Staff were also flexible with us checking in most of our luggage (and exceeding the 15kg/person) instead of taking a carry on bag for each of the children making our lives easier. Bags were delivered even before we reached the belt in both cases. Streets ahead of Easyjet and Ryanair. The only domestic airline I ever book in India.,0
2014,6E 294 and 552 between BOM and BBI - Clean aircraft with decent leg space comfortable crew friendly and helpful good choice of food items for purchase on board. On time into BBI slightly delayed on return to BOM. Only negative was some luggage appeared on the belt very late at BOM due to a mix-up apparently. Overall up to the standards expected from Indigo.,0
2014,DEL-COK-DEL. Before time arrival on both the legs clean aircraft smiling hostess - what more can one ask for. By far India's best LCC.,0
2014,Flew from Poona to Calcutta and then a connection again IndiGo to Bangkok. Both flights virtually flawless. Have to always commend the cabin crew on their providing a comfortable flight. Noticed something new this time: on deplaning one of the cockpit staff emerges to join the cabin crew in bidding adieu. I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?,0
2014,Delhi to Kochi last Friday. Check in was efficient by friendly smartly dressed staff. My check in bag was over the 15kg limit. When I mentioned that my hand luggage was much lighter it was suggested I transfer between bags thus saving a hefty fee. Good clean aircraft but the pre-ordered meal was a disappointment. A packed fast food instant rice or noodle concoction possibly the type served to astronauts in deep space.,0
2014,Flew IndiGo November 11 to Kolkota from Bangkok. A full flight. On time takeoff very friendly and accommodating staff seats are ok cabin and toilets clean. Been flying IndiGo on and off the past few years and this has been my usual experience. Never tried the food but the cabin staff at least on this flight constantly asked - even though I never ordered any food - if I needed water each time the food cart went past.,0
2014,"Delhi (DEL) - Kolkata (CCU) 6 Nov 14 6E219 - Was traveling with a small trolley bag (15"" diagonally) and a compact laptop bag (15"" diagonally). Total weight 11 kgs. Got the shock of my life when they said that they wouldn't allow more than 7 Kgs in cabin including laptop. Now I had a laptop and charger. Then I had a SLR Camera with lenses plus a change of clothes and some files. They asked me to pack all the fragile items into one bag and check-in the other. Imagine my situation. There was no way I could fit all the fragile items into one bag and weigh in at less than 7 kgs. I checked-in the bag and nothing was damaged. On to other aspects of the flight. The seats are cramped and the seat back is very thin. You feel the knees of the guy behind you! The food they sell is mediocre. If you want on time performance then probably this LCC is the best in India. But if you want customer friendly service comfortable seats good food or in-flight entertainment (none exists on Indigo aircraft's) or for that matter a reasonable cabin baggage policy then do look elsewhere.",1
2014,Chennai to Bangalore. The flight took off from Chennai on time with the captain warning us beforehand that there was very heavy weather over Bangalore that he would try to avoid. We eventually got to Bangalore airspace and ended up circling for 20 minutes or more until the captain announced that the thunderstorm had passed and we could land before our fuel situation worsened. Reasonably comfortable seat and friendly crew possibly the most efficient LCC in the Indian skies at the moment and wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.,0
2014,Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.,1
2014,Flew from Goa - Delhi on 11 Aug 2014 Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant. The only negative point would be air hostesses being less interactive and involved.,0
2014,Flew from Delhi to Coimbatore and then from Chennai to Kolkata. This is an outstanding low-cost airline. I couldn't really find any fault with them! All staff were very friendly professional and helpful the planes were modern and spotless the captain gave informative and friendly announcements before during and after the flight the food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced; and the inflight magazine was well-produced. In Delhi we got stuck in a traffic jam caused by a sudden storm and so we only arrived at the aiport about 10 minutes before the flight. We assumed that we would miss the flight and have to make a plan B but the excellent and helpful staff quickly issued us boarding passes and rushed us to the plane so we still got away on time.,0
2014,I quite often travel from Pune to Nagpur and I would always prefer Indigo over other budget airlines. The ground staff and flight crew is humble and helpful and they give you good attention when needed. Flight crew seems well trained and organized compared to crew of other airlines. In-flight food options are good and inexpensive. They serve coffee unlike GoAir. Ticket pricing is better than competition.,0
2014,I flew with them from Bangalore to Pune recently. Ground staff at Bangalore airport were a bit disorganized but managed to get us on board fast. Seat was fairly ok but if you are a large person you will feel very uncomfortable as the armrests on this airline did not go up. After take off we were offered drinks despite Indigo being a budget airline. I felt a little hungry halfway through the flight and I manger to get a packet of chips for a cheap price. After which we landed in Pune fresh and nourished. Overall Indigo I feel has service that is better than any other budget airline that I knew.,0
2014,Flew Chennai Jaipur and return. Efficient service good value and organization from a cut price carrier. New clean aircraft friendly staff. Only problem was that out first booking had not actually been confirmed despite us having a booking number. I received nothing from Indigo to tell me this and I missed the small print on my booking. With an 30 minutes to spare a very helpful groundstaff person went to a lot of trouble to get us new bookings and got us the last seats on our flight. Brickbats for not providing better info re the not confirmed booking (we still don't know why) but kudos to the staff member who helped us in Chennai airport.,0
2014,Flew BOM to Goa return and BOM to Delhi. The Goa flights were rescheduled many times and we got constant updates by SMS many weeks in advance. Check in at Bombay was smooth with the web check in counter being empty. Flights on time and service was good.,0
2014,Flew MAA-AMD on Indigo 6e-237. Check in went smoothly the flight was on time it was clean and appeared new and had ample legroom. The food was delicious. The flight crew were quick and efficient. Overall good experience and no problems. Would fly Indigo again.,0
2014,Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,0
2014,Kept waiting for more then one hour in the plane to pick up some late comers. I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality. Never again.,1
2014,Last week I flew from BOM to Goa and return. Both flights were slightly delayed (ca 15 mins) but the quality of the service has compensated for these minor delays. The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals. In general comparing to European 'no frills' airlines IndiGo presents generally a better offering and service.,0
2014,Chennai - Mumbai and back. On time departure clean aircraft efficient cabin crew and on-time arrival. No wonder that they are the most preferred airline for domestic travel within India.,0
2014,I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs. Moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them.,1
2014,Flight 6E 284 from Chennai to Delhi on 6th Feb 2014. I took the morning flight at 8.20 am this meant that I did not have my breakfast before the flight. The flight duration to Delhi is 150 minutes. I wanted to have my breakfast on the flight I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least. They just walked past me and did not ask if wanted anything. They simply pushed the trolley past and went and sat down. I gave up and sat extremely hungry and frustrated.,1
2014,Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,0
2014,"MAA-DEL. It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",0
2014,I flew from Pune to Bangalore on 30th December 2013 on Flt 6E 407. I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo. This is the first time I've been on the receiving end of aloof treatment from Indigo staff.,1
2013,6E 427 BOM-MAA and 6E 278 MAA-BOM. Airplanes were clean boarded on time arrived on time (may be even a shade early) crew were friendly and helpful. Food items requested were available and tasty. Only negative is that service on board was slow leaving no time for inflight sales.,0
2013,Nov 4 2013. Route: HYD-BLR. I have been a frequent flyer on Indigo over the years and the airline has never failed to deliver. As noted by others here spotless aircraft helpful crew members and on-time service are what set it apart. I recommend the airline to all my friends visiting India from abroad. I'm flying Indigo's international service for the first time next year and am looking forward to the same level of service.,0
2013,Pune to Delhi. I had booked my meals under Corporate Plan. I was served food only 15 minutes before the flight was to Land i.e 1.5 hrs after the flight took off. The service started late and then the crew were serving/selling in each row going back to front rows serving water discussing menu options with those buying and chatting amongst themselves. On other airlines food is first served to those who pre-book. After selling to all they don't have many items left for serving. Suggest they keep the standard menu and serve pre booked passengers first.,1
2013,"DEL-TRV Nov 11. My first Indigo flight. As budget airlines go excellent! Actually strike ""budget""! You get what you pay for and you know what you're paying for and Indigo delivered to a T and with aplomb. New clean airy decor aircraft lovely FAs. And a lovely touch that others could copy: no jetway but instead of steps up they have a ramp so it's easy to get rollers up to the plane. Spent half an hour on the ground at Cochi during which the cabin was well-cleaned (lavatories included) and properly vacuumed. Compare that to Ryanair!",0
2013,I booked my tickets through Indigo to travel to my hometown in Kolkata during Diwali. I am impressed with the services provided by Indigo. A320's were clean and spotless with great sitting arrangements and ample leg space.,0
2013,Delhi-Bangkok-Delhi. New A320 aircraft's were clean. Since it is a budget airline they are very particular about checked in baggage and charge for every extra kilo. Even some passengers were nasty the flight attendants were friendly. I took my meal from airport so it was better and cheaper than on board. The flights were on time. I would fly IndiGo again!,0
2013,BLR-BOM return. On time departure arrival before scheduled time for both flights. Smooth check-in process and assignment of seats. Clean and spotless aircraft's legroom a bit limited though. Cabin crew very efficient and lot of smiles. Masala tea bought on board was tasty. Bus rides between gates and aircraft. On return leg we were transiting from SIN (different airline) and had excess baggage. They just checked the boarding passes for the international leg and did not charge anything extra as baggage fees!,0
2013,Flew from MAA to PNQ on 4th October. Check went on smooth. The flight was on time. The sandwich served onboard was excellent. Very clean and new aircraft. The flight arrived ahead of scheduled time. Overall wonderful experience. I would definitely fly with them again.,0
2013,If you are looking to enjoy a comfortable flight then look no further than Indigo. I am quite fussy about my travelling because of which I have completely put my faith in Indigo Airlines. I love the fact that the flights are punctual and the passengers are not made to wait. The flight attendants welcome you with a warm smile and make you feel comfortable. The flights are well maintained and the washrooms are also hygienic. The crew and the management have certainly done a wonderful job in keeping their patrons happy and satisfied. There was plenty of legroom available on-board even though my flight was full. If you are planning to travel with elderly people then do not worry. The staff are extremely friendly. This airline has always been my preference over others. I will strongly recommend their services.,0
2013,My job requires plenty of flying and I am a frequent user of Indigo. Everything is up to the mark the only thing that bothers me is the legroom I will say that it is really not comfortable. Flying again in November with Indigo.,0
2013,I flew from Pune to Chennai economy class 12.00 noon flight. Friendly staff but bad food and very poor leg space compared to other airlines. Clean toilets staff are helpful and friendly. Will definitely fly with Indigo again.,0
2013,DXB-DEL-DXB and was returning with my grandmother who was a wheelchair passenger. DXB-DEL the flight was half full and that allowed a lot of space to stretch out and sleep in comfort and while the outgoing service was excellent the return journey was par excellence. From the moment we arrived at T3 Delhi IGI our every need was met and every question answered with professionalism and friendliness. The ground handling staff member was very friendly and knowledgeable the check in staff at Delhi were very friendly and helpful and the crew of 6E21 provided service that cannot be faulted. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Indigo Airlines again.,0
2013,Afternoon departure from Chennai to Mumbai. Flight delayed but informed well in advance. Easy Check in. The aircraft was spotlessly clean. They managed to turnaround the aircraft in 20 minutes. Saw passengers disembarking from the previous flight at the same time when we were bussed to the aircraft which I thought was quite amazing. The cabin crew were very professional and took time to individually ask passengers on the feedback about the flight and quality of service. Will fly them again.,0
2013,Flew Indigo from Delhi to Bangalore and return. I have used Indigo several times over the years and the years and they have yet to disappoint me. I was particularly amazed at the great customer service and the cabin crew's happy attitude towards the customers. On-ground check in was fast and easy. Transfer from T3 (international terminal) at Delhi to the domestic terminal was a breeze this time around. Super clean planes. Will strongly recommend for travel for domestic flying in India.,0
2013,I flew from Delhi to Chennai. Good legroom space and good service by the cabin crew. The flight arrived early.,0
2013,Indigo from Mumbai to Goa and return. Flights were packed on both legs. We got emergency exit seats both ways as we asked for them. Great leg room and worth it for the 1 hour flight. Both flights on time. Service good. Planes are clean and they look new unlike many ageing Indian carriers. Value for money.,0
2013,I use Indigo regularly to fly BKK-DEL. Great airline with great fares! Easy to navigate website with no hidden costs. Never had any delays actual departure in many cases before the scheduled departure time. Extremely friendly and cheerful crew. Only complaint the rather expensive food and drink onboard and not accepting Indian currency on international flights.,0
2013,26 May 2013 Jaipur to Chennai. I saw some dirty used cups and wet tissues in the seat pocket in front of me. I highlighted this immediately to the cabin crew whilst boarding was going on. Told it would be cleaned in the next clearance and nothing could be done at that time. I was shocked and surprised with this answer. The cleaning was done in Ahmedabad by ground staff and then the flight took off for my destination Chennai. On time performance took higher importance over cleanliness and hygiene. The attitude of cabin crew was horrible. I will never fly Indigo again.,1
2013,"Goa to Bombay. Flight delayed an hour ""due to runway issues"" in Goa. Ground staff very helpful and accommodating and blocked out 2 adjacent seats for us at the front of the aircraft. Aircraft (A320) was clean crew were efficient although a little harried with the buy-on-board meal service given the short flight time. Good value for money and would fly them again.",0
2013,DEL-BLR-DEL. Both legs had a before time push back reached destination 10-15 mins early. Quick professional check-in. Had pre-ordered meals good value for money. Only problem with this airline is that you cannot just pre- book seats meals have to be booked with it otherwise highly recommended.,0
2013,Early morning departure from Chennai to Delhi. Boarding process completed before time and on time push back. Clean aircraft with an efficient cabin crew. Landed on time in Delhi. One of the best airlines to fly in India.,0
2013,New Delhi to Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi. Only Indigo has a direct flight in this sector at the time of writing. The flight experience was very good. Fare was cheap as booked early online selected the meal plus seating combination- Indigo Plus. Check-in and boarding was efficient flight departed and reached destination on time as per schedule. Though selected a standard seat on row 3the legroom was very comfortable. The aircraft was new and interior was clean. The only bad thing was the pre booked food booked online wasn't up to expected quality. Not sure whether its because we ordered vegetarian meal.,0
2013,Used Indigo BOM-TRV for the first time main reason was no other suitable alternative available. The aircraft was spotless looked brand new and the crew attentive and very polite. Legroom is very limited but I knew that before so I can't complain and for a 2 hour flight I could survive it. Tasty snacks were sold at reasonable prices on board. Flight was on time.,0
2013,I flew with Indigo in August 2012. Given the hype about this airline I thought of giving them a try and they didn't disappoint. Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge. However there isn't much space between the seats and does feel a little cramped.,0
2013,MAA-TRV and TRV-BOM. Easy to use website for online booking and immediate text confirmation to my mobile. Fast courteous check in . New aircraft comfortable seats and departures ahead of schedule. FAs were all smart friendly and attentive. Great fare and an extra 600 rupees (about 7.50) got me a reserved extra legroom seat food and drink. Food was fresh excellent quality and well presented. Everything about this airline was slick and professional with an element of fun. A great experience and highly recommended.,0
2013,Morning Departure from Mumbai. There was a snaking queue at check -in but the staff were very prompt and I got my boarding pass in 10 mins. Clean aircraft and push back 5 mins ahead of schedule. Landed in Chennai 15 minutes ahead of scheduled time. Good value for money.,0
2013,I was supposed to fly from Delhi to Mumbai this morning (10.25am) on Indigo but Delhi airport was heavily fogged out and the runway operations had been shut for a few hours. I was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal. Upon arrival I was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and Indigo were unsure when departures would take place. They immediately asked me if I would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening I declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties. The whole affair was so well handled I was most impressed by Indigo's ground staff. This is one rare gem in the Indian aviation scene.,0
2013,For the first time my husband and I travelled with Indigo airlines 2 days ago and were very sceptical as it was a budget airline and we had slightly excess baggage. To our surprise from our very first contact with the Indigo airline staff to the end of our trip we were impressed. The lovely young lady at Mumbai airport greeted us with pleasantries checked in our luggage which was a bit above the limit. Once on board on our flight to Singapore we found the seats spacious and comfortable the crew courteous and professional. The inflight service was excellent and reasonably priced. We purchased some spiced chai and cookies that came beautifully packaged in a tin. Regular announcements by the crew were clear and polite. Would gladly travel Indigo Airlines again and highly recommend it.,0
2013,Flew MAA-PNQ (Chennai-Pune). Excellent crew and food service. Seats were terrible and the plane was unclean. One thing I respect about IndiGo is their promptness. The problem with that was that as soon as all passengers had disembarked the next group boarded. Nevertheless the best domestic duty-free I've ever seen.,0
2012,I travelled from Bangalore to Jaipur. The leg space between seats was the length of my iPad. If the seat in front is reclined it would hit you face. Very uncomfortable amongst the low cost carriers. Looks like the airline is interested in making money by cramming more seats.,1
2012,BOM-DEL-BOM. Early morning departure from Bombay was on time and a good flight. Very full both ways. Good check in services and very courteous staff. Good airline to fly domestic.,0
2012,Flew Kolkata-Bangalore via Chennai. Flight departed on time the aircraft despite being one of their older ones was clean and well-maintained. The crew were simply superb. Though the catering onboard should improve. The variety is very restricted. We made an early arrival at Bangalore despite a late arrival in Chennai. Will fly them again.,0
2012,"COK-BOM. Check in at Cochin a breeze no queue at all. A320 was clean and modern. The flight attendants were active and friendly. on and arrived on time. In Mumbai the bags were out in ten minutes. Indigo made flying fun from Cabin Crew with their Leading Lady and Miss Indigo badges the aircraft steps had painted on the side ""Here comes the hot stepper"". The sandwiches to purchase in a box that said ""airwich"" even the cashew nuts came in a collectable tin which said ""Nut Case"" on it.",0
2012,BOM-BDQ on A320. Check-in was not as efficient as I have know Indigo to have. But it was not a problem. We were kept waiting for take-off due to congestion but flight itself was pretty standard efficient Indigo. The chief FA seemed rushed while making announcements.,0
2012,Ahmedabad to Pune on Indigo. Check in was easy fast and efficient. Clean plane with good service and a very friendly crew. On time and value for money.,0
2012,DEL-COK-DEL. Excellent flight both flights on time as we had pre-booked meals and seats check-in was a breeze. Overall highly recommended as a premium low cost carrier.,0
2012,DEL-COK-DEL. Excellent flight both flights on time as we had pre-booked meals and seats check-in was a breeze. Overall highly recommended as a premium low cost carrier.,0
2012,Overall a good experience from HYD-BLR-HYD and HYD-DEL. Planes are new and modern crew all young pleasant and helpful and speak perfect English. Seating is very tight - the person in from of me reclined their seat and it was in my face. They sell food which is tasty and well priced. One major negative as at check in at HYD. My company bought my ticket in the US and they asked me to produce the credit card. As I could not they denied me boarding until I bought another ticket which was very frustrating and almost caused me to miss the flight. They gave me an email print out for a refund but this is certainly not up to international standards.,0
2012,Goa to Mumbai on Sunday 5-8-2012. On time and welcomed by smiling crew. The plane was spotless and new. The food was reasonably priced and good. Short flight of 55 minutes. At the end the Pilot came out of the cabin to say goodbye to everybody.,0
2012,Dehli-Kathmandu-Dehli. Unfriendly staff they ask you to be at the airport 4 hours before departure for international flights and 2 hours for domestic flights. Arrived 3.5 hours early as anticipated no check-in counter was open. Nevertheless the plane seemed to be quite new and comfortable.,1
2012,"MAA-HYD. The crews are friendly the airplanes clean they still run a largely on-time operation and prices remain very affordable. The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment. Even worse if you have to make a change to your reservation the ""convenience fee"" is charged every time you make a change. IndiGo is unfortunately picking up the bad habits of the Spirits and Ryanairs of the world though at least the service is very good for now anyway.",0
2012,Bangkok-Delhi. Plane was new though no inflight entertainment which most of them have. No food or beverage unless you buy. For a flight of 4.30 hours strange thing. A cup of premixed tea cost 100 THB (INR 170.00).,1
2012,Bangalore to Delhi return. Ground staff and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. The planes used also were new clean and comfortable. The food too was pretty good. However it is better that they sell at least a water bottle. Although they do sell water they provide it in paper cups and every time I had to pay Rs 40.,0
2012,BOM-LKO. Flew on Indigo thrice and all 3 flights were delayed. Paid extra to book seat of choice and meal. Check-in staff extremely rude and unfriendly. Cabin was not as clean as they rave about. Inflight cabin service without a smile. Only cold meals served. They also charge for wheelchairs with fares comparable to full service carriers. Not my choice and not recommended. Very pricey for a 'low cost airline'.,1
2012,SIN-DEL The flight was awful. I asked for an exit row seat and got the seat in front of exit row which did not recline. Had to sit upright for 6 hours. Babies hollering and crying everywhere. No food or drink unless you buy - they should at least serve a sandwich on an international flight - what does it cost? 50 cents?,1

2012,Flew from Mumbai to Chennai on February 23rd 2012. Enjoyed the experience and was impressed with the service and the inflight magazine.,0
2012,BKK-BOM-BKK. Friendly crew. Check-in both in BKK and BOM easy. Food onboard was very expensive compared to Air Asia. I always carry snacks. Water free. Plane 2/3 full. Everything was so hassle-free that I have already booked two more flights on this route for May and October at the same price.,0
2012,Kolkata-Chennai-Pune leg. The airline offers a very good product with excellent staff to go with it. The aircraft is well-maintained and the staff know what they are offering. They are a low-cost carrier however they don't cut corners on security and service.,0
2012,"Airline staff at Ahmedabad were unprofessional and non-committal. Flight to Bangalore from Ahmedabad scheduled at 5 pm was delayed more than 3 hours and the behaviour of ground staff was irresponsible. As the expected time neared and no trace of the aircraft was seen the answer I got from ground staff was ""we don't know"". Arrival at Bangalore airport was chaotic. It took ground staff more than 40 minutes to put the baggage on the carrousel. Passengers arriving on other airlines were exiting the terminal before our baggage was even on the carrousel. Indigo was my preferred airline until my previous trip - a very steep deterioration in quality.",1
2012,BBI-DEL. Flight slightly delayed due to late departure at Delhi. Seated next to the exit no recline for the seat and the other passenger behind! Aircraft was clean although some parts broken. There were huge selections of snacks and beverages. Although the water comes in such a tiny glass you have to pay for it. Cabin Crew friendly and with a natural smile. Overall this airline is professional.,0
2012,BOM-DEL-BOM. Boarding was swift and passengers greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight left on time and the service friendly with enough information was given by FA's. The flight on second leg was one hour late and IndiGo did manage to reach out passengers by sending SMS. Again friendly crew and clear information from FA's. The only downside is the food could be tastier. The food sold inflight has absolute no value of money and leg space is poor for an 188 cm man. I had to fit in and sit in slanting positing.,0
2011,DEL-BKK on newly introduced international service by Indigo. Clean aircraft everything BOB on time and professional crew. Not very different from domestic services the only difference that food is priced in USD. The highlight was great value fare booked well in advance.,0
2011,Did BOM-MAA once and doing my second today. Great crew. Very helpful at check-in. Courteous onboard and new aircraft's. Only hitch is food. While ticket rates are on par with Jet and AI particularly after KF problems one has to buy food and that too from a limited choice. Pre-booking is there but the website does not guide as to how.,0
2011,Kolkata to Hyderabad. Check-in staff pleasant. Cabin crew professional and courteous. Aircraft clean but seats very tight. For a 2-hour flight the low price was more important than seat comfort.,0
2011,Mumbai-Bangalore. Flight on time great service from airport check-in to end stage. Well planned and executed model for passenger satisfaction. Taken to the aircraft by bus this afternoon flight was full yet the flight attendants were calm and courteous. They worked seamlessly with an almost natural smile. Aircraft clean. Onboard options for food were plenty though slightly pricey.,0
2011,BLR-DEL return trip. Had a good experience yet again. The flights took had a timely pushback. Onward journey a bit delayed due to bad weather at BLR and the pilot had to change the takeoff runaway direction. Crew courteous and got my pre booked food. Return journey was uneventful as well. Will surely continue flying Indigo.,0
2011,Bombay-Jaipur return Pune-Nagpur. Easy check in and nice friendly staff in Bombay. On the return (Jaipur to Bombay) we were asked to carry no hand baggage onboard as it was a high security day. The airline could have informed us earlier as had breakable stuff in my hand baggage and they forced me to check it in. Pune to Nagpur efficient and competent crew.,0
2011,Connection at Madras to Hyderabad (coming from US) and back to Madras connecting to US. Both trips an hour long each. Ground Staff helpful at both ends cabin crew charming and helpful. A320 clean and comfortable ample room in overhead bins. Remembering yester-years of Indian Airlines service attitude it is amazing what the open market brought to traveling Indian public.,0
2011,Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in DEL-BOM. An efficient airline which prides itself at being on time with helpful air and ground crews. New clean aircraft - just one grouse though a low cost carrier it would be great if the leg space was better. I am about 6 feet tall and it becomes uncomfortable in case of flights which are over an hour or so.,0
2010,Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in friendly and polite cabin crew and new air planes.,0
2010,MUM-DEL. Excellent service - paid Rs300 for the front row which if you're my size is worth it! Inflight food is on a pay basis nothing special but it's good size portions and not bonkers expensive. Great inflight crew cheerful and engaging brand new planes. My first choice now for domestic Indian flights.,0
2010,DEL-CCU-DEL NAG-DEL a few times and happy to take IndiGo. The seat pitch makes me feel a little cramped at times but otherwise is excellent. The crew is courteous and always ready to help.,0
2010,Pune to Nagpur return. Smooth efficient check in. Flight 80 minutes with breakfast you can buy onboard. Due to turbulence the cart never got to where we were. Staff very pleasant. Return trip late evening flight. Delayed by 45 mins but managed to do a quick turn around and got us to Pune on time.,0
2010,Bangalore to Mumbai good quality from this budget airline. Flight on time leg room good and boarding a breeze. I will use IndiGo Airlines as it is value for money.,0
2010,Kolkata to Guwahati and Kolkata to Bangalore. Check-in okay not too friendly. Aircraft were new so cabins kept clean. Seats okay. Cabin crew better than ground crew. Cheap tickets. The only complaint is that the food is expensive - INR 150 for chicken sandwich is too much considering it's just a 2 piece sandwich which you can get for INR 50 at super-markets. The great thing about IndiGo is the on-time performance.,0
2010,Kolkata-Jaipur route on time clean aircraft and nice crew. One bad thing about this airline is that they do not even serve water at free. Snacks were expensive outside foods are allowed.,0
2010,DEL-CCU-DEL. Full flight outbound but seated in front row which was good. No queues at checkin nice crew cheerful and professional. Flight left on time and landed early - baggage was off within a few minutes wait. Coming back slightly less good check in experience - at airport several hours early after arriving in international - wouldn't let us check in until 2 hours before departure. When asked for front row seats were told we'd have to pay - got it free on outbound guess I was lucky! Flight crew again cheerful and attentive. Flight was early again bags took about 20 mins but that's par for the course in Delhi. Inflight food not paid and ok value for money.,0
2010,BDQ-HYD via BOM. The check-in at Vadodara was smooth though they did not give me through check in to Hyderabad. I had to claim my luggage and re-check in at Mumbai but it was smooth. Ground staff courteous and efficient. Aircraft clean cabin crew efficient and courteous. Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic. Overall not bad at all.,0
2010,BLR-BOM on the early morning flight. Cabin was clean. FAs attentive and courteous. We had pre-booked snacks and served a good Veg Sandwich and juice. Quite good. Other choices too were available.,0
2009,DEL-PNQ. Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant. The only negative point would be air hostesses being less interactive and involved.,0
2016,"I flew on the 787 from SYD-HNL-SYD. The flight out of Sydney was about 2 hours late due to arriving late into Sydney. We purchased tickets during the Jetstar sale and once adding all the bells and whistles on top the ticket was still very reasonably priced. A tip is if you prebook seating to book in the front section of the economy cabin (mini cabin) because there's only 4 rows of economy here. Front row next to the window because no one reclines into you. The seats are fairly narrow at 9 abreast. Food was edible both ways, drinks were fine and if you wanted more you could purchase it. Excess luggage was reasonable and fortunately available to purchase. Inflight entertainment had plenty of options to keep someone entertained during the flight as well. Plus a usb port to charge devices as well which was ideal for phone/tablet. Crew were visible but didn't go to any extreme lengths to do anything above and beyond their limits.",0
2016,"Launceston to Sydney. Jetstar have removed Check-In kiosks from Launceston Airport, meaning everyone that has checked in baggage and/or hasn't checked in online must do so at the counter. That I was okay with, however, what I found somewhat appalling was the nearly 45 minute wait to be checked in, as Jetstar have cut down staffing levels to just three team members checking in my flight and another flight to Melbourne (some 300 people in total), which left me with little time to enjoy the sights of this small but wonderful airport. Boarding was efficient, and I was also allocated an exit row seat upon my check-in. However, the crew were very robotic, and even though this was only a flight of some 90 minutes to Sydney, just did not seem to be interested or attentive. With the exception of the in-flight magazine, there was no entertainment available, and the rather limited in-flight menu made me regret not purchasing something at the airport (Vietnamese ""Pho"" was little more than a cup-a-soup with bits of meat in it). Overall, Jetstar just doesn't seem to be as good a carrier as it was just a few years ago, and when compared to recent flight experiences on Tiger Airways, doesn't seem to provide that memorable flight experience, especially where service, catering and crew are concerned. However, I would probably still continue to fly Jetstar if there was a very attractive deal (I only paid $115 for the starter plus fare to Sydney), or if they were the sole carrier offering a direct route to a destination.",0
2016,"Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I was travelling in New Zealand and I received an email from Jetstar informing me that my flight on 4th December to Kuala Lumpur had been cancelled. There was no back-up plan nor any other flight options made available except to call the customer service team. The next available flight was the following day  the 5th (the original date I booked) and which we were told that we could confirm our presence 3 hours prior to the departure time. We called back 12 hours later and we were told that nothing could be done because the flight is now full. We needed to wait for 2 more days for the next available flight. When we asked if we could book other tickets back to Kuala Lumpur with the cost fully reimbursed the customer service answered that this is subject to the approval from the claims department. It is obvious that booking flights at such a last minute will be extremely costly, which defeats the purpose of purchasing the cheap fares from Jetstar months in advance. So no flight, no other options, except to accept the refund of the money paid or wait for the next flight out. To add on, the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful. Upon checking-in in New Zealand for our flights back to Melbourne, we spoke to the customer service at the airport. In less than 15 minutes, they confirmed 2 seats for us for the 5th December which was what we have been told that the flight was full. Fast forward to the day of the flight (2 days later)  once again another frustrating e-mail which stated a delay in the flight from 1200 hour to 1350 hour. Bearing in mind that we have a transit at the Singapore airport, the email stated arrival time to be 1840 hour whilst the departure from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was at 1945 hours. However on the plane, the captain announced that the ETA was at 1930. Logically speaking, we expected that the Jetstar crew would have had the information for passengers who are transiting in Singapore for the KL flight. Hence, they would have been aware that the Melbourne flight was delayed thus wait for these us to arrive. On our way there we even heard them calling out name, so I immediately stop by the information counter to request for them to hold the gate as our flights were delayed. The gate was closed when we arrived. We explained ourselves, but once again nothing could be done despite already having our boarding pass in hand. They even checked our seat numbers but still the same answer. At the transfer counter, I was told by the airport staff that the flight we had just missed was the last flight out. And to top it all, the representative only showed up after close to 2 hours later. No apologies, nothing. It was as if nothing had happened and we should be thankful for the arrangements made. When it was our turn, he quickly briefed us on the flight to be taken then next day and the accommodation provided for the night. I asked if we had any other options and all he answered was no because that was the last flight and that is all they can do. I even asked if we could book any other available flight and get Jetstar to reimburse the full cost. The answer is yes, but the next available flight was at 2145 hour when it was already 2120 hour.",1
2016,"Our holiday package to Hawaii and return flying Sydney to Honolulu included Jetstar, which made us hesitate, but the chance to fly on the new 787 won us over. This flight was the pits! The check-in system crashed as we were checking in, so the whole airport experience was slower than usual. On boarding the plane and seeing the seats for the first time, we were stunned - 17"" width and 30"" pitch of the cattle class seats would be good for our 9 year old grandson, but these are not fit for any adult. I am not the smallest of 64 year old males, nor am I the biggest, but my shoulders would not fit giving me no wriggle room. We paid extra for an exit row, thank heavens for that, so we had plenty of leg room. The 3-3-3 configuration is far too tight for any sort of comfort. The aircraft is actually very noisy compared to others we have flown on, so you need a good set of noise-cancelling headphones. We also paid for the food package, which was not worth it - lousy food (we are still trying to identify the meat). The hotdog for breakfast (!) on the return flight was unexpected and we had to wait ages to have the rubbish collected. The staff are not a happy bunch of vegemites, rarely smiling, and rarely seen as they all managed to go to the back of the plane and have a sleep - something which we could not achieve. Never again will we fly Jetstar.",1
2016,Shame that Jetstar have shifted too far towards money making rather than customer service. I find most elements efficient. The planes are usually modern and well maintained inside. Cabin crew are fine. They used to be my first port of call and I've flown return to Sydney 7 times in the last six months but will look elsewhere now. While they haven't don't anything wrong we turned up for a flight early due to a meeting finishing sooner than expected. We asked if there was a chance of avoiding a five hour wait by shifting to an earlier flight if they had availability. Handily a flight was leaving in 35 minutes with plenty of space. Would they move us? Yes for $300 more. Seeing as our ticket only cost $400 for a return that didn't seem good value. We pointed out that if they shifted us onto a flight leaving in 30 minutes with no chance of selling that space they would then have 4-5 hours to sell our seats on to someone else. No chance. Against company policy. Both customer service agent and check in agent told us the same thing. Both very helpful and both said it's a silly rule. Virgin on the other hand have no problems moving something forward.,1
2016,I am appalled at Jetstar for not providing me suitable accomodation or an alternative flight. I was flying back home to Sydney from Melbourne. They cancelled my flight due to weather but gave me no more than two hours notice and offered no other options for alternative flights either with themselves or another airline. The staff were very unhelpful. I recommend anyone to pay slightly more for a better airline.,1
2016,Brisbane to Denpasar. First time flying Jetstar internationally and first time on the Boeing 787. Have flown Jetstar within Australia for a pleasant experience and found the crew friendly and obliging. Did not enjoy flying Jetstar internationally. The difference in service and seating between the two is like chalk and cheese. I am 186cm and booked the exit row with seat 23C. Cost was $45 for the exit row which in my view is very acceptable. Plenty of leg room but seat is narrow with hardly any padding. Seat was very uncomfortable. Booked the bundle which included a meal which was a cold chicken type rice salad. Worst meal I have had on an airline. Crew were not friendly and appeared disinterested. Once they gave the meals out (which was early in the flight) hardly saw them again. For a six hour flight would have been happy to pay for a bottle of water but you do not see them to do so. Loved Bali and can not wait to go back but not with Jetstar!,1
2016,Jetstar Airways offered by far the best rate on this route so I decided to fly with them from Wellington to Christchurch. They succeeded to make the trip in under 40 minutes which is impressive. The ground staff were very friendly and did make everything for the passengers to board as quick as possible and the same happened at disembarking. I would say very efficient. Seat comfort was like with any other low-cost airline so nothing special here. I would recommend them and fly with them again on a short distance.,0
2016,Queenstown to Auckland with Jetstar. JQ send text message about time to web-check and about flight delay 8 hours in advance with no cost. Ground staff very nice. Dedicated queue line boarding for QF FFP member. A very full evening flight but inside the cabin is slightly hot due to sunny weather outside the windows. Lots of airline marketing advertisement audio played during the flight but the highlight is the scenery of Queenstown which is beautiful during takeoff.,0
2016,"My wife and I were booked on Qantas from Ayres Rock to Melbourne via Alice Springs. I checked in on line the night before and all was fine, in the morning we received an email saying we had been moved to Jetstar. When we went to the airport it appeared the QantasLink connection to Alice was not operating. The ground staff did a very good job moving the people connecting through Alice. We were given exit row seats on the plane and A$15 airport caf voucher because of the later departure. I have no problem with Jetstar as such, my gripe is that we paid for a flight with snacks and drinks and never even got water on Jetstar. I think if the airline move you then they should give the same service you paid for. If we had wanted Jetstar we would have booked them. The flight and crew were fine.",0
2016,"Flew from Singapore to Bali, JQ117. My flight departed with slight delay and arrived around 15-20 minutes ahead of time. Jetstar's Ground Service and Crew were kind, friendly and efficient. The ticket was quite expensive for early morning flight but I have no option since I need to go to another destinations from Bali. The seat was comfortable enough for standard low cost carrier. Overall, it was a pleasant flight.",0
2016,"Auckland to Christchurch with Jetstar. Using kiosk to obtain a boarding pass and went direct to gate after security check. Early morning flight extremely full, cabin crew professional but not so friendly. A surprise is that the captain greeted each passenger when we disembarked.",0
2016,"I checked into my Jetstar Airways flight from Sydney to Perth and went to the gate to find that that there are no powerpoints anywhere.  We boarded our flight and found ous seats were quite crammed. The flight was quite pleasant except the disappointment of a $5 voucher which could only buy a chocolate, nuts or a drink. The staff on the flight were very nice and friendly. On landing it was 11PM and we froze as the walk from the aircraft is outside.",0
2016,"Flew Melbourne to Tokyo Narita, returning to Melbourne via Cairns, my first time on the 787 and it was brilliant. This aircraft is spacious and user friendly and the first time I did not experience any discomfort with my ears. The seats were comfortable. The crew on the outbound flight were distant and disinterested whilst the crew on the journey to Cairns were friendly, hard-working and engaging. The meals were also quite good and adequate for the durations of the flights. We flew via Cairns on the journey home, transferring to a domestic flight to Melbourne on the A321, which also isn't a bad aircraft. The pilots up the front did an excellent job considering the strong winds in Melbourne. Well done, I was impressed.",0
2016,Sydney to Cairns. Terrible experience at check-in. My husband and I traveled to Australia with his parlor guitar as he played at a wedding here. The airline would not let him carry on his 3/4 scale parlor guitar. Insisting it wouldnt fit in the plane and there was no way to even hand-check it as we boarded. This guitar has traveled all over the world in cabins without issue on much smaller planes. When we boarded the overhead bins were huge! Generous fit in even the smaller bins. The airline lied to us and lacked any sense of good judgement or customer service. We paid over a hundred dollars to store the guitar at the airport. Jetstar - today you earned passionate detractors. What a terrible experience for a working musician and tourist in your fine country. Virgin assured us they would have allowed it in their cabin. Last trip with Jetstar Airways. Badly done all around.,1
2016,"Firstly, this was my first time trying Jetstar after years of being a loyal flyer on Air New Zealand. I would outright recommend Jetstar to anyone, even though their service isn't as comprehensive or fulfilling, they are a pleasure to fly on. My flight left early by about 5 mins. We were kept informed throughout the flight of progress. My seat was great (1F), and if you can, choose this seat or any others in row 1. For the price of this flight they are miles ahead of Air New Zealand. Will fly again.",0
2016,"Three months out we purchased and paid for return tickets Melbourne to Bangkok. I added the business max package as this was our holiday of a lifetime through Europe and my wife had 5yrs earlier donated a kidney to me. I wanted this to be a special experience. 4 weeks out the return arrangements were changed from a direct flight to coming via Singapore with a different code flight. A little inconvenient but not being seasoned travelers didn't worry. At 5pm the day before departure Jetstar emailed that the outbound flight was cancelled. Their call center organized seats on a Qantas domestic to Sydney and connected to Qantas to Bangkok. The call center were deceptive in not disclosing there were no business class seats available on either leg. When asked the seat numbers we were told these would be allocated at the airport. At the terminal when all was disclosed Jetstar after 12minutes wait advised to see the Jetstar staff at the terminal. Our Qantas flight was due to leave at 6.30am, Jetstar staff don't start work till 7am. This flight was our only option to make our connection in Bangkok. After our holiday and 2 days before Bangkok we found our seating allocated Bangkok to Singapore as 1A & 1B. We boarded Jetstar Asia to find their is no business class and apparently you order meals in advance on their web site but non of this was ever advised and so no meals were provided. A coffee was $4. The embarrassment of having your meal tray down and being bypassed was incredibly stressing. The last leg Singapore to Melbourne was business class. Some compensation was negotiated but not to cover the hurt, embarrassment and disgusting treatment at the hands of this airline.",1
2016,"Bought a flight last minute from Brisbane to Cairns. Advertised price was $120. After navigating the incredibly sneaky website, and paying the fee for 20kg of baggage, I managed to get away paying $150. Little did I know that Gold Coast airport, which is over 100km away from Brisbane airport, can be used interchangeably. So it wasn't until I arrived at Brisbane that I realized my mistake. Thankfully the kind staff at Jetstar did me the favour of allowing me to pay a $50 fee and catch the next flight out of Gold Coast, provided I could make the flight. Please Jetstar, you shouldn't have. Upon arriving at Gold Coast, I promptly paid the $50 fee and queued for the baggage drop. The agent at the baggage drop informed me that I was over the allowable limit for my checked baggage. Being familiar with airport procedures, I said ""Ok, just let me put the excess into my carry-on."" He replied by asking me to put my carry-on as well as my laptop (?) on the scale. He then informed me that I was 16kg overweight. I reluctantly agreed to pay for it, until he informed me that it would cost me $240 additional. So if I were to have taken that offer, I would have paid almost 4X the advertised price at a whopping $440. Thanks Jetstar! I went back to the help desk and there was a lot of hand wringing. And they had the gall to tell me they were doing me a favour by bending the rules by letting me pay the $50.  I've flown with a lot of bad airlines, all over the world, but your extortion game gives me a real appreciation for how good I've had it before.",1
2016,"Melbourne to Denpasar. Jetstar's ground service is the same compared to full-service airlines in Business Class. Dedicated check-in area in Melbourne, fast track through security and immigration and Priority Boarding. Since, I am a Qantas Platinum I had access to the First Class Lounge. Excellent lounge, by the way. Once we were onboard we were offered 3 options for departure drinks including Champagne, orange juice or water. Inflight service offered drinks with nuts, followed by starter and main course. Dessert and cheese offered from a trolley with alcohol, tea and coffee. Since the flight was only 5 hours only one meal service was offered. Throughout the rest of the flight the crew were proactive offering a snack bar. We arrived in Bali 5 hours late, because of technical issues in Melbourne. We were notified on this 4 days prior to the flight which was good. The downside was the speed of the baggage to come out at Denpasar Airport. Business class bags surprisingly came out last. Jetstar should seriously consider Priority baggage for their Business Class passengers. Overall a good, comfortable flight.",0
2016,"Denpasar to Cairns. Not flown yet and most unhappy. Now on second electronic scheduled departure time change, no problem. On original booking I paid for extra legroom seats. Confirmation of acceptance of new flight time requires confirmation of original seat selection. Final stage demands another payment of the seat reservation fee before acceptance. I am not aware of any European airline that resorts to this rip off practice. Jetstar has no system of communication with a human, only ask Jess, which gives a load of useless questions and answers. Sept 2016 flight date is a dummy to tick the boxes, booking for Dec 2016.",1
2016,"This flight from Melbourne to Townsville was booked on Qantas points but, despite having the Jetstar reservation code, it wasn't possible to check in online. At Melbourne Airport check-in and bag drop using the kiosks at Terminal 4 was very quick. The terminal itself is quite pleasant, but there was a very long walk to the gate (some elderly passengers complained to the crew about this). We had seats 1A and 1B at the front by the aircraft exit, and as there was no bulkhead we had a huge amount of legroom. The crew were efficient and friendly, and the snack we purchased on board was fine. The flight left 15 minutes late but arrived on time. Overall quite a pleasant experience.",0
2016,"Newcastle to Cairns via Brisbane. Can you believe that checked in baggage had to be claimed in Brisbane? Then, what to do with a suitcase for 5 hours? Ground crew told me that at their discretion I may be able to go through the screening team, and pointed to stairs. This however was not the case, so I lugged the case back down the stairs. If there is so much trouble with a domestic flight, it will be a dark day before I venture on an International flight, or another domestic flight. This did not happen on the outward flight but that was with another airline.",1
2016,"Sydney to Honolulu with Jetstar. The flight was cancelled without notice. I flew all the way to Sydney from Perth early in the morning. When I got off the plane, first thing I saw on the screen was that the flight was cancelled. I wasn't even notified and no suggestions from Jetstar besides stay in Sydney for another 2 days to get the earliest possible Jetstar aircraft to Honolulu. I ended up booking another flight to Honolulu after getting to Brisbane at my own cost. I will never use this airline again.",1
2016,Jetstar flight from Singapore to Melbourne cancelled at short notice without reason. Rebooked us on a delayed flight to Brisbane. No information at all from the airline upon arrival at Singapore. We were left to fend for ourselves - a family with small children. Flying to Brisbane but still unclear how we will get to Melbourne. Avoid at any cost.,1
2016,Early morning service from Christchurch - Wellington with Jetstar Airways. Check in fast but the check in staff were not the most welcoming. Boarded on time. Crew were great and friendly. Departed on time. Ticket price included a $10 voucher for which I got a hot beverage and a snack served by were friendly crew. Landing into WLG was very choppy and turbulent. However the flight deck crew did a good job. Arrived into WLG a few minutes early. Bags took a whilst to arrive at WLG. Overall a very reasonable flight that exceeded expectations.,0
2016,"The Jetstar Airways flight from Perth to Gold Coast was delayed by twenty minutes due to late inbound arrival of aircraft but that was no concern. The pilot did say that we would be landing on the dot, early if Gold Coast airport did not have a curfew. This was due to good tailwinds over continental Australia. I sat in 1E and it was just your normal budget airline. The staff were really friendly and clearly trained very well. There is nothing to really complain about, you get what you paid for, a cheap flight. Cheap seats, cheap cabin and no entertainment. The only thing I would say is that they should increase their menu or put more variety on.",0
2016,"Travelled Hanoi to Danang with Jetstar. Online check-in not possible for that stretch. I arrived from International T2 terminal only 25 Minutes before my domestic departure with Jetstar. Jetstar check-in staff was alerted and extremely cooperative to accommodate me on board, despite I had to rush unbelievably. I caused a minor delay of 5 minutes but we arrived on time. As my luggage obviously could not make it, it was, later the same day, with quick assistance from Jetstar, sent with the competing airline, Vietjetair - and I picked it in Danang airport after a few formalities. Onboard on the A320, I found a very good service by FAs. Food, drinks, items for purchase at OK prices. Good value for money, surprisingly professional handling, despite denoted as a Low Cost Carrier.",0
2016,"Flew from Tokyo (Narita) to Melbourne. Check-in opened 3 hours before departure, but there was already a long queue. It was still a half hour wait to be checked in. Staff however were efficient and polite. Boarding was completed ahead of time but the flight still departed nearly ten minutes late. But that is punctual for Jetstar so I can't complain. The economy seat was not comfortable but acceptable, except the IFE was not operating. I hadn't included it in my options but I did need to charge my iPhone and iPad so I could continue to access my own 'entertainment package'. But the USB port was not functioning either. I mentioned it to staff after a couple of hours (the batteries were flat). Staff offered to relocate me to a seat where the IFE worked and also offered complimentary access to the IFE to compensate for the inconvenience. Sensible and polite. That's a tick. I brought my own picnic lunch/dinner - 2 boiled eggs, 2 rolls, 3 onigiri (Japanese rice balls), some fruit and a bottle of water purchased in the boarding area. This was fortuitous as the offered fried rice/noodles options looked OK but pedestrian whereas my little 'picnic' meals were appetising and delicious. It's another tick for Jetstar that they make meals optional and allow you to bring your own. For a cost conscious traveller, Jetstar is now OK (delays notwithstanding). It's spartan but by preparing your own entertainment and meals ahead of the flight, you can make it much more pleasant.",0
2016,"Rarotonga to Auckland with Jetstar. Most unorganised set up to ever exist. Haven't flown with them in years because it's always a bad experience, but had not choice on dates and times this time around. No surprise Jetstar still manages to stuff it all up. Late departure because of paperwork problems, then even later departure because they managed to double booked seats on the plane. Simple things they can't get right. I'd rather break my leg than deal with this outfit again.",1
2016,"Hong Kong to Melbourne via Singapore. Extremely unreliable. I could've not have in-flight entertainment, or meals. I would not have care as much about the delay, but my god are they disorganised! Flight was delayed by 21 hours. Scheduled for 3:50pm, then rescheduled for 5:45pm, then again for 6:20pm. Checkout from the hotel was changed from 2:00pm (which would have worked out great) to 12:00pm. Now I'm stuck in the airport for 6 hours, with zero assurance the flight will be scheduled for the time specified. Pay the extra couple of hundred for a better airline, or if you have no other choice, don't bother, extend your stay a couple more nights and book with another airline, otherwise they're likely to extend it for you, in your stop-over, indefinitely.",1
2016,"Flew Denpasar to Melbourne on the Boeing 787 and I have to say that the experience was unsatisfying, if not to say miserable. It did not feel like a normal flight on another aircraft type, but it instead felt much worse than that. We already had a 30mins delay waiting for pushback from Bali's Ngurah Rai airport, for a reason the pilot did not even announce. Additionally it was a red-eye flight, which means that sleep is important on such flight. However this is the least duration of sleep I could ever get on a red eye flight which will be explained further below. Mood lighting was there but not effective at all. The IFE was there with a responsive touchscreen, although money is required to pay for most of the IFE content. Seats were horrible. Leather seats are not at all comfortable, inhibits sleep, as well as those hard headrests that felt very weird to adjust. Seat itself was very narrow at less than 17 inches, and armrest was ridiculously narrow not a hand can comfortably rest on them. The seat pitch was also very narrow at what felt like 30 inches, extremely cramped, and all these contributed to my sleeplessness. What's more the plane was scorching hot, so more than an hour of sleep seems like an incredible feat to do on such a plane. Meal was bland, only the sauce had a slight bit of flavour, although the dessert made up for the bad food. Cabin crew were average with nothing remarkable to speak of. The same can be said on the return flight. Hot plane, narrow seats, bland food but with great deserts, average crew, same IFE. Unfortunately the return flight was much worse, the humidity was causing my runny noise for about an hour. Shades were not able to block light fully.  I cannot recommend longhaul flying with the 787 as well as with Jetstar.",1
2016,"Flew Palmerston North to Auckland. It comes down to this: You will get from A to B - but not necessarily when you expected. So if you can afford the time slippages - then $ for $ this is the cheapest solution. Don't fly Jetstar if you have to attend an event or connect with another flight. Is it just my imagination - or does the equation come down to the Jetstar Operations Management canvassing the details and going: - hmmm we don't have a full flight - so we won't spend the $ running the service yet. We'll employ Excuse Code No: 5 of about 10 - which in my case was ""your aircraft has been delayed in Auckland due to 'engineering requirements'"", thus we can merge the two half empty flights into one - and save on the running costs. Who knows - but it's mighty suspicious when you would expect the airport to be full of 2 sets of passengers waiting to travel - yet hello - it was still just one plane load 3 and a half hours later. So again - for the cheapest option from A to B and it doesn't matter if you get delayed - go for it. As for me, even though I could kind of afford to wait - it just wasn't really an enjoyable experience. Get your complimentary voucher when told there's a delay.",1
2016,"Queenstown to Auckland - the downside to flying Jetstar from Queenstown is the 40 min wait in line to check-in. Then to be told your flight is delayed by over an hour and I'm not sure we were told the actual reason for the delay. Don't get me wrong I know these are ""first world problems"" but if Jetstar want to be a contender with AirNZ on more than just price they need to do way way better in this area. The staff were friendly enough and the queue was not actually that long, but without having self check-in facilities, having on average just 2 staff check people in was not enough. In comparison, all the AirNZ / Virgin Australia check-ins operating (about 6 or so) and they have self service check-ins - hence no real queue there. Therefore my rating for Jetstar, and Qantas for that matter, for check-in service out of Queenstown is 1/10. While I can't rate the delayed flight home at this point, on balance, everything about the flight to Queenstown from Auckland was great. Easy check-in, no delays and comfortable enough flight (although we were lucky and had 6 seats between the 4 of us) on which the crew were great. So 9/10 for that part of the trip. Overall I'll rate my Jetstar experience so far 5/10 and I would recommend them to friends and family but it will come with a warning that you generally get what you pay for.",0
2016,"Flew Jetstar Airways from Cairns to Adelaide. Seat 1A - definitely worth the few extra $s for the legroom as (like most economy classes these days, including Virgin Australia and Qantas) passengers squeezed in like sardines, especially those in middle seats. Couldn't fault the flight, despite a 20 minute delay due to having to offload luggage in Adelaide belonging to a no-show passenger. Thanks to a strong tail wind, flight took only 2hrs 40 mins. Flight attendants were friendly and professional, and the female co-pilot and her captain brought the aircraft in for the smoothest landing I've experienced. Is it because I was in an exit seat that I was referred to by my first name whenever the flight attendant spoke to me? Closest thing to feeling like a business class passenger on a budget airline. Have flown Jetstar on four occasions now, and have never had a problem.",0
2016,"Jetstar Airways flight from Sydney to Melbourne cancelled before the incoming had arrived (courtesy of FlightTracker24) but fifteen minutes anyway. Reason given is ""scheduled engineering"", if this airline pretends that when they would logically have known weeks in advance is 1) lying 2) incomptent 3) assuming their passengers are incompetent, or 4) all of the above. Rebooked to flight following 60 minutes later. Okay. Board. Sit. Wait. Bored. Over the next two hours there are no fewer than 7 announcements from The Deck explaining how it'll be ""five or ten more minutes"". I'm going with a comination of 2) and 3) above.",1
2016,"Adelaide to Cairns with Jetstar. Had the exit row both ways which made the difference on a 3 hour flight. Found the staff quite pleasant to Cairns and on the return. Paid $40.00 extra for checked bags, seat selection, $10.00 food voucher (chose tea and muffin), and Qantus points, again worth it I think. Overall a good flight and good value. Should note though that leg room in standard seating isn't great.",0
2016,"Auckland to New Plymouth with Jetstar. If you want to have a hassle free experience, do not book Jetstar. I have been on multiple flights with Jetstar - as I am a student I always go with the cheapest option because I simply cannot afford to pay other fares. Every Jetstar flight I have travelled on to or from New Plymouth has been delayed with minimal warning. This morning I had a 6am flight that was cancelled, however, because I know of the unreliability of this airline, I made sure and checked the website, app and my email prior to leaving which said the flight was on schedule. I found out when I arrived at the airport that the flight was cancelled due to ""crewing requirements"", I asked when was this flight cancelled? and Jetstar said at 3am. I did not get an email until 5am stating the cancellation, a time in which I had already left for the airport. Jetstar offered a bus service down to New Plymouth or a flight the following day, which is completely worthless to me as I needed to be in New Plymouth by 7am. So instead I asked for a refund which is going to take 2 weeks to receive. I do not recommend this airline - the cheaper fare is not worth the hassle that will end up costing you more.",1
2016,"Melbourne to Phuket. Once we got going the flight was great, however we suffered a 10hr delay due to a breakdown, an then another 45 minutes while the plane was cleaned. We were offered a $50.00 Jestar voucher as compensation and told to claim any other out of pockets from our insurance, I think that this is pretty poor. While Jetstar calls this business class it really should be called for what it is and that is premium economy, meals where good and staff were attentive and it is far better than sitting at the back of the plane. The price and service was similar to a premium economy ticket on Qantas or Singapore Airlines, however even despite being called business class their is no priority luggage with Jetstar.",1
2016,"Melbourne to Tokyo Narita return and would say Jetstar is my favorite Low cost long haul carrier. Plane on both journey was beautiful, seat was comfortable, food was very good for me and affordable as well. IFE was fine though dissapointed as not much selection, still ok to keep me entertained on the close to 10hr flight. Was a good experience for me as well to try the Boeing 787, very nice and quiet aircraft. Would definitely fly them again on their international routes as thier prices are very reasonable.",0
2016,"This is about the 4th time I have flown Jetstar star class. If you know what to expect then you will be happy. If you want lie flat beds and all the trimmings then you are kidding yourself. My flight on May 10 from Melbourne to Bangkok was great. Check in staff were grumpy, but I got over that. The seats are comfortable enough for a daytime flight with plenty of legroom, just not much recline. The food was good, not up to some airlines business class but not too far off it. Wine selection and quality was good. The Thai staff were very good. The cabin is only 3 rows for star class, smaller than I have had in the past, but that is good as you get better service and no queueing for the toilet. We were first on and first off the plane. Qantas Lounge in Melbourne is okay, but needs a refresh, a bit tired compared to say Singapore or Hong Kong, or even Los Angeles. Overall I think it is a good deal and an alternative to Qantas premium economy, which I would rate about the same, which makes sense as the cost is similar for routes of the same length.",0
2016,"Osaka to Sydney via Cairns. When I am paying over a thousand bucks for a return to Japan on low cost airline Jetstar, I am paying the equivalent for a return flight to Europe. So surely the term low cost airline refers here to the shoestring budget Jetstar its service is based on and not the price tags of its flights to Japan. I am venting my frustration because there is a lack of competition. Jetstar is the main airline offering services to and from Japan. On this particular journey the flight was cancelled due to technical errors with the airplane. As a result it is taking hours to get things sorted for accommodation and rebooking. Yet I am paying a more than low-budget price for the flight.",1
2016,"Flew Jetstar from Sydney to Adelaide and return. Departed Sydney twenty minutes late and arrived in Adelaide 15 minutes behind schedule. The return was worse as we departed Adelaide thirty minutes late and arrived in Sydney twenty-five minutes late. While the return flight was late after delays in Melbourne because of the weather, it is still unacceptable. Jetstar needs to lift its game or re-schedule flights further apart to regain punctuality. On the plus side, I asked for aisle seats for both legs at check in and was accommodated with no fuss and a big smile.",0
2016,"Singapore to Melbourne. We have traveled with Jetstar before from Hawaii business class and we said, never again. Now we were traveling from Singapore on a new airline the Boeing 787 and thought this time it would be okay. Again we purchased a Business Class ticket. We came off a cruise and were taken to the airport 9 hours before our flight. We went to Qantas/Jetstar Business Lounge, where we were told we are not allowed to enter as we are not Qantas Club members (we could join for $600 ea!) and we were supposed to purchase some kind of package when we bought our Business Class ticket to allow us to use the Lounge. I said, no problem, I will purchase it now, but was told it can only be done online when you purchase the tickets! So no matter that I paid all that extra money on a Business class, we were not allowed to use the Business Lounge. This is the first and only airline who did this, we never had this problem before. On the plane, the Business Class is like the Premium Economy of other airlines. Virtually no leg room, seats are very narrow, nothing like a Business Class seat should be. Extremely disappointed, will never travel with Jetstar again and won't recommend it to anybody.",1
2016,"Queenstown to Melbourne. In my 40 years of travel this was the absolute worst service ever encountered. As a result of a minor problem with Australian visa and Jetstar refusal to assist, we missed the first leg of international flights and had to re-book. This resulted in spending two nights on airport floors, loss of a paid hotel accomodation, and re-booking fees. The visa was a very minor issue, and a competing airline a few feet away took care of the matter for us in a matter of minutes after Jetstar refusal. Unfortunately, Jetstar had closed the boarding gate and we missed the flight. The counter personnel at the Queenstown airport were extemely rude. In addition, the Jetstar website is very confusing. At the time of purchasing tickets one month in advance, I paid $50 luggage fees. At the time of boarding, we were charged $420 additional fees for two pieces of luggage. The fees were paid and at the next stop in Auckland enroute to Melbourne, the agent attempted to collect additional luggage fees. Again, the personnel were extemely rude and required receipts for the previous payment because the computer didn't contain records. We contested these charges after returning home, but received only long-winded explanations as to why Jetstar bore no responsiblity. This is the absolute worst airline and the most expensive of all the flights due to luggage fees, re-booking, lost hotel charges.",1
2016,"My aunt (89) was booked to take this domestic flight from Auckland to Nelson, but was late to the check-in counter. Instead of refusing to assist, Jetstar organised an airport hotel, transport to/from, meal voucher, and booked her on the following morning's flight. This went several extra miles beyond what they were required to do, and was much appreciated by our family. Also pleased to see Jetstar in NZ has finally agreed to switch from opt-out to opt-in for extras such as baggage etc on their flights, starting in May 2016.",0
2016,"Poor Jetstar check in staff at Christchurch Airport. It was terrible service to guest. I added the wheelchair service for my grandma but they didn't prepare staff or the wheelchair. I brought it from outside by myself and even then, they were asking me to take her to aircraft. Ok, I understand it gets busy, but when I arrive at the boarding area, they made me wait and boarding at the last. It was 7am flight, and I'm really disappointed in Jetstar service.",1
2016,"Melbourne to Singapore with Jetstar. Overall a pleasant experience, but marred by extremely poor service from Jetstar check-in staff. They ignored Business Class passengers while bickering among themselves, avoiding all eye contact with waiting Jetstar customers. No explanation or apology was given for failing to attend to passengers. After 10 minutes of this we moved to the Economy Class check-in queue, where the process was efficiently handled. I have flown Jetstar Business Class a couple of times and have not encountered such rudeness. Everything else about the flight was fine: punctuality, comfort, friendly and efficient on-board service, and pretty good food. I am sure it was just a couple of rotten apples at the Melbourne Jetstar counters who let the company down, but they urgently need retraining about customer service!",0
2016,"Perth to Tokyo Narita via Cairns with Jetstar. My 2 flights were okay Jetstar considering it was lost cost. My first flight was at the worst flying time (midnight - 4:30) after that flight I was extremely tired and fell asleep on a bunch of chairs for my 6 hour layover at Cairns, (would say try to avoid Cairns due to awkward flying times). Anyway, flight attendants we're a bit chatty throughout the flights but were friendly and helpful. We got food for free on second flight bc we paid for baggage. Probably one of the nicer meals I had on flights. First flight on an A320 the seats were not the most comfortable but on the 2nd flight we sat at a bulkhead so heaps of legroom. Overall I would say very good for a budget airline and a high value for money.",0
2016,"Jetstar Airways continues to excel in its field. With carry on only, this was one of the easiest flights I have taken in many years from Launceston to Sydney. The Cabin Crew were, as usual, courteous and efficient. I found seat 17F a little tight as compared to my previous A321 seat 12A (no seat in front). I don't think that seat pitch varies from A320 to A320. For less than two hours, this was not a problem. I did not purchase food or drink, and declined the scratch card offer (quite difficult to redeem). I will continue to fly Jetstar, and I highly recommend this LCC.",0
2016,"Jetstar were terrible from start to finish flying from Manila to Singapore. Having booked my ticket online and pre-paid for hold luggage and a meal on board I was told at check-in that I hadn't paid for baggage. The check in attendant was adamant that I hadn't paid but after a phone call to their service centre it was confirmed that I had paid for baggage and food. Problem solved - or maybe not. Once we had taken off, the pre-paid meals started arriving, having been through this process a number of times with other airlines I had my boarding card out ready to be checked. 30 minutes later my meal hadn't arrived so I spoke to one of the flight attendants who were again adamant that I had not paid for a meal (even though check in had confirmed this!). I even showed my booking confirmation to which I was still denied a meal as it wasn't on their sheet. I was point blank refused a meal. Fairly cheesed off I wrote in to the customer service department to complain. The service didn't get any better, in fact I would say it got worse. Having explained the situation I was offered a AUS$25 voucher to be used on jetstar.com.",1
2016,"Melbourne Avalon to Sydney with Jetstar was the worst experience ever. Found staff unfriendly at Avalon airport. Mindest of revenue generation. Even though I had paid for extra luggage and not used the total allocated allowance, they wouldn't let me take my handbag on board as it was slightly over. I did express for safety I would put the laptop under the seat not in the hat rack above, but this was not allowed. Even on a flight that wasn't full.",1
2016,"Jetstar is a non nonsense airline with everything pretty what you would expect for a low cost carrier. The flight from Auckland to Wellington was a great price and I choose the ""add ons"" that I needed. The snack was pleasant enough for the short flight, the small cup of water could have been a little bottle, but again it is a short flight and I had my own. Seats are tight and limited leg room, same as any other carrier really. Cabin crew were efficient, knew who had pre ordered, they made eye contact used your name little things that made the flight a little more relaxed and friendly.",0
2016,"Melbourne to Tokyo Narita via Cairns. I had a choice for the same price, between Cathay Pacific in economy via Hong Kong or Jetstar in business class via Cairns. Jetstar had more convenient timings so I took the chance. Then I panicked because the ticket and the website indicated that I would have to collect my bags in Cairns and check back in. However, at check-in in Melbourne, I was given both boarding passes and my bags were checked through to Tokyo - this seems to be the norm for the Tokyo and Osaka flights but I cant find anywhere where I was told that in advance. A good thing, too, since the Melbourne-Cairns flight left 63 minutes late despite boarding on time (theyve got a reputation to maintain). The flight to Cairns had no business section so I was stuck in economy in an exit row seat, plenty of room but next to the noisy galley and toilets. The Boeing 787s electronically-dimmed windows just dont work in direct sun and my head got very hot and it was impossible to sleep. The quieter engines dont translate into a quieter cabin - seems like some machinery is very loud, perhaps for the higher cabin pressures (the higher pressures may however have reduced the screaming from the usual gaggle of families). On the the Cairns-Tokyo leg I was in the first business row and its directly equivalent to premium economy elsewhere. The seat actually felt less roomy than the Cathay Pacific premium economy I was in a few weeks ago, even though 2x3x2 in a 787 should have more space than 2x3x2 in the narrower A330. The food was fairly good but they offered lower-end alcohol options compared to most airlines. Maybe the busines class is worth considering for a point-to-point long-haul flight (as long as its cheaper than others premium economy), but its still Jetstar.",1
2016,"Have flown Jetstar Business international on many occasions and the crew has always been energetic, engaging and very pleasant. On this flight from Melbourne to Singapore though the crew were robotic, devoid of personality and as much as I hate to say it, soulless. At one stage a FA came past and tapped her index finger on the arm rest where the tray table is stowed to indicate for us to get the tray out, I guess speaking would be too much to ask for! Would fly Jetstar again but hope to get a crew with personality.",0
2016,"I flew Jetstar quite a bit during my month in Australia and NZ in Feb and March. This is a budget airline so you get what you pay for. I encountered no problems, my seat was ok, I ate before my flights so did not have to resort to expensive tasteless airline food and the flight attendants were competent and helpful - with one exception. This was the Queenstown to Sydney JQ224 on 13 March which was staffed by strange beings that had definitely not been trained properly since they lacked the usual easy-going but professional attitude of other flight crews I encountered and their appearance and uniforms were not up to standard. I would quite happily fly Jetstar again and would just ask them to improve one thing - their onboard PA announcements. I do not know why the flight and cabin crew find it necessary to rush and gabble their announcements; their audience is belted into seats with very little else to do other than to sit still and listen to them. It would be very nice to hear all of what the pilot or attendant is telling us about the route and arrival times etc instead of having to listen to badly delivered gabble. It made me wonder how they would get their message across in a crisis.",0
2016,"Short haul budget flight from Sydney to Sunshine Coast on Jetstar Airways. The service was great, crew was friendly and cheerful - overall, nothing to complain. The return leg, I was a little sick and was given special attention from the crew.",0
2016,"Flew economy Melbourne to Bangkok on one of Jetstar's new 787's. I've never previously flown international with Jetstar but have done so with AirAsia X, so in my mind I was comparing the two budget carriers. The whole process of checking in and boarding was smooth and easy starting from the automatic baggage drop off. Tuesday morning at Tullamarine was a breeze to get through customs. Boarding was on time. Seats were very comfortable and leg room didn't feel any different to the full service economy cabins I've flown with. My prebooked meal tasted great and the hot snack that came with it later in the fight also tasted good. Entertainment was no where near say Emirates standard but for a budget carrier the selection of movies were fantastic, especially when you consider other budget airlines don't even have seatback screens. I watched 3 new movies and that pretty much took me through the whole flight. We touched down in Bangkok 50 minutes ahead of schedule! After this flight Jetstar has definitely won my future business.",0
2016,"Ticket cost $166.00, one extra bag cost $350.00. Travelers beware. I've been on eight flights using four airlines in the past eleven days throughout Australia and New Zealand and today I checked into my first Jetstar flight from Christchurch to Auckland. I went to the kiosk as I have numerous times this week prepared to spend up to $50.00 for my second of two bags. I was referred to the counter. Once weighed, I was informed that I was allowed 21 kilos, about 3 kilos less than the standard suitcase weight maximum. They explained that I had only purchased one bag and that I no longer had the option of adding a suitcase to my fare. They informed me that I was 23 kilos over and that would cost me $350.00. Quantas and Virgin happily charged for my additional bag and it was about $50.00. Astonished by their assertion, I asked if it would be possible to purchase it online. They promptly canceled my boarding pass and gave me an 800 number to call. I spoke to an agent and, once again, I was quoted policy. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they told me to speak to a supervisor at the airport and again, I was quoted policy. I thew out my shampoo and conditioner, shifted a few things into my purse and briefcase and checked in. I picked up a cup of tea before boarding as I have 100 times before and Jetstar made me throw it out before boarding. Thought it was odd as the other airlines always allowed it. Then they tried to sell me tea on board. It's small change, but how tacky. Great airline if you enjoy being duped. I'll never give Jetstar the opportunity to do it to me again.",1
2016,"Excellent experience all around with Jetstar from Auckland to Nelson. No check in queue, the staff member at the bag drop smiled and spoke to me. Flight attendant excellent, flight on time with no hassles at all. Baggage delivery very quick in Nelson. Why oh why can't Jetstar Australia be like this?",0
2016,"Christchurch to Hobart via Melbourne. I enjoy flying with Jetstar Airways. Friendly service, and engaging cabin crew.  Melbourne bag drop assistants excelling, you saved me a lot of dollars with the ""try rearranging a few items"", after having arrived for a connecting flight with my duty free goods.  Two minor problems. Should passengers in the over-wing exits be sleeping (or pretending to), during the safety demonstration and where do Jetstar source luggage handlers? One suitcase arrived at Hobart in pieces (literally!). I will continue to fly Jetstar and not obsess over a minor hiccup.",0
2016,"Flew from Melbourne to Bangkok with Jetstar Airways. It was the best flight, service, food etc. we have experienced in the last 5 years. Courtesy and work ethic of the Thai cabin crew was excellent. Food and drinks were quality all the way. Short delay before take-off for technical fault. Much better than many 'full service airlines' we have flown recently.",0
2016,"Yet again, Jetstar Airways excel in the skies. I cannot rate this airline highly enough. However, Jetstar fall completely on their face when it comes to attitude, competency and efficiency in relation to their ground-based passenger service. I had a six hour connection time in Melbourne. Arriving from Hobart at 1800, check-in for my Christchurch flight did not open until 2045. I was unable to access a charging point for my laptop, without being processed by a security check point. That meant I would have had to dispose of a few items packed in my checked luggage. (I was not able to check my bag through from HBA to CHC). When check-in for my flight finally opened, I found that I was slightly over the carry-on weight limit. This meant packing my laptop and charger in my 20kg allowance. Thus no laptop or charger to use while waiting for departure. At self check-in, the JQ system could only recognise me on a flight which would take me to the wrong destination. As directed, I approached a check-in agent, weaving my way through many JQ staff who seemed intent on chatting with one another, and ignoring passengers. The rudeness intensified with the agent I chose. Obviously someone who had experienced an unpleasant day, and also someone who made it quite obvious that he or she did not want to be there. Once in the departure lounge, things changed completely, and the excellent Jetstar service returned, even to the point of an offer of changing seats into an exit row in the aircraft. I graciously accepted, and thoroughly enjoyed the flight right through to my destination. A minor hiccup, but an unnecessary one, this will not deter me from flying with JQ. I still highly recommend this airline.",0
2016,"Have done the Denpasar to Melbourne route with Jetstar for the last few years and always dread the flight home - the Indonesian cabin crew do not seem to have time for customer service and seem abrupt to the point of rudeness. Only interested in getting the cabin service over so they can sit and chat amongst themselves. Have encountered this now on 2 occasions. Whether it's a language barrier I don't know, but no comparison to the friendly Australian crew - will choose another carrier next time for return leg.",0
2016,"Following the Jetstar email suggestion I web checked in but upon arrival there was no web check counter so joined a 45 minute check in queue. The fit out of the 787 for my flight from Tokyo to Cairns was the most cramped of any plane I have flown on besides maybe small turbo props. I had to have my legs slightly sideways the whole flight, and the back of the seat in front was closer than I have experienced on a jet before and I have flown all the low cost carriers, you were literally shoe horned in like a sardine with no room to move. Really surprised me being a new 787 I expected it might be a nice fit out but actually the opposite. For me Jetstar have crossed a line with this latest ultra tight squeeze seating and I will only use them for short haul flights in future when they are occasionally competitive on price.",1
2016,"Yet again, Jetstar shines brightly in the LCC skies. Simplicity and efficiency go hand in hand with another two flights from Hobart to Melbourne made so pleasant by the friendliness of happy and competent Cabin Crews, battling to satisfy very demanding passengers on short (less than one hour) flights. I would like to see the removal of food/drink services on short flights. Less weight using less fuel may even reduce costs further? A dream perhaps, but one worth considering. I cannot rate this airline highly enough. I am totally satisfied from check-in to baggage collection.",0
2016,Sincere thanks to wonderful staff at the Sunshine Coast airport and T4 Terminal at Tullamarine Airport on 13th February. I badly sprained my ankle and would not have been able to return home without their assistance. They did everything to make my return home as comfortable as possible. Their assistance was given willingly and cheerfully. Thanks again to these wonderful staff.,0
2016,"Jetstar provided an excellent low-cost service from Melbourne to Hobart. A departure time of 0605 ensures that approximately half of the passengers fall asleep before the aircraft leaves the ground. Thus inflight service is quick and efficient. I purchased seat 1D for $11 because I needed to exit the aircraft ASAP. The downside was that nearly every passenger swiped my head with their shoulder bag whilst boarding. I won't do this again in a hurry. The flight departed on time and arrived early. The passengers are the problem. A pleasant request to ""return tray tables to the upright position"", is not rocket science. Jetstar is doing an excellent execution of affable LCC operations.",0
2016,"Jetstar Airways flight from Honolulu to Sydney on January 28th 2016, due to arrive in Sydney on Jan 29th at 3 pm. We were due to board at about 8 am, after being queued in the longest queue to check in (hundreds of metres long) and then walking to the Jetstar lounge which was not opened for ages. Just about to get onto the aircraft when there is an announcement that the ""flight is cancelled due to engine issues"". Immediately there are text messages to our phone confirming the flight cancellation and giving advice about contacting airline for a refund. That was the last communication I got from Jetstar. If I had waited for them to contact me I would still be sitting in Honolulu. Shipped off en masse to the airport hotel, with vouchers for $30 worth of food per person per day (which gets you about one course in Honolulu). The buses or taxis which never seemed to arrive, and we get there about 2 hours later after collecting our luggage and lining up like a flock of sheep on the sidewalk. We sit in our hotel for the best part of 2 days. No communication from Jetstar. Jetstar extends our time in the hotel for an extra day. No news about what is wrong with their plane our how long it will be till it is fixed. No suggestion of any replacement aircraft or switching us to Qantas or Hawaiian. When I go back to the airport I am told they be able to get you on a flight on about the 3rd or 4th of February. I go back to the hotel, manage to eventually book a flight with Air New Zealand to Auckland, then to Sydney with Qantas. We finally get back to Sydney on January 31st in the afternoon. Still have not heard a word from Jetstar. They probably still think we are in the airport hotel.",1
2016,Denpasar to Sydney with Jetstar Airways - extremely poor communication and service. Had thought the lack of coordination and shabby service on the way was just perception however on return I now understand this is simply Jetstar's standard. Flight was delayed without explanation by 5 hours and then further delayed by abother 3 hours. Airport staff unable to give details regarding onward connecting flights or expected time for arrival. For me the delay resulted in a 36 hour working day without apology or compensation. Not good enough Jetstar. This bare basic service is definitely not worth any minute ticket saving. Certainly would never travel use again.,1
2016,"The Jetstar Airways so-called business class cabin is extremely cramped with seats more difficult to exit than most economy ones on other carriers. With other airlines providing an infinitely superior product at a lower cost, albeit with a one stop service, Jetstar is just not worth it. Pleasant and cheerful crew but they could do nothing about the inadequate seating and facilities in the cabin. My flight from Melbourne to Bangkok is not an experience I would want to repeat in a hurry. Unfortunately it's a return ticket with the same carrier. Overall: uncomfortable and poor value.",1
2016,"Phuket to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways. Avoid like the plague. Flight was rearranged with no real explanation. Contacted the customer service team who gave me conflicting information.

2016,"Honolulu to Sydney via Melbourne. After our Jetstar flight was cancelled due to major engine issues we still await word on how they are getting us home. It seems Jetstar has abandoned its passengers and whats worse will not pay for our accomodation or food while we wait to be flown home. Its only after taking matters into my own hands by calling the airline and booking another flight that I'm getting out, otherwise I'm sure i would have been here a lot longer. With no money to pay for this either I had to take out an overdraw on my bank account leaving me in debt. Still awaiting some answers from this abysmal airline they call Jetstar.",1
2016,"I booked a last minute, one way shared flight from Singapore to Perth on Monday January 25th, 2016 with Jetstar Airways as a Qantas frequent flyer. I added the max bundle which gave me 40 kg of luggage, seat choice and lounge access. My check in was done in a unsmiling, perfunctory manner even though there was no queue. The Qantas lounge was wonderful and the highlight of this experience. The seats are standard throughout the plane (small plane, central aisle with three seats either side. My seat was worn vinyl and very uncomfortable. My meal was unappealing and unfortunately the sauce was spilt onto my leg as it was being served. The staff never acknowledged my experience nor offered any apology. My family commute often via Singapore and I will be avoiding this flight from now on if it is serviced by Jetstar.",1
2016,"I arrived at Melbourne from London with Emirates, and made my way to the Jetstar counter for the flight from Melbourne to Hobart. It was 3.50am on 30th December 2015. A Jetstar employee was walking towards me while I was standing at the counter, and I said ""excuse me"". She walked straight past me saying ""we open at 4"". I said ""I just want to...."" where she cut me dead with ""I said 4'o clock!"". She rounded this off with look of death. I can't believe Jetstar would put someone with her attitude anywhere near paying customers. I will never fly Jetstar again and next time I go to Australia (later this year) will go via Sydney.",1
2016,"Honolulu to Sydney with Jetstar Airways, Our carry on size baggage exceeded the airline 7 kg limit, so we were forced to check it and pay $160 per bag, an extraordinary high fee. Then one of the bags was damaged on the flight and they refused to refund the fee, and are asking us to jump through various hoops to get reimbursed. On the return trip, they failed to bring my walker up to the aircraft for me to disembark with. Baggage was damaged a second time. The staff seemed exceedingly poorly trained and indifferent to customers. Quite a frustrating experience.",1

Each of the four passengers on our booking also received this letter emailed to our travel agent by Jetstar. Having put in our claim for reimbursement, we have been advised by Jetstar that as a booking of four passengers, we were only going to be reimbursed SGD$150 for all four of us for accommodation (it is impossible to get a reasonable room in Singapore for 4 people at this rate). Its the first time we have flown Jetstar overseas and it will be our last.",1
2016,"Singapore to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways business class. Boeing 787 new and quite quiet in the front. Hate the electronic window shading, was in control of the cabin staff so it was either all open or all dark. It was a night flight and I was watching the huge fires and some wicked lightening storms till they darkened the windows for people to sleep. Sorry but what was happening out the window was better than the in-seat entertainment. The seat has plenty of leg room but I don't think there was one seat where the recline/foot rest worked properly - there was a lot of times when the cabin crew were wrestling with seat. Recline is huge but you're reclining into the space of the person behind you. It happened to me - the tiny TV drops to where you can't view it unless your neck is double-jointed. You can't get up to go to the toilet without some contortions and using the headrest of the seat in front and then you receive that disgusted look because you woke them up.  Entertainment small screen was just that, small, very small and not great quality. And I ran out of movies to watch about 3 hours from touchdown on a 7.5 hour flight. What an awful poor choice - and in Business class! Food not quite as good as other airlines economy food. I was in row 2 of business class and they ran out of the first choice in row 2. Well actually they didn't run out because our friends (also in row 2) shortly after being fobbed off with the fish, noted that row 2 and 3 of the other side of the business cabin got the first choice. So that's a bit of an insult to be told that it's out to then watch people being served it after you. First choice - a Pie, no veggies, no potatoes, nothing but a pie! Had to check I was in business class! Drinks offer a good choice, and always there if you wanted it. Cabin staff were mainly good and attentive (not that we wanted much) but a bit disappointed with the lack of checking for meals. Goodies Pack was great:- earplugs, eye mask, toothbrush, tube socks (not so great), hand cream, lip balm, neck pillow and the bag it came in can be used as a computer tablet bag. There is one thing that all airlines should realize; tube socks don't work in the toilet (think about it). Ground service I've marked low for one reason - although we were the first off the plane we were last away from the baggage carousel as our bags came out last (that will teach us to be first at the airport!) Business class baggage came out last! Overall the whole thing was very amateurish, I wasn't expecting top of the line business class, but it should have been up to at least premium economy standards of other airlines. Not sure how they can market this as business class. I doubt I will use them again for this sort of travel.",1
2016,"Jetstar Airways from Cairns to Sydney, and a nickel and dime airline! Paid $300 to check 2 bags on my flight. They acted like it wasn't a big deal and there was not a thing they could or would do to help my situation. This is all because we didn't check the box to check our baggage when booking through a third party website - an option we don't remember seeing. You have to pay for all drinks, except a cup of warm water. You don't save money with this airline, and they will nickel and dime you until you pay just as much or more as another airline, who has all of their fees upfront.",1

I went through a period several years ago when I avoided Jetstar for similar reasons and thought they may have improved but was obviously wrong. Won't go back for a third time.",1
2016,"Christchurch to Sydney flight delayed by 30-35 minutes with no explanation. Ground staff at gate clueless. Turns out the airport has dual boarding / deplaning lanes and shared gate areas so had to clear one flight before allowing ours to board. Had the emergency exit row, which made for a better experience than our previous flight, from MEL to CHC. Cabin crew very pleasant and planes are clean. Still, has a cattle class feel. Why does Jetstar and Qantas have flights on the same route departing within 10 minutes of each other?",0
2016,"Bali to Melbourne via Perth with Jetstar. They charge you exorbitantly ($150 AUD/piece) for luggage that isn't prepaid. Any luggage after the single piece per person is charged at the rate of $25 (Austr) per kg. They hit you with this when you're checking in and have no recourse. If you protest even minimally, they threaten to deny you boarding. Jetstar also cancels flights without any notice and leave you at the airport with no reasonable alternatives. They cancelled our Dec 28 flight and offered to book us a new one in 4 days time! We of course lost the first night's deposit ($320 AUD) we had placed on the hotel that we were then forced to cancel. The promised refund for the cancelled flights has not yet materialised. Be warned.",1
2016,"We booked and paid for our Jetstar Airways flights from Bali to Melbourne, direct flights. Two hours before check in, I get an email saying the flight has been cancelled because of engineering requirements. We had to re book our flights at a later date, and the best we could get was Bali to Brisbane and then Brisbane to Melbourne. That's ok, what I'm not ok with is been charged extra money by Jetstar for a 4 hour longer flight and being offered zero compensation. A joke of a company with terrible customer service.",1
2016,"Business Class from Sydney to Denpasar on Jetstar. Its a shame I didn't book the return leg instead. The 1720 departure meant a relatively late arrival in Denpasar, but dinner was served. The meal was impressive. I did not mind the seats being somewhat firm, given we were in the first row, but the foot rest and limited recline meant some moving around to get comfortable. The crew were friendly and attentive. Only complaint was the time taken to retrieve bags in Denpasar. The Boeing 787 beats the other aircraft flying this route for comfort.",0
2016,"Melbourne to Christchurch on Jetstar. Friendly and efficient cabin crew, clean aircraft and efficient boarding. Seating is cramped to the point of being painful. Flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. For a 2 hour 45 minute flight, it's fine. A lot of choice in terms of extras on board (food, entertainment) which can help pass the time.",0
2016,"Auckland to Nelson, and Jetstar was pretty much what we thought it would be. A basic trip where you could pay for add-ons (like getting certain seats and drinks). Our flight was short, so we didn't really care about any of those ad-ons and thought we got a good deal on a flight. The checked bags also weren't that expensive compared to some airlines charge you per bag here in the states. I guess if you were flying further, this airline might not be the way to go since they don't seem to have any onboard services.",0
2016,"Flying with Jetstar was an absolute nightmare. I flew from Perth to Cairns for a few days and they left my baggage in Perth. First they told me I'd be getting my baggage the next day- which I thought was reasonable. Now, they're telling me that they can't do anything about it and that my baggage will only come the day before I'm due to leave Cairns. All they said was that they will reimburse me the money I need to get new clothes and toiletries - when I send them the receipts. Firstly, my chargers are all in my baggage and my electronics are dying. Secondly, I only have a mere few days here and buying new toiletries wasn't on my itinerary. In fact, I don't even have time for it. Jetstar managed to screw my whole week up just because of their incompetence. It's not about the money I need to spend buying new things, it's the time that I don't have. Why should I have to suffer for their negligence. After calling them, which they clearly did not take me seriously, all the operator could say was ""we can't do anything"". The operator was unhelpful and snobbish. I am not after the compensation, I just wanted to know how they are able to help. Such cases have happened to me and I received my baggage within 24 hours (Singapore Airlines). I am now currently stuck in Cairns with nothing but a phone and a dying laptop and my whole trip ruined, while they insist on not providing any other help. Jetstar might have cheap ticket prices, but I assure you it is not worth ruining your trip for. The time I have to spend going around buying necessities could've been used for doing more productive things.",1
2016,"Flight on Christmas morning from Melbourne to Adelaide cancelled, just before checking in. Sydney flight same day also cancelled. Reason for both: sudden technical problems. Return flight, three days later from Adelaide, also cancelled an hour before departure. Reason: unexpected mechanical problems, again. Upon asking Adelaide staff about routine maintenance, we were told ""an aircraft is not serviced like a car, it can break down any time"".  Lost a day's wages as the offered return flight left the next day only.",1
2015,"We traveled twice with Jetstar in November 2015. Only complaint is that we'd selected seats on line, aisles across from each other. Once on the plane we seated and strapped in only to be told by a young couple who said those seats belonged to them, even though we had printed boarding passes with those seat numbers noted. Naturally we called a flight attendant over who ordered us out of the seats and gave them to that young couple. The flight attendant told us to move to a window and middle seat in the back of the plane. These days one does not argue with flight attendants or they throw you off the plane so we just gave in. We always try for aisle seats because of the ease of ingress and egress. Sure, we lived through it but it was not fun to be treated in a nasty manner by an employee of the airline we'd paid actual money to for services. The flight was ""dirt dog cheap"" so I guess we got what we paid for. Cheap price, cheap experience.",1
2015,"Jetstar Airways from Denpasar to Sydney. Web check in worked perfectly. Baggage drop was quite efficient. The aircraft was spacious and clean and bright, and economy class was comfortable with enough leg room. The flight departed Denpasar on time and arrived in Sydney a little earlier than scheduled. Flight attendants were friendly, food was tasty and plentiful but it would be nice to be served breakfast at 6am instead of dinner at 1am. IFE was available with limited free content. A very pleasant experience.",0
2015,"Once again, Jetstar did not disappoint. Returning to Hobart the same day, Jetstar's schedules and prices make a day trip pleasantly possible. Cabin crew were pleasant and performed their duties with smiles and conversation. The return flight was about 90 minutes delayed. I did not find this to be a problem, and I heard no complaints from other passengers. I have international flights booked with Jetstar, early in 2016. I am confident that they will be just as pleasant.",0
2015,"Flew Jetstar Airways, Newcastle to Gold Coast return. Both flights on time and cabin crew courteous and efficient. Only had carry on baggage, which I had no problem fitting in. Seat width and pitch is suitable for such a short flight. The lack of ability to select seats for free when online checking in is my only gripe.",0
2015,I booked a window seat going to Brisbane and an aisle seat to return to Sydney with Jetstar Airways. Strangely enough it was the same aircraft - VH VQA. Have to say window seat wins hands down for space and comfort. Cabin could have been cleaner as I found crumbs on my seat and the air seemed a bit stale. Magazines were well worn despite only being midway through the month and a previous passenger had left their boarding pass in the seat pocket from a few months ago. Check in queue was quite long but it moved along ok. However at Brisbane it was inconvenient that they did the handcarry size and weight check after check-in which meant queuing up 4 times before actually boarding and made worse with the lack of seats immediately at the gate because they put the flight next to several other minor routes instead of some priority spacing unlike other carriers had set up. Booking the flight through the Jetstar website was good. The interface was easy enough and the early check-in feature and early seat selection are big drawcards for me. I think its a great idea for the cabin crew to direct passengers to their seat because one of them omitted this on my flight down to Brisbane and it meant someone took my seat by mistake until I pointed this out to the cabin crew. The cabin crew were more diligent for the return flight for Sydney and they directed every one to the right seat.,0
2015,Appalling service. The flight from Christchurch to Auckland was cancelled. No pre-warning. This is the second time I have experienced this with Jetstar in one month. It's hard to be professional and get to a meeting in another city if you travel with Jetstar Airways. They offer a range of reduced price seats which tempts patrons to use their service. Price is irrelevant if the plane doesn't fly.,1
2015,"Jetstar Airways flight from Bali to Brisbane. Overnight so no real comment on cabin service. Flew business for a sleep on the trip. Check-in fine, walked into the business class cabin. First thing I said was ""I have flown in a lot of business class cabins and this is the worst I have ever seen, its no more than premium economy"". Food was poor quality, the same as other airlines economy class. Will not be flying Jetstar again.",1
2015,"Flew Jetstar Airways three times in the past six months. 1st failure on way to airport for flight to Cairns received sms to advise flight was cancelled with no way of re-booking flight and cursory response from counter person first available 10 hours later. 2nd failure flew out from Melbourne on December 2nd over two hours late. 3rd failure flew in from Gold Coast, December 8th over two hours late. Sorry Jetstar three strikes and you're out.",1
2015,"Brisbane to Honolulu via Sydney with Jetstar Airways. Schedule changes prior to flight which I wasnt notified about. Re-booked on flights which gave 35 mins to connect from domestic to international in SYD. 2 hours 10 minutes in the check-in line  no exaggeration. Then we were given seats 10 rows away from each other although we had paid to be together. We disputed this and eventually were assigned seats together. Once onboard people were in our seats and had same seat numbers printed on their boarding passes however they had not paid for their seat requests. Crew asked me ""if I really wanted to split up a family""? Boeing 787 made my throat very dry. Uncomfortable seats and armrests not padded. Toilet flushes while sitting on it. The filthy toilet seat closes on my back when I am sitting on the toilet. On return flight, toilet in the small cabin around row 12 was out of order and the cabin smelt terrible.  I asked for a cup of water and was handed a 1.5L bottle to pour myself whilst standing. Crew napping (dayflight 9 hours) and toilets were filthy. I could go on.",1
2015,"Cairns to Perth with Jetstar Airways. The customer service was ok, the cabin crew were amazing. My inflight entertainment wouldn't work properly. Angry that my luggage didn't make the flight from Cairns to Perth and on the way back my second bag can not be located! Not impressed at all.",0
2015,"Jetstar Airways service was amazing. Once I saw the cabin I knew this would be a good one. The seat was comfortable and the leg space was good enough. The food is excellent and the cabin service was great. However the airline should include in-flight entertainment to improve their status. Overall, it is a good airline.",0
2015,"A couple of warnings. Jetstar flies from Terminal 3 at Narita, the low cost terminal. The Narita Express train does not stop at this terminal, so you have to get off at the Terminal 2 stop and walk about 700m to the check-in area. Also, there is no Business Class lounge in Terminal 3. So there is much less point paying for a Jetstar BusinessMax fare (as I did), because there is no access to a lounge. This is not mentioned on the Jetstar website. They say Qantas lounge access ""where available"", but any reasonable person would assume that, as Narita is a huge airport that Qantas flies to, a Qantas lounge would be available. I felt a bit cheated. Anyway check-in and boarding were very smooth. Onboard the airline offers good value for money, with a comfortable seat (for day flying at least) and a reasonable food and drink offering. The crew on my flight were very solicitous and attentive. Overall Jetstar Business Class is an excellent product in its class (but investigate whether you can get value for the BusinessMax fare before buying!)",0
2015,"Worst experience ever. After reading many comments I realize that I am now one of many, but do yourself a favor and never fly Jetstar Airways no matter the price. Hidden fees plus no service plus lousy attitude. Admired to making lose our flight by their mistake and our compensation was not charging us extra to catch the next flight. Flew with them four times while in Australia and problems every time.",1
2015,"Melbourne to Bangkok return, and I have flown this route many times - it defies me how Jetstar never get this route on time. They are late to depart, and always the same reasons - late passengers (this is from the airline that invented strict check-in policies), the pilot completing paperwork etc etc. If you track the history of these flight numbers you will see that the average delay is 1 hr. If you look at on-time performance for this route, Thai airways comes in at 95%, Jetstar is around 27%. And to rub salt into the wound, Qantas closed their lounge in Bangkok on 15th November 2015 - so that $300 plus extra fee you pay to enjoy things like the lounge - worthless. They put you in a local airport lounge - but bear in mind anyone can use this at a cost of only $40 - far from worth it.",1
2015,"The worst thing about Jetstar is their website. The night before our flight, I decided to book exit row seats. I logged in, got to the seating map, and spent twenty minutes trying to allocate seats with no success. I then spent another fifteen minutes trying to locate a phone number on their website so I could speak with someone who could hopefully help me. I ended up going through Google to find a number, finally speaking with a very helpful man who booked my seats. Whilst online, though no seats had been booked, the website gave me the impression it had debited our credit card anyway, but the very helpful man assured me no money had been taken. Our flight the following morning was fine, if a little early for me (6.10am). Cabin crew were good, the pre-ordered toasted sandwich was hot and tasty, and flight departed on time and arrived early into Cairns. We always fly Qantas, but some routes in Australia are not flown by them, so other carriers such as Jetstar or Virgin have to be used. Jetstar is the preferred option as I can accrue Qantas FF points and status credits. This is my fifth domestic flight with Jetstar, and all flights have been on time and without incident.",0
2015,"I have flown short-haul on JetStar a few times - nothing exceptionally bad or good to comment on, but you kinda get what you pay for. However, this review is for a flight I didn't take, and where Jetstar outperformed expectations. I had to cancel my holiday due to serious illness in the family and Jetstar gave me a full refund for my tickets. Their customer service staff were helpful, compassionate and efficient - unexpected from a budget carrier.",0
2015,"Honolulu to Auckland via Sydney. Jetstar is the worst airline I have ever flown with. It started before the departure. We booked our flight and could not add pieces of luggage (Online). When we wanted to check in at the airport, the staff then explained we have to pay 101. Who travels for without any piece of luggage?  I already paid a lot of money for the flight. During the flight, we then realized that we do not get any food unless we buy an overpriced snack. Honestly, I pay for a flight (Honolulu to Sydney) and there is no single food offered?  Twice the flight attendant brought us 1 cup of water. Coffee should cost 3.50, in my opinion, even incomprehensible. Movies, music and other one had of course to pay for - as an example, you could buy (about 4 minutes length) for $5 music video. At the end I can say confidently that Jetstar is the worst airline ever, excuse my language.







Peace",1
2015,"Jetstar ruined our holiday. At 3.42 as I was riding home from work (I had left early for our 6:30 jetstar flight to Melbourne) and received a text message that said the flight from Sydney is cancelled. For options told to check email or call 131 538. No explanation, that was it. I rushed home to make the call. After going through all the call options, waiting for a long time (for which Jetstar apolozied but I was waiting and waiting). I was put through to a call centre. I provided all necessary details, again, and the overseas customer service lady tried to appear helpful by saying the cancellation was due to engineering difficulties and that she would try to put me on the partner airline Qantas to Melbourne. She asked me to wait so I waited - and waited for a very long time then, she hung up! Desperate to try to redeem the weekend I called again and went through the entire wait routine again. This time the lady informed that all flights were fully booked but if I could get out to Sydney airport in 8 minutes we may be able to catch the 5:30 flight! By this time it was 4:52 peak hour traffic time and although we live in Chifley, about 20 minutes to the airport with no traffic, this was totally impossible - it was Friday afternoon peak hour! While waiting and talking on the phone I had logged on to the internet to find that there were some available seats on Jetstar flights going to the alternate Melbourne airport, Avalon, same night. I asked if we could possibly be booked onto one of these flights as although it was very inconvenient we would still be able to arrive in Melbourne that night and join other family members who were already successfully travelling to Melbourne from various locations using other airlines. I was informed that if I did this I would have to pay for the flight again as it was not to the same airport and that I would not be refunded. I asked if I could speak to her manager and she said that was not possible, she would read out my options which were to cancel and apply for a refund through customer care which would take 15 days! or she could book me on a flight the next day, 12:45pm was the earliest - a night and day of our 2 day holiday ruined as we had to return to Sydney the next day Sunday at 6:30 pm. I explained and she said all I could do was present my case to customer care. I asked if she could put me through to ""customer care"" and she said she did not have a phone number for ""customer care"" and that I had to go online, email them and wait for them to examine my case (up to 15 days as above). Totally frustrated I asked again to talk to the manager. She said she would put me through to someone then left and again I waited for a long time. There was no response on the line so I called again same wait process and asked the woman not to hang up on me this third time and that I wanted to know if I took a flight that night on their partner airline would they refund me for the flight I had already paid for and pay the cost difference for the new flights, this cancellation being Jetstars eng. fault (there were still seats on these other flights). She could not tell me. I couldn't afford the additional fares so I had to ask her to book me on the 12:45 flight Saturday, only to have to return the next day. We missed out on important family time together. Jetstar you ruined our holiday!",1
2015,"Jetstar's Star Class isn't the height of luxury, but I was impressed by the great value for money it offers. Check-in was a breeze, and onboard the seat was broad and comfortable (for a day flight at least). The crew service was excellent, better than in many ""real business class cabins, there was welcoming bubbly and the meals were fine. The Dreamliner flight operated bang on time. I have a couple more flights booked in Jetstar Airways Star Class, and don't feel apprehensive about them now.",0
2015,"I have not had an on time with Jetstar over my last 5 flights. They wouldn't know what an on time flight was if it hit them in the face while walking around the runway trying to pick up the pieces of their reputation. Adding to that, they don't even inform you of a delay until you get to the airport - my 88 year old grandmother can send a text message, so surely someone at Jetstar knows how to work a phone.",1
2015,"Very bad experience overall! We were supposed to fly in the morning with Jetstar Airways from Auckland to Christchurch and our flight got canceled at the last minute when all passengers were at the gate. Then started the hassle of putting all passengers back on later flights. Lots of lines and time lost for finally being rebooked at 4pm, miss our campervan location in Christchurch and lose a complete day of our honeymoon. Very fun to spend 6 hours in Auckland airport by the way. The Jetstar staff was not friendly and never apologized about the situation. Just a very bad experience throughout the day!",1
2015,"My last 3 Jetstar Airways flights between Melbourne and Sydney have all been delayed by 90 minutes, 4 hours and 60 minutes and counting. I don't care how cheap fares are, because airlines are in the business of customer service irrespective of price. The apologies are not internalised as it appears Jetstar system doesn't work. Off to try another budget carrier",1
2015,"Business class on Jetstar's Boeing 787 dreamliner from Melbourne to Honolulu. In short, save your money. Business class on Jetstar is not worth it. Tiny cabin, only three rows, 2-3-2 configuration, which is shocking for business class. Narrow, cramped seats with minimal recline and a pretty useless footrest. Food was unimpressive. The crew was very friendly, which was the only plus. Jetstar is a budget airline targeting families and holiday makers, so it's not designed to cater for business travelers. Also, the flight was full of screaming babies, which made sleeping nearly impossible. Pick another airline or fly economy, which is a decent product for the price.",1
2015,"Auckland to Christchurch with Jetstar Airways, the first flight in the morning at 6.10 am ready for boarding and flight cancelled. First time in my life I have just been given us a fotocopy paper saying I am sorry, asked for compensation. They did not even put us on the next flight, only on the third one, and we were stranded 6 hours in the airport not even a meal voucher, when others had. Very bad, bad service.",1
2015,"Jetstar is a budget airline, which is why I generally avoid flying with them. But in this case did not even get on to the plane. It was cancelled due to ""crewing requirements"", according to e-mail sent to me two hours before the flight was due to leave. The plane had arrived in Darwin, and apparently left empty. As a result, I missed my international connection from Brisbane. When as suggested I contacted Jetstar by phone, I went through their voice recognition system which was aggravatingly useless, and ended up giving the same information that the useless computer system had requested to a live person in the Philippines. Fortunately my employer has a policy of never using Jetstar if an alternative is available so I have rebooked on another airline. Only good thing in all of this is that the Filipino on the other end of the phone was polite and did as much as they could given severe constraints on doing anything useful.",1
2015,"I am writing to express my frustration at Jetstar Airways online booking system for Special needs passengers. My mother is 91 years of age and we have travelled many times with Jetstar. My mother requires a wheelchair for each flight, however when I have booked on-line and requested a wheelchair, there is no warning that tells me that one is not available on that flight. It is not until I receive the email that the wheelchair symbol is missing. So I am left with a paid booking and no wheelchair. How simple it would be to have a warning whilst doing the booking to let me know to choose another flight time. This has caused my mother great distress.",0
2015,"9:00pm Jetstar Airways flight from Changi to Melbourne, first thing I noticed about the flight was that it was very cramped and the seats uncomfortable. Being on a saver fare, no food was included, but found the prices to be reasonable onboard - but water should be free. Flown Jetstar many times on domestic flights, but will not fly again on international as the comfort and service is not up to par compared to other budget airlines such as Scoot and AirAsia x.",1
2015,"Absolutely awful customer service and outlandish fees for baggage travelling with Jetstar Airways from Bali to Cairns. It's worth flying a more expensive airline as you will get massively overcharged for your bags with Jeststar, so it is not worth the savings. We were charged 570USD for 2 bags! That is twice the price of our tickets. Will never fly Jetstar Airways again and will certainly never suggest to anyone else. Very disappointing.",1
2015,Sydney to Ballina/Byron with Jetstar Airways. Check-in at Sydney was very slow. Arrived 1.5 hrs before flight still needed to hurry to gate. Only two check in counters open. Flight was excellent value - flight arrived ahead of schedule. Great crew - clean aircraft. Probably would have given it a 10 if it wasn't for the check in experience.,0
2015,"Flew Jetstar Airways to Bali a few months ago on the recommendation of a travel agent, and once again to Phuket last week. Never again ! Improvements must be implemented urgently. Cabin crew were noticeably inattentive, to the extent that rubbish piled up on tray tables. I asked for a blanket due to a sudden drop in cabin temperature but was told the airline did not carry any (despite) the seat in front of me being supplied with one. Worst of all - one of the cabin crew picked up a large bottle of water (in front of me), drank from that bottle and replaced it on the tray with other bottles - presumably for use with other guests. A health issue? Surely a very serious lapse of standard practices which management must address.",1
2015,"On a family holiday in Australia we chose Jetstar to fly from Sydney to Cairns. On arriving at Sydney T2 we found that we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the scheduled 15.20 departure. This meant trying to find somewhere to sit in a heavily overcrowded departure lounge while guarding our luggage. The preferred method of checking in seemed to be using one of a row of machines which very efficiently printed our boarding cards and luggage labels. But when we went to the ""Bag Drop"" we were told to wait at the back of the queue. I'm still not sure if everybody in front of us had already checked in at the machine or not. The Jetstar staff member at check-in weighed our 4 hold cases. We'd paid for four x 20 kgs, but all of them only came to 70 kgs. We knew we were allowed 7 kgs per person for hand luggage. When we were asked to redistribute 2 kgs. weight from one case into other pieces of hand luggage which were underweight, we were shocked. We were 10 kgs under on hold baggage! A little common sense would show that we'd already paid more than enough for extra luggage. We'd flown Tigerair from Melbourne to Sydney and their luggage policy seemed far more reasonable - same weight restrictions but as long as the total does not exceed your limit it doesn't matter how it is distributed. Onboard we had serious problems with fellow passengers. We were seated together 27C my wife, 27D myself, 27E my daughter's boyfriend and 27F my daughter. There were 7 men aged 28-35ish seated 25C,D,E,F and 26D,E and F. They were very boisterous from the start, shouting and swearing at each other. Then they ordered beers repeatedly until one of the attendants refused to serve them more alcohol. They became more rowdy and then the one in 26F dropped a can of beer which rolled against my daughter's handbag. When she drew his attention to this they rounded on her giving her ""the finger"". I told them to be careful and they called me a ""rat"". The attendant came and asked them to calm down but it was having no effect. The ringleader appeared to be in 25F. He pressed the call button and told the attendant that I was annoying him by ""reading too loud"" he could ""hear my thoughts"". He looked at me and put his forked fingers to his eyes and then pointed them at me, in true Hollywood gangster style! I felt threatened and concerned for my family's well being. I was worried that they'd all come up to us at the baggage claim. As it happened the only thing was that 25F ran past and bumped into my arm on purpose. I feel the cabin crew allowed this situation to escalate. The entire rear of the plane had to put up with this childish behaviour for three hours. They even shouted at infants to 'Shush"". The staff should have threatened them with calling ahead to Cairns Airport Police to be waiting. This may have served to quieten them down.  Why can't Jetstar allow check-in earlier than 2 hours? I know I have done it with other airlines and it cuts down the queuing tremendously. Why don't Jetstar adopt a total weight luggage policy and show clearly if baggage drop is operational? Why didn't Jetstar cabin crew take sterner action with these 7 troublemakers?",1
2015,"On checking in for my Jetstar Airways flight at Cairns, the check-in terminal wouldn't accept my booking reference and said to go to the service counter. When I got there the lady behind the desk took ages to serve me. When I said that I needed to check in she said that I had to use the kiosk. I explained that it wasn't working and she said that I would have to line up in the regular check in lane with everyone else. I told her I had no hold luggage and she then insisted on looking at my carry on bag and weighing it. It was 300g over the 7kg limit and said I'd have to pay and check it in. Throughout she was rude and surly. When she dealt with my friend (a non-native English speaker) she treated him as a second class citizen. This was the first time in about 3 years that I used Jetstar because I'd had such a horrid experience with them flying from Gold Coast airport to Sydney and swore to myself never to use them again.",1
2015,We were made to stop for an additional bag check after doing through the standard immigration and international security. This was just before take off whilst waiting for boarding. They took away my water I had just purchased and food. I've never had this check done before and I would say it is almost certainly to make you buy something on the plane. This is forcing you to buy through them which surely is against certain rules / processes.,1
2015,"You only get what you pay for and this is the case with Jetstar, but at 2/3 the price of Qantas or Hawaiian, it makes for a cheaper alternative.  I've flown both and it's not much different between them all in economy. Service was better on return flight with the cabin staff more attentive. Food was pre booked and not bad but the breakfast on return was inedible. The Boeing 787 could be an awesome plane but with the very tight layout it makes the isles so tight that the trolleys hit seating, and this can be seen with gouges out of the seating. Watching the cabin crew try and work in those tight conditions should be an occupation hazard. The seating was comfortable, entertainment was a little light but ok for 9 hrs. Overall this is not a bad product for the price we paid.",0
2015,I passed out for hour due to lack of oxygen an hour into the flight. I can't think the Jetstar Airways crew enough for helping me. They were like nurses and I commend them for their professionalism.,0
2015,"Return flights from Tokyo to Cairns were both very impressive. Flights were not crowded, which always helps, but found these nice new dreamliner aircraft to be very comfortable. Service was excellent, both friendly and efficient. I had not pre-purchased food or drinks, in fact, took my own food. But found a very good selection of both drinks and snacks available for purchase on the aircraft. Both flights departed right on time, and arrived a little early. All in all, and excellent experience.",0
2015,"Standard red-eye Adelaide-Melbourne flight. Chose the starter plus option upon booking for $30 extra, which allows for several extras, including a $5 voucher to use during cabin service. Crew were very friendly and attentive, and overall a fantastic 58-minute flight.",0

2015,"Scheduled to fly on jetstar at 1.30pm to the Gold Coast for a wedding. Left my work early, flight was cancelled with no other Jetstar flight to board. We had to be placed on a Virgin flight at 6.45pm that evening. Missed out on family gathering. No explanation from jetstar as to what happened. Melbourne is the second biggest city in Australia and Jetstar can't get there act together.",1
2015,"I flew HNL-SYD and a month later SYD-HNL. I was actually traveling from Vancouver to SYD, and broke up the trip by flying Air Canada YVR-HNL return for about $550, and the Jetstar for about $1100 (plus all the extras). I had to stay one night in HNL each way, adding $500 hotel. With the Jetstar extras the cost perhaps $500 less than a direct flight. Plus I was trying to break up the 15/16 hour nonstop flight duration.  Jetstar : I had a cordial reception checking in at HNL. The rest of the staff throughout the rest of the trip were indifferent. The Boeing 787 is a nice airplane, as they go. I paid extra for a good seat, which was a great boon on full flights. That was good value for money. I paid $40-ish for the meal: it was a rude joke both times. The meal was mushy, minimal and miserable, and you needed to wait 15 minutes for a drink to wash it down. The most demeaning part of the experience was getting dinged $125 for my 5 kilos overweight baggage on my return. There wasn't a weight scale where I was staying, so I couldn't have prepared myself for the problem. My carry-on backpack was at the carry-on weight limit, so I couldn't switch items into that. So it was either pay the money or toss out some of my clothes. I paid, and then fumed for the next hour or two. The only way Jetstar can avoid this kind of rude greeting for a customer would be to give staff some leeway on the overweight rule. But they were very stern. In most of the reviews people are willing to forgive Jetstar's faults because of the lower prices. I don't agree. A price is a price and a fault is a fault. If Jetstar worked on its faults, and upped its prices slightly, it could delight customers instead of annoying them, as it so often does. I think I'll flight direct next time, either Qantas or Air Canada.",1
2015,"Jetstar insist frequently enough during the online ticket purchase process that passengers must get to the airport 2 hours prior to departure which we dutifully did, arriving at Melbourne airport a bit before 4 am, to catch the 6:05 am jetstar flight to Sydney. When we arrived check in had just opened and there were only 2 staff checking baggage. Got our baggage tag and got in the queue. Then they proceeded to call out every single passenger whose flight were departing before ours, regardless of where they were in the queue. At one point the front line stood still for more than 49 minutes whilst jet star personnel were pulling people out of the other lanes and getting them checked in. When we finally got seen - after a riot nearly broke out - the check in guy told us we had less than 5 minutes to get through security and make our flight. We had to run like mad. Our flight was at 6:05 am!  I don't care about the pay per use for extra stuff like bags, food, seat assignments etc - it's a nuisance but fine. I'll pay, as long as I get the service. The lack of a coordinated path to check baggage for passengers and poor organization at the airport is simply not acceptable and no cheap airfare makes this worth the anxiety! It is maddening and made me angry and resentful. I can't believe this airline is a Qantas offshoot. In the end don't bother with the 2 hours early part. It does not make any difference trust me!! At least not for domestic flights departing Melbourne. Get there 45 minutes before your flight, flag a staff member and tell them your flight is boarding now and you'll get right up the front of the queue and wave bye bye to the poor sops who play by the rules. Basic definitions of service do not apply here and it is NOT first come first serve as they claim. It is next flight out gets first priority, which makes for a highly stressful experience. Definitely not worth the aggravation from my personal experience.",1
2015,"First time flying Jetstar International, were flying from OOL (Gold Coast) to Wellington. Have heard some pretty average reviews with Jetstar for a little while. Considering Gold Coast to Wellington is a new route for Jetstar I was expecting a fair bit of turning in the air. We had also flew Wellington to Gold Coast when we were coming to Gold Coast, surprisingly we had the same Head Pilot for both flights, very friendly! Around 1/2 way through the flight the food cart came around, we were quite lucky because they told us each and every one in our family had $10 vouchers. In the end we couldn't even spend $40 on food! Staff were really friendly and was a beautiful day to travel. We landed in Wellington 30 minutes early.",0
2015,"We were checked in at flight GK109 from Tokyo to Sapporo. 15 minutes before boarding time we recognized some problems because Japanese passengers were discussing something with Jetstar airline staff heavily. No one spoke English but I understood the word 'canceled'. I asked for a manager to come, but they say we had to go to the check-in hall again for check-out. To make the story short no assistance, no information, no help was provided. I understand this is cheap airline but also the worst, try Air Asia which has excellent staff and organization for comparison.",1
2015,"Business Class with a budget carrier, but you would hardly have noticed with the excellent customer service. Champagne before take-off with a follow up choice of drinks. The meal range was quite good and the food was barely recognisable as airline food. The seats were certainly comfortable enough. The only downsides I could think of was a lack of available movies to watch and there was no priority boarding. Other than these small issues, the flight was a credit to the airline.",0
2015,"About 6 years ago I swore never to fly on Jetstar again, unfortunately urgent circumstances required my family and I to fly from Auckland to Wellington NZ. Normally we would have taken an Air New Zealand flight, but flights all full and we had a time dealing to get to Wellington. Cramped seating, and sub standard service from start to finish pretty much sums up this awful excuse for an airline. Qantas must be ashamed to have an association Jetstar. We get to Wellington and in a rush to make a function and in true Jetstar form, no bags arrive off the conveyor. After almost 20 minutes and about 40 plus customers all standing about awaiting bags, several customers like myself started making approaches to Jetstar. Apparently the machine that unloads luggage from the plane is broken and they didn't have another. Made worse because they were too cheap to hire one from Air NZ to get the plane unloaded. 50 minutes later customers were starting a small riot wanting to know what was going on. Jetstar never made any PA announcements, nor did they apologise when we finally got luggage 1.25 hours after the flight landed. They aren't a cheap airline to fly on anyway. By the time you buy a ticket, then a meal, pay extra for a bag etc, you could have purchased an economy ticket on another airline and had all the extras for free and excellent service.",1
2015,"Pleasantly surprised, enjoyed the flight. New plane, great crew, full flight. This flight is only 2.5 hours and leaves Darwin at 1.30pm getting into Cairns at 4.30. Pre-ordered meals, fish and chips and toasted sandwich, food was fine and ordered a couple of wines. Scored vouchers also, plus Qantas points and status credits. Flight was on time and check-in at Darwin was fairly quick. Have used Qantas on this route, but Jetsar better with daytime flight. Able to use Qantas Club beforehand, handy for a drink before flight. Have since been on this flight again, will review later.",0
2015,"Jetstar offer a very poor service, even in their so called business class. The seating is cramped with the seat in front reclining right in your lap and the drinks service very poor with one glass of wine with your meal and thats it, I was not offered a top up at all. Inflight entertainment was poor with a selection of about 8 watchable movies and some TV shows, overall the entertainment was very ordinary. I would not fly this airline again considering the poor service and seating. There are other choices on this route in business class for around the same price.",1
2015,Firstly they did not serve drinks prior (or even with) the meal - this service took place after dinner. Secondly they took so long to clear the dinner service that passengers were taking their trays to the galley themselves and stacking them in piles! Inflight entertainment is very expensive. Seats very uncomfortable and did not recline back far enough to be comfortable and allow sleep.,1
2015,"My first and last flight with Jetstar JQ30. After security at Bangkok I purchased water in departures just before boarding, but was taken off me when boarding as I was told water was not allowed on this flight. I was assured plenty would be available in flight. After take off I requested water to and was presented with a tiny bottle of water and asked for four dollars. I purchased six of these during the flight. In all my years of flying i have never experienced this. I have flown Ryanair around Europe and have no qualms with a budget flight on short haul of a few hours but never imagined this scenario on a 9 hour long haul. I will not fly Jetstar again. Perhaps my fault for not checking out Jetstar before booking.",1
2015,"Service was good by the attendants. MEL-SIN legs IPads had enough content for an 8 hour flight. I prefer these as they come with noise cancelling headphones and better quality than seat back entertainment. Food was hit and miss but didn't go hungry. Seats are ok for day flight but struggled to get comfortable for the return night flight. I have to agree with other reviews in regards to space between seats. If you are seated against a window or middle seat, you will struggle for space once the people in front of you recline. Also on one leg there was gaffer tape used on one seat. Not a good look SIN-SGN return. Return flight was delayed but overall was a good experience. If you can get business on Jestar at a good price go for it, otherwise save your money.",0
2015,"JQ828/JQ907, Brisbane to Townsville return. Reading the reviews here, I was worried about Jetstar cancelling flights etc, but the fares were so good, I decided to take the risk. Both flights departed late, no explanation offered, but made up the time during the flights. Otherwise, everything went well. Very new planes. Seats were okay. FAs very impersonal, but got their job done. Overall, good flights. For the ticket prices, I was satisfied.",0
2015,"JQ30 on 16th June was my first flight on the new Dreamliner. In row 2 of Business Class, I had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. There is an inherent design problem with JQ's configuration: Row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts Row 2 seats' access and space. When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms. The food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 Business Class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front. I will not use this service to SEAsia again as Economy with carriers like Cathay is far more comfortable and better value.",1
2015,I flew round trip HNL-SYD in June on Jetstars 787 Dreamliner. Both flights were on time and found the plane very comfortable. I would recommend pre ordering your food. The flight crew only came through the cabin 3 times in a 10 hour flight. First serving pre order breakfast followed by beverage service. Five hours later for pre order lunch followed by snacks or lunch for purchase(if they had enough). Finally 1.5 hours prior to landing for pre order snakes and beverage service. I would also use Web Checkin and look for that queue at the airport. Overall very happy with Jetstar considering their low rates.,0
2015,"I know Jetstar business class is not really business class but we have used it frequently to fly to Thailand and Singapore and when it was Starclass it was good. This last trip will be my last, I did not enjoy it at all. My husband and I did not sleep a wink as the seats were just too uncomfortable. I fail to see why we should pay the same price as row 1 passengers (we were row 2), when we have nowhere near the amount of legroom as row 1. Service was very average and I believe if you choose and pay for exit row seats with a premier airline in economy, it may be cheaper and more pleasant. Sad to see the service decline as it used to be a reasonable option. From now on, it's either true business class with a better airline, or we just don't go!",1
2015,"Booked Jetstar 3 times and flight cancelled 2 times! My flight was first being rescheduled to the later time of 4am. After checking, the flight was cancelled and I was only informed via SMS just 3 hours before departure. I was already on the way to airport and it was midnight. No more Jetstar.",1
2015,"Flight left Brisbane around 45 minutes late, but arrived ahead of schedule. The only reviews where people complain are the ones who don't pre-book meals, entertainment etc. We had added bags, meals, entertainment and comfort packs when booking and it was like flying a full service airline. We paid for 2 people return what 1 person would cost on Hawaiian Airlines so cannot complain. Jetstar are not a terrible airline you just get what you pay for.",0
2015,Flew Hobart to Melbourne then to Phuket and back again in May 2015. Never again will we use them. From check in to the cramped seating to the appalling lack of service from rude cabin staff is just plain terrible. There was no meal offered on the Melbourne to Phuket leg or on the return leg. This is just not good enough. We also found the Dreamliner aircraft very noisy. Never again.,1
2015,"We will not fly with Jetstar again. At Perth airport on June 4th there was some sort of alarm telling wardens to report to their stations which ran for about 30 minutes, at no time did Jetstar staff make an announcement saying everything is okay, sorry that your flight is now delayed. There was some mumbled apology from pilot but overall we got 3 different reasons for all delays. Return flight 12th June - No notice received by us or our friends (who were not booked all together) that our 7.30 am flight was delayed until 4.40 pm - there was a message from 10.30 pm the night before which we got on landing in Australia. We had chosen email as preferred mode of contact as we did not have mobile access in Bali, but no email received to date. When we got to the airport our flight was the only one with no boarding gate listed for a couple of hours until about 30 minutes before flight, we watched the plane landing then we got a gate. Again we were delayed with no reasons given and got back to Australia at about 9.30 pm. There was no hot food available on the flight except noodles! I am sure they will have excuses but not communicating with us at any time is poor practice and many on the flight had same complaints and said never again on Jetstar.",1
2015,"Spent 13hrs at Bali airport before being advised flight is cancelled. Unable to find anyone to speak with from Jetstar. Finally get a flight 28hrs after original flight. Advised by captain what had happened, better late than never. Hot beverages, no they are cold beverages. Look at the picture of the coffee on the menu as to what is actually served. Flight crew, some lessons in responsible serving of alcohol are needed. Seat comfort, my arm rest was taped up with duct tape.",1
2015,"Our flight from Sydney to Honolulu was cancelled after standing in line for 3 hrs. Tired frustrated customers then had to be insulted by the Jetstar spokesman who simply kept reiterating that any costs involved in missed forward flights, accommodation etc were our fault if we had not taken out travel insurance  he likened it to hiring a car. I researched 5 different travel insurance providers and none would insure against an airline cancelling their own flight only against weather. Jetstar did not reply to my query as to whether our flight was cancelled due to engineering problems and if so why wasnt another aircraft provided or due to an unfilled flight which several passengers had been told was the reason. Jetstar did offer $60 vouchers with an expiry date of 6 months  I asked if these could be transferred or extended as we did not intend to travel in that period and of course the response was no. The cancelled flight caused many passengers grief, in our case it set the stage for a nightmare 5 days of missed ongoing flights with huge rebooking fees (being Easter it was a nightmare getting seats on flights), missed hire car bookings, missed hotel and car hire, lost luggage meaning the same clothes for 5 days. Jetstar customer service responded that 'Section 9.1 of our Conditions of Carriage does state that flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us. This information is available on our website and you agree to it when you make your booking.' Jetstar is not a cheap airline, in fact there are times it is more expensive than Qantas and Virgin  we booked Jetstar because it fitted in with our dates. United Airlines and Delta Airlines were both involved in our 5 missed flights and both were amazingly helpful in getting us from Honolulu to New York and even changed our flight for the second time without charge  why cant Jetstar treat its passengers with the same consideration. Jetstar get into the real world and offer your customers service and if you mess up make it right, your customers should not have to be out of pocket for your mistake.",1
2015,Travel MEL-BKK on Jetstar business class approx every year.  I don't think of it as business class but more as premium economy and for the price I think we get a good deal.  It shouldn't really be called business class as it in no way compares to business class. Good food and drinks and very good customer service.  We wouldn't use the service annually if we were not happy but business class is only used for longer haul flights when we travel with other airlines.,0
2015,Adelaide to Melbourne JQ771 27/2. I'm lucky because I get to depart each Jetstar flight from Adelaide Airport. With 7 departures taken in 6 months using Jetstar I have never had reason to complain about anything. The staff are professional and the pilot always makes clear and informative announcements. I take a comfy rubber mat for additional comfort for longer domestic trips.,0
2015,Travelled May 7th Honolulu-Melbourne JQ2 in economy class. Paid +$700 for a one way ticket no food no entertainment no service basically. Was seated on seat 41A armrest between seats was held together by sticky tape. Seats were the most uncomfortable I've ever traveled on. Cabin crew was on the verge of rude and indifferent. Toilets very dirty. The flight was delayed by 3 hrs! Trying really hard to find a positive here but unfortunately nothing positive bout the whole experience. Back to Hawaiian Airlines for sure!,1
2015,We've just come back from a trip to Vietnam where we had two flights booked with Jetstar. I have to say that our overall experience was very frustrating. The time of our first flight - Hanoi to Da Nang was moved from 9.15am to 7am with 11 days notice. Our second flight - Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh was changed from 5.15pm to 10.55am - we managed to contact Jetstar and be moved to the 6.15pm flight. However the departure of this flight was then changed to 8.55pm we received an email notifying us of this 2 days before the flight however many people we met at the airport did not receive any notification. Then on arrival at the airport we found that the flight had now been delayed to 10.15pm. With other airlines when we have experienced changes and delays we have always been offered either compensation or drinks / food vouchers at the airport - not the case with Jetstar!,1
2015,We flew Honolulu to Brisbane on May 21st the flight left on time Business class cabin was full but very comfortable. Service with a smile from a young energetic flight crew. The flight was seamless the food was served well and hot totally edible. Seats were very comfortable not massive legroom but ample toilets were kept clean and fresh we arrived on time in Brisbane. It may not compare to some other Business Class offered on other airlines however for us it was value for money and we travelled in comfort the daylight flight did not cause us to have bad jetlag we would surely fly with them again on this route. Your only grumble could be the inflight entertainment which could be clumsy when eating I chose to read and sleep.,0
2015,Perth - Singapore Flt 4K132. Departure times changed by Jetstar multiple times due to 'bad weather'. From original 10.40pm to 11.40pm to following morning 08.00am to 2pm. When at Gate for the 2pm departure told flight cancelled due to crewing problems. Taken on coach from international terminal to domestic terminal to reclaim baggage. After 20-30 minutes waiting for baggage to arrive on carousel told to return for 2am flight or offered option to cancel. A terrible experience.,1
2015,12 hour delay Perth to Singapore due to weather notified 24 hours before flight even left. All other airlines ran on time and reported no serious issues with weather. Rang Jetstar to ask for alternative flight after fighting the automated voice recognition system for 15 mins was forwarded to customer service. They gave us the run around and said something along the lines of can't control the weather and there may be more delays. A friend in Singapore said rain no worse than usual this time of year. I think it has to do with old technology used on the airplanes so cannot navigate in rain or fog.,1
2015,Read review by L Stephens 27 April and it reads the same as what happened to me. Flight 3K131 Singapore Perth 3 June 1755. Flight delayed then cancelled rescheduled to next morning 4 Jun 4.45am. Given $13 food voucher. So spent 12 hours wandering and pondering at Changi Airport. Weather was excuse which is a very common cop out used by them as they delay and cancel on a regular basis. I know they are a no frills budget airline but they are gradually loosing support because they are unreliable. I have flown with them previously and found them good. Best budget airline is Southwest Air in the US.,1
2015,Brisbane to Proserpine 17 Apr QF5830 and Proserpine to Brisbane May 19 QF5833. No delays great staff on the ground and onboard. The price of the flight was very competitive and right from the start I was helped by staff at Brisbane I had a boxed cycle with me which was cumbersome and awkward it arrived in perfect condition both ways especially as I hadn't paid any extra for fragile freight. I would recommend.,0
2015,787 MEL-DPS late afternoon flight. Departed on time. Staff very friendly. Plane clean. Seats comfortable for the 5 to 6 hour flight. Plane smooth and quiet. Pre-ordered food tasty. Drink service a little slow. It is a plane load of Aussies going to Bali so demand was high. To be expected. Melbourne airport check in very easy with the new bag drop. Arrived a bit early. Overall all great.,0
2015,16/5/15 JQ785 ADL-MEL Airbus A320. Again another very good flight with Jetstar. Welcomed aboard by friendly and helpful cabin crew. Flight attendants looked professional and lovely. Nice uniforms. Excellent professional conduct by cabin crew. Aircraft was clean. We had seat 17E & 17D seats were comfortable. Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags. I have not come across this on a Jetstar flight in the past. Overall a very good flight and this is a very good low cost carrier. Would recommend to others but will warn them of these new changes.,0
2015,JQ3 10 May. We travelled SYD-HON on Sunday 10 May in Business class. Apart from Jetstar's normal rubbish administration (cancelled our original flight and seemed to think that putting us on a flight two days earlier should not even worth discussing) everything else was good. To put it in perspective - you get what you pay for. Sure we could have gone QANTAS or Hawaiian and had better seats but that would have been 3 times the price. We could have gone economy but I'm well over 6 feet and didn't fancy that. So it was a good compromise. It cost us around $1000 each one way (we were getting the ship back) The seats were pretty good (about Premium Economy level) the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent. We would do it again (unless there was a special offer from QANTAS or Hawaiian.,0
2015,"Melbourne via Gold Coast to Narita. 29th March. Departed Melb at 6.10am and had a four hour wait at Coolangatta airport. Attempted to change the domestic flight to the day before but was told ""this flight is booked as a single booking and can't be changed"". So we assumed our luggage would be checked through from Melb. No had to collect luggage and check in again. Not a big deal but we fail to see why we could not change our domestic flight. The flights were good. Gold Coast to Narita was flight was excellent. The crew was excellent. Very attentive always had a smile. When you fly with a happy crew it does make a difference. Food and beverages were of a good standard. Flying on the 787 was fantastic. The only real negative is no priority luggage collection for Business Class. Can't be that difficult to do.",0
2015,SYD-MEL return into Avalon and out of Tullamarine. Jetstar do what they say on the box. I didn't expect a full service IFE or the best legroom on an A320. I hoped for on-time performance no cancellations a professional crew and they delivered. First flight was punctual the second experienced a weather-related delay that was handled well both before and during the flight with regular announcements. For the fare I was very satisfied and would use JQ again.,0
2015,"Jetstar ""Star Class"" is not worth it. Flew to Honolulu with Jetstar for holidays the tickets were not cheap but I think it was more premium economy at business class prices. No priority boarding. No priority baggage first off and last to get baggage. The all Thai cabin crew did not seem to have been well trained they were very friendly but the service was slow and haphazard. Some meals came out fast others really slow to arrive dessert of ice cream was liquid when it finally arrived. Food would be classed as average for economy on most airlines definately not what I would call ""business class"". Seats were not that comfortable and had lacked in legroom the seat in front hit my knees when reclined. Inflight entertainment of iPad took an hour to come out after departure and there was no place to hang it it was in my lap while I ate meal over the top of it. Not exactly classy. It was three times the price of an economy ticket and definitely not worth it. I am one very unhappy customer and will never fly Jetstar again.",1
2015,Flew SIN to PER last week. As it was an evening flight we checked the Jetstar website throughout the day to ensure that our flight was not delayed before heading to the airport. On arrival at 3.30pm we were told the flight had been delayed until 4.00am. The reason was fog over Perth however we watched as other reputable airlines departed as scheduled. We were each given 'meal' vouchers which turned out to be to the value of approx. $7.15 - not enough to purchase a meal from any of the airport vendors. When we approached Jetstar for further compensation they did not provide any. We were forced to spend 12 hours waiting in Changi airport watching time pass. When the flight eventually did depart (after 4am following a long delay on the Tarmac) we were then brought the dinner meals that had been pre-purchased when we believed we would be flying out in the evening! Not being interested in eating dinner at 6.30am this was further money wasted. The small amount of money saved by booking this budget airline was not in the slightest bit worthwhile and I would never fly with Jetstar again.,1
2015,Jetstar are the worst company I have flown with. We are on our honeymoon in Vietnam and I decided to book with Jetstar Pacific because I viewed them as a more reliable alternative to the other economy airlines in the region and also because of the flight times. However they have been completely disastrous changing the days and times of all our flights (some on multiple occasions) up to 2 days before the flight. This has meant we have had to completely change plans cancelling hotel bookings as well as all the stress that goes with it. I will never fly with them again.,1
2015,ADL-DPS-MEL. Bought Jetstar tickets through Qantas as it was seemingly the only way to get sensible domestic connection from CBR. Price was nothing special. Bags were bang on 20kg if not a whisker over but a blind eye was shown which was a relief. They didn't weigh hand luggage at the gate. ADL-DPS sector was on a domestic A320 which was old dirty and the magazines in our seats were all torn. The seats were either developed by a bus builder or just stuffed judging by our numb behinds for the 5-hour flight. Crew fine and I gather ADL based. Disappointingly half the menu was unavailable as tragic as the choices are - they really aren't trying it really is lowest common denominator and undrinkable wine. DPS-MEL sector was on new B787 with Australian pilots but all Thai flight attendants. New Denpasar Airport is excellent very efficient even if the air con is a bit changeable. You can buy duty free (unlike other ports in Asia on flights to Aus?) which is bagged and given to you at the gate. First time on 787 and the big windows and nicer cabin humidity/pressure seemed to make a difference. I got a good sleep couldn't complain too much about seat or pitch. I would do short haul 787 with Jetstar for the right price I again but keep my underlying disdain for this business model and airline.,1
2015,Recently spent a week in Tasmania and traveled to and from Hobart on Jetstar Australia. I have to put my hand up and admit that my wife and I have only traveled with Jetstar once some years ago. From the outset (booking your tickets) the experience was horrendous with each separate step being asked if we wish to purchase an add on. And the number of times where we were reminded that carry on luggage that breached the weight limits (which apparently have recently been reduced) would be severely penalised and baggage placed in the hold. On our flight to Hobart passengers were called to board the aircraft then spent 20 minutes in a holding pen waiting to board. The flight left 20 minutes late. On our return journey from Hobart we arrived at the recommended 60 minutes before departure time to be told that the plane had been delayed and would be an hour late arriving which eventuality extended to two hours late arriving and departing. The cabin crew were actually OK. Not overly friendly but courteous and attentive. Overall our latest experience with Jetstar was not one that I don't intend to repeat too soon. I will pay extra for a full service airline.,1
2015,"Jetstar canceled my flight from Melbourne to Newcastle Sun 19/04 because ""Melbourne Airport required maintenance on the plane"". Jetstar could not get us on a flight today but they say tomorrow Monday. I'm waiting and hoping for no more nasty surprises.",1
2015,Recently flew to Wellington from Auckland. The first thing I noticed was the metal bar sticking into my back from inside the seat. This made the flight a bit unpleasant during takeoff turbulence and landing. Cabin crew were very good. They let us view the flight deck after we had stopped at the gate. I'll give jetstar that their prices a very low compared to their only competition Air NZ. Would recommend jetstar for domestic flights but maybe not for International (on A320). If you like a nice seat that you can sit back and relax in then Jetstar might not be for you.,0
2015,11 April 2015 Departed HCM to Da Nang. The bus to the aircraft was full but plenty of wiggle room. The aircraft departed on-time everything worked and the crew was friendly and helpful. I was seated in the emergency exit room and it was great with plenty of leg room. Great price appeox. $41 USD. Next trip with them is 15 April from Da Nang to Hanoi. Will post results.,0
2015,I booked a return ticket from Adelaide to Sydney. Flight delayed nine hours. Check in took two hours and the staff were rude and unprofessional (one was even eating lunch while checking people in). Plane was not cleaned before departure - the dirtiest plane I've seen. Then the flight attendant failed to notice that the pax in front of me had his seat reclined before departure was left there for take off and for landing. No apologies - nothing. Never again. Very disappointing.,1
2015,I was excited to fly on Jetstar from SYD to HNL 787 but I didn't expect attitude from the attendants. There was a feeling from them that we are better than you are. A no frills airline should still staff it's planes with attendants that serve with dignity and grace. I felt that almost each time I addressed an employee the response was that I was being talked down to. I got that feeling and deplaned with disappointment.,1
2015,I booked a flight from Bali to Melbourne with a stopover at Darwin. The return flight was delayed by 3 hours thus I would miss my connecting flight in Darwin. At the airport they refused to tell me what replacement flight would be available. They gave me a number to call which was invalid. Had to call the Australian customer service and they kept insisting that I somehow get through immigration in 15 minutes to catch the connecting flight and they couldn't give me a replacement or to talk to the staff at the airport (there is no Jetstar staff at Bali airport just some other company staff that issues the boarding passes). After all the trouble they put me on a flight to Sydney which would connect to Melbourne but I had to spend 9 hours at Bali airport and miss work. If anyone wants to get anywhere on time and without any hassle then definitely avoid Jetstar.,1
2015,Early morning flight JQ823 March 4th was our first trip with Jetstar to Sydney. Check in was very quick and easy we have web checked in so just baggage drop and pick up the boarding passes. We were there nice and early to make sure we were on our flight. Boarding was on time and it was quick and efficient. Plane was nice and clean looked quite new. Seating is what I expected nice leg room and comfortable also. I was a little disappointed when it came to the prices of food. It was like $10 for a pie and drink. Drink at $3.50 was a bit pricey maybe $2.50 would have been acceptable but this is what you get for a low cost airline. We arrived in Sydney on time. Boarding off the aircraft was quick and efficient. No complaints on this leg and pick up of luggage as expected.,0
2015,We flew Tulla to Bali and return the new 787 is a nice aircraft seats were good. We paid a lot of money for these flights due to school holidays and Easter ($2487 for two adults). To say they give you nothing other than your seat is very true you pay for everything else!! A pillow and blanket is $10!! I purchased meals online prior to trip which cost another $60 and for movies each way another $40. Luggage took over 45 minutes to be unloaded when we returned to Melb. Would not fly with them again unless it was very cheap just like their service. Can't believe Qantas own this very budget airline. Hate to say this but next time it will be with Garuda who supply a full service.,1
2015,"Cheap and nasty sums up this airline. Flew Denpasar to Adelaide and as soon as I joined the check-in lines I was glad I'd booked my return trip on Virgin Australia. Queues at check-in were horrendous and the Melbourne flight had been cancelled so many of that flight's passengers were shifted onto the Adelaide flight. On board people can't pay cash for food and drink which seems ridiculous especially if they aim to save time. I was sat in the middle of the plane and they took over an hour to reach me and by the time they got to me they'd run out. When I asked for a fourth beer they stopped serving me because I'd ""had enough"" which is ridiculous given a) I was paying for it b) even a teetotaler wouldn't get intoxicated on four small cans of beer and c) their service had been lousy. If I go back to Adelaide next year I think I'll pay a premium to go with Singapore Airlines from Surabaya where I live even if I do have to backtrack and add 2 hours onto my journey because one doesn't get all these annoyances on full-service airlines that you get on these budget carriers.",1
2015,"I flew from Sydney to Bali. The seats are uncomfortable the inflight entertainment screen was too close and of a poor selection the seating / leg room was uncomfortably small (I am only 62 kgs and 1.67 tall ). On flight back from Bali to Sydney the air con was blowing icy cold air onto my neck and when I requested a blanket I was told that I did not choose the ""pamper Pack"" at $10 I did not want pampering but just protect myself from this cold blast. Too much take and no give with this airline. The cabin crew were not accommodating at all. I do fly to Bali once or twice a year and this was my first JetStar flight to that destination never again. They are ok for short flights within Australia but do not have the class for passengers to endure a longer trip.",1
2015,I flew to Bali from Sydney for $88 on 23 April 2015. The flight left 10 minutes late and arrived 33 minutes early. The plane was the new Boeing Dreamliner and I managed to secure a window seat without paying extra. This new plane had sufficient leg room and seat width for me. I am 178 cm tall and weigh 96 kg. The earphones plug into the back of the headrest in front of you. There is also a USB socket next to the earphones jack. The windows of this plane darken gradually but there is a button underneath the window to lighten them. For the first time the Jetstar ground staff did not ask to see a ticket out of Indonesia even though I was not flying out of Indonesia with Jetstar. I only took a cabin bag which weighed 9.7 kg. The Jetstar ground staff let the bag through as I had purchased the ticket in October. Nowadays Jetstar only allows a maximum of 7 kg for cabin luggage. Onboard I purchased a red wine cheese and crackers package for $A10. Overall a very pleasant flight.,0
2015,I have just traveled Jetstar return Perth to Cairns Australia. Even for a sometimes cheap airline the planes are made for cheap travel. The seats are very thin hard plastic uncomfortable extremely close together made for short trips within Asia not the long legged Australians. The magazine holder has been shifted to the top of the seat to allow closer seats so expect a knee in the back the whole trip. The service was on a par with the planes very poor even by Qantas standards abrupt messy rushed food stale and poor quality.,1
2015,Appalling. Unreliable. Outward flight delayed. Plane not clean. Rubbish lolly wrappers under seat in front. Return flight cancellation announced on almost indecipherable loudspeaker only 10 mins before boarding time then flashed up on screen at Boarding Gate. Such late notice (none received by SMS) left many stranded and those with already checked in baggage unable to transfer to another airline in time. We were forced to sit at airport an additional 4 hours to be seated on their next plane. Staff claimed Captain had called in sick. Surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in. To cap it off purported staff shortage on arrival at Tullamarine meant a further delay as cabin crew unable to open doors to allow already disgruntled passengers to disembark. No apologies. Not even an offer of a complimentary tea coffee or water in flight for those affected. Very bad PR. Don't try to speak to Senior Management about your experience or have them contact you - Jetstar claim they have no direct line. First and last time we travel with this airline. Booked through Qantas who code share. Have travelled other Qantas code share internationally on several occasions and never had an issue. Jetstar is low budget low everything. Never again never.,1
2015,Hobart-Melbourne on an A320. I used Qantas Frequent Flyer points for this flight and couldn't check in online beforehand either on the Qantas or Jetstar websites. The flight was smooth and the service was efficient. However the seating was much tighter than on the Virgin E190 I had used a few days earlier. A kid behind me kept kicking the seat. This wasn't Jetstar's fault but the seat felt very thin and I felt every kick!,0
2015,I have used Jetstar twice in the last year. Once from Melb to Bris and a few days ago Melb to Hobart. I find the flight staff to be extremely friendly and helpful with all aspects of flying. On the way to Hobart we had a very friendly air hostess and when she learnt it was my youngest boy's first time on a plane she said she may have a surprise for them and she left for a few minutes and upon her return explained we could go into the cockpit and meet the pilots and let the boys have a look around when we touch down. So friendly and the boys loved seeing inside the pilots world. Being a person who fears flying both trips were smooth and hassle free. I'm not a small lady but I found the seats comfy enough. No frills but all you need for short flights.,0
2015,We recently flew Jetstar Auckland to Gold Coast and had not one issue with them. We left on time check in was quick and easy the flight staff were efficient and friendly and helpful. The seat was comfortable enough for a short flight and we landed early. To be honest it was one of the better flights I have been on. I was pleasantly surprised after reading other reviews. Will fly with them again.,0
2015,We flew from Sydney to Cairns return and I have to say it was as good a flight as we have been on with any other airline. The service at the airports was good same as you would expect from any other airline. The flight attendants on the plane were extremely helpful and very nice. We paid extra for the exit row seats and had plenty of legroom as my husband is 6 foot tall so was happy to pay considering we were still saving on the cost of other airlines. The seats we had were airplane comfortable same as any other airline. Yes they didn't have food or entertainment however it's a 3 hour domestic flight so we just took out own food and put some movies on the tablet to watch together. It was a perfectly good flight with great service. No problems with them at all and would definitely fly with them again.,0
2015,MEL-BKK in economy on B787. Sort of your typical Jetstar experience. Cramped cabin little leg room nickel and dimed for everything. Add to this the fact that the in seat power and overhead reading light wasn't working (despite a few reset attempts) and it added up to a fairly unremarkable experience. Jetstar has also changed their check in for international flights at MEL adding slick new kiosks which generate boarding passes and baggage tags. All well and good however there is no longer a separate queue for online check ins necessitating a long wait in the single check in queue. Absolutely no value to a customer to check in online now - don't waste your time. Mostly Thai-based crew was pleasant and efficient and the flight was about 30 minutes early into BKK so that made up for the deficiencies I suppose.,1
2015,Have flown with Jetstar Perth to Bali return 3 times in the last two years and Perth to Vietnam return once. All I can say is congrats to Jetstar the service on board and at the terminal is first class. With the number of flights out of Perth daily especially to Bali why o why is Jetstar not flying the Boeing 787 out of Perth. Qantas fly internationally out of Perth.,0
2015,We travelled to Adelaide from Darwin in Dec and the seats were so uncomfortable it took two days for the pain to leave not only was there not sufficient room in the seating but the seats were as hard as rock. All Qantas flights booked out for months so no way of getting to Adelaide. I will never fly with this airline again. Lift your game Jetstar.,1
2015,Tokyo - Melbourne 21 February. A very pleasant flight. The staff were most helpful and friendly. The food was very tasteful and plentiful as well. I was also very impressed by the quality of the wines served. There was one hitch though the coffee served was cold. The IFE could have had a more extensive selection of movies and music. The seat was nothing like the normal business class flat beds but was fine for a daytime flight. Overall I was impressed.,0
2015,Melbourne - Phuket 3 February. I was quite impressed by the flight. The staff were friendly and helpful and the 787 was very comfortable. The food was quite good although the portions were quite small. I also wish the IFE had more choices.,0
2015,JQ58 DPS-BNE. Red-eye flight which was delayed by an hour departing 0035. This was our first flight with Jetstar in business class but paid for with QFF points (classic award). This apparently meant no entitlement to lounge access at Denpasar as ticket class was insufficient +/- we hadn't requested lounge access? (Had no idea we were meant to). This was an unhappy start to the flight as we'd been hanging out for a shower after a long day in Bali. Initial impression favourable staff friendly. Drinks offered and delivered promptly food order taken. Downhill from there. Partner's meal failed to materialise - seemed like everyone was getting meals in dribs and drabs (low staffing numbers?) so we kept waiting. Gave up when we realised staff had disappeared and cabin was asleep for the night. (Yes could have followed up but we were dead on our feet and preferred to sleep). The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes. No pillow only blow up neck rest in comfort packs. Entertainment system (screen in armrest) and headphones ok but choices limited compared to other airlines. Wouldn't use them again but options limited from DPS to Australia. Compared to Qantas very poor indeed.,1
2015,Perth to Singapore. Nothing special but this what you expect flying with budget airliners. Returning we were scheduled to fly from Singapore to Jetstar on the 2.20am flight. On arrival we saw that the flight was listed as 'cancelled'. We proceeded to speak with ground staff who vehemently denied any knowledge of flight cancellation and to their understanding the flight was still scheduled for departure as planned. We proceeded to check in and entered the departure gates. 2 hours prior to departure announced that the boarding gate had been changed. We went to this new arbitrary gate number but there was no boarding or ground staff in the vicinity. We waited patiently for 1.5 hrs 20 minutes prior to scheduled departure another passenger arrived to inform us he had confirmation that the flight had been cancelled. We were left to seek out the Jetstar information counter at which point the counter manned by 2 young and inexperienced staff members was swarmed by hundreds of passengers both from the cancelled flight as well as passengers from other flights seeking out their departure tickets. It was 2 hours before we were able to speak with a Jetstar ground staff who informed us 'they would place us on the next available flight - which could possibly be the flight on the following day or even a few days down the road if a seat could not be secured.' When asked about how passengers could go about making claims or trying to find alternative flights out of Singapore Jetstar staff could only offer a measly piece of photocopied information sheet explaining that the flight was cancelled and that should passengers choose to find their own alternative flight carrier that this would mean Jetstar bears no responsibility in fully refunding claims.,1
2015,Flew Melbourne to Honolulu. Delayed 4 hours before taking off. Missed connections in Honolulu which we then had to pay to get new flights as did half the rest of the plane. Otherwise flight as you would expect. Met people in Honolulu who had travelled in the last week delayed 26 hours out of Sydney and 24 hours out of Brisbane (in fact flown to Melbourne day after to get Melbourne Honolulu flight). Seems a few nightmares on this route for Jetsar at the moment.,1
2015,My partner and I were scheduled to fly from Singapore to Jetstar on the 2.20am flight. On arrival at Singapore Changi Airport we saw that the flight was listed as 'cancelled'. We proceeded to speak with ground staff who denied any knowledge of flight cancellation. We proceeded to check in and entered the departure gates. 2 hours prior to departure it was announced that the boarding gate had been changed. We went to this new gate number but there was no sight of any boarding or ground staff. All this while the flight was listed as 'cancelled' on the information board. Ground staff repeatedly assured us the flight was scheduled for departure as planned. We waited an hour and a half 20 minutes prior to scheduled departure another passenger arrived to inform us he has confirmation that the flight had been cancelled. At no point did a Jetstar staff member approach passengers to announce this. We were left to seek out the Jetstar information counter at which point the counter manned by 2 young and inexperienced staff members were swarmed by hundreds of passengers. It was almost 2 hours before we were able to speak with a staff member who informed us 'they would place us on the next available flight - which could possibly be the flight on the following day or even a few days down the road if a seat could not be secured.' Shocking and utterly disgraceful.,1
2015,Had the worst travel experience with Jetstar. The trip over from Brisbane to Honolulu was ok but upon coming home I received an email at 11.42pm saying that our flight was delayed. After ringing them I was told that it would be leaving two days later at 12.45am. I was put up in the airport hotel and given USD 30.00 for meals. The following night I was given a note under my door saying to get to the airport at 12.00am so assumed again that our flight was delayed again. Yes it was it wasn't leaving until 3.00am! When ringing Jetstar and going onto their website I was told that it was still leaving at 12.45am and again the website said that as well. Many frustrated and angry customers we all proceeded to the airport. No one at Jetstar knew what was going on and after waiting for over an hour a non Jetstar customer service lady proceeded to tell us that it wasn't leaving until 3.00am. Apart from her not one Jetstar representative agent came to talk to anyone on the flight. Where is the customer service?,1
2015,My much anticipated first flight on the Dreamliner turned out to be a bit of a disaster. My wife and I flew from Melbourne to Bangkok in economy. The entertainment system which we had pre booked did not work for either of us the screen had completely frozen and despite the best efforts of the crew to restart it numerous times it just would not go. Amazingly for such a new plane we were not the only one on the flight with this problem. The way JetStar have designed their entertainment unit is if it's unresponsive like ours were not only do you not get video but you cannot turn on the overhead light or call an attendant. It's all integrated in with each other. Due to the Dreamliner windows automatically shading out while mid flight we had to sit there in the dark with no entertainment or reading. Let me tell you it was a long 8 hour flight. I only picked JetStar for the Dreamliner experience. Never again.,1
2015,"Sydney to Honolulu (Business Class) on 10 February 2015. The moment I got into my seat I was taken down ""memory lane"" of the 1990's. The seat of Jetstar's Business Class was exactly the same seat taken when you're flying Business Class in the 1990's. The only thing that was added were the two in-seat power points. Makes me suspect that Jetstar/Qantas cut corners by re-using the old Business Class seats from old airframes and installed them here. Like the old Business Class seats the in-flight entertainment (IFE) is a very bulky iPad with equally bulky battery pack. The first meal dinner I was given a choice of two dishes. After dinner I ordered for black coffee 15 minutes later my ordered arrived as coffee with milk/coffee. I ordered Scotch after dinner and it arrived 20 minutes later as Scotch and soda. For breakfast I was given two choices: Take it or leave it. This is where Jetstar cuts costs again. Instead of hot meal you're given a bowl of cereals. The seats were hard and I didn't sleep a wink because it was just plain difficult to lean back. Personally I wouldn't recommend anyone to bother buying Business Class as it is really not worth it. I have flown Business Class (Cathay Pacific) and Premium Economy (Air New Zealand) and Jetstar's Business Class is BELOW (in standard) compared to Air New Zealand's Premium Economy. Hawaiian Airlines will start offering Premium Economy starting 15 March 2015 and I will be seriously considering this option.",1
2015,"It all went downhill once I checked it in Singapore for a round trip to Bangkok. This airline charges for your first checked bag - for both legs of a round trip. My fare was only $150 but my fare for one suitcase was $100. When I showed my displeasure I was asked if I wanted to pay the fee. ""What choice do I have?"" I snapped back. But I was assured the fee of $50 would be for both ways and was told to keep the receipt to show when I checked in for my return flight. They either lied or didn't know their own airline's procedures. Things were no better on the plane where everything had a price - water coffee even the blankets and pillows. In addition the seat backs are only fabric on the bottom half and the knees of the person behind you can be felt for the whole trip particularly since there was scant room for your legs. Never again.",1
2015,JQ5 BNE-HNL Business Class 10 February 2015. Left BNE on time cabin crew very attentive serving drinks on boarding and throughout flight. Dinner served was excellent for 3-star airline value 3 courses served separately with quality wines. Continental breakfast served into HNL. Seats comfortable although reclining only. Booked two seats in centre of cabin and enjoyed the extra room of vacant seat. Can't comment on IFE as we didn't use it. Return flight HNL-BNE on 15 February also very good arriving at destination 25 min early. Reading past reviews there seems to be many bad experiences but we have only experienced excellent flights in BC on previous OOL-NRT flights.,0
2015,Recently flew the Narita (Tokyo) - Gold coast route Star Class. Checking staff at Narita - very Ordinary! Delayed by 2 hrs departing - Tech issue just prior to take off - had to get towed back to the gate. In all fairness the Captain did the correct thing and didn't take off - he kept us all up updated via the loud speaker. Finally took off 2 hours later. Missed my connecting flight - then had to go on stand by - what a joy that was. The actual trip back to Aust was a very smooth flight - very little noise. Cabin crew were quite good. Food was very good. Far better than I received on my outgoing Qantas Business Class flight. Star Class seating was fine - have to keeping mind its a budget carrier. Would I Fly Star Class Internationally again? Most defiantly - Its far cheaper and you still get the feel that your special. I would sooner pocket the savings I would make on traveling with Jetstar B/C to Qantas B/C. By the way my outgoing flight to Tokyo was on a very old rattly 747- although they have upgraded the Business class to flat beds. The flight crew were all due to be pensioned off - couldn't believe how old they all appeared to be - however they all were very polite and attentive in Business class I say bring on more new 787s - very good flying experience.,0
2015,"Outbound 12 Feb JQ029. Home 19 Feb JQ030. Great Crew and excellent service. Good food and drink selection and they were quite generous with it! However the worst business class seat ever. In my humble opinion the executive who chose this should be strapped to one for 24 hours I think he or she may need hospitalisation afterwards! To be honest I can not believe that Boeing allowed Jetstar to do this to a Dreamliner. I was nearly crippled when I got off and I am only 5'10"".",1
2015,I flew JQ4 today from Honolulu to Sydney and the flight crew were fantastic. There was an ill passenger on the plane and the cabin crew did everything to help him. They had medical staff check him before the flight and looked after him through out the flight. The service on the plane was excellent. Jetstar is a low cost carrier and is a lot cheaper than other airlines so yes you pay for extras. I read a lot of people whining about extra costs. Do you not understand that is why the airfare is cheap. If you want the additional benefits at no charge fly a full service airline. I flown on many airlines and really found Jetstar to be great value. They were on time and the cabin staff were pleasant. Keep up the good work Jetstar!,0
2015,Flight from Sydney to Launceston and return. Check in at both airports very quick and efficient. Boarding good. Paid for extra legroom and felt this worth the additional payment. Both flights departure and arrival on time.,0
2015,Flew LST-SYD - Check in took no time at all and the staff were very friendly on the ground and in the air. Cabin was very new well ventilated but most importantly clean. Despite being only an A320 the seats were much bigger than local domestic rival 737-800s and were much more comfortable. Would have been nice to have received complimentary beverage. Baggage claim was very quick and was ready exactly as I arrived at the carousel.,0
2015,I travelled with my family from Melbourne to Bali by Jetstar the flight was scheduled at 10.15am and departed at Melbourne at 1pm. The carrier was 787 Dreamliner but very disappointed with the interior and you have to pay for everything. Then from Bali to Melbourne same Jerstar and the flight scheduled at 14.45 and when we reached airport for check in they said the flight is rescheduled at 20.00 due to engineering requirements. What a terrible service they are not even bothered to inform about their delays.,1
2015,I commented earlier about my bad experience from MEL-BNE last week well the return flight from BNE-MEL JQ006 was no better. The flight was delayed by well over an hour due to Jetstar not being able to find a passenger. Don't we all scan in for a reason? Firstly we had to be there well before as it was an international stopover flight for our domestic portion so I had to queue at customs. Then they decided to delay 300+ passengers on Australia day Then after already costing me $247 more from the trip up they wouldn't even give us a drink. I was told I had to purchase one and the staff couldn't care less. Never again.,1
2015,"Booked flight Perth to Singapore take off time 12.10 am ""ten past midnight."" Flight was delayed because of bad weather until 1pm ""one o clock in the afternoon."" We had booked this flight so that we could allow for up to 8-9 hours delay because we know that they are famous for not taking off on time. We had to catch a cruise so the 13 plus hour delay which we ended up with would make us to late for the ship. We were told by Jetstar staff there would be no refund and the only thing we could do was to try and get seats on Singapore Airlines which after lots of running around the airport we were able to locate Singapore Airlines office and managed to get the last 2 seats at a cost of over $1000. We then proceeded to fly the same route that Jetstar could not fly because of bad weather. Tiger Airways also took off on time Jetstar being the only Airline grounded because of bad weather. If we had allowed ourselves more time and booked the same flight 24 hours earlier we would still have had to wait until 13-00 hrs because the flight the night before had also been ""delayed"".",1
2015,"Flying return from Perth to Melbourne. Our initial flight was due to leave at 10am only to receive an email the night before at 9pm informing our plane had been cancelled due to ""scheduled maintenance"" we had to very quickly rebook ourselves onto a plane that left at 12.45am or 1pm the next day. We were lucky to get seats on the 12.45am flight however the seats at the very back of the plane ""designated for cabin crew."" Because this is a budget airline we really didn't expect many thrills but the back seats allow for little room to recline and the three seats in a row are so compact it was the most uncomfortable experience I've had on a plane. The seats are like cement the faux leather is super sticky and the leg room is ridiculously tiny if you are larger than a size 14 I'm sure you would be terribly claustrophobic. The cabin crew also burnt the coffee which stunk out the entire cabin. Luckily for us this flight did get us in to Melbourne 8 hours earlier than we had first booked so a small positive to say the least. On our return journey from Melbourne to Perth - only four days later - we were due to board the plane having been called over the speaker to get our boarding passes ready to then be told over the speaker that ""we think the plane has been cancelled."" We had to quickly run out to the departure check in grab our checked in bags off the carousel and attempt to be rebooked onto another flight. Thankfully we were changed to a flight (operated by Qantas) to Perth via Adelaide with an extra waiting time of 2 hours in Melbourne airport. Again things turned out well for us given you get IFE on Qantas flights and food/drinks are included however this experience really does remind us that paying the extra cash for an airline Virgin Australia or Qantas is much more reliable. I'm all for flying cheap airlines but this experience was a joke how can one airline have so many problems in four days? Not once did we receive a sincere apology from Jetstar flight.",1
2015,JQ 27 12 Jan. Very bad experience. Never again. Travelled with Jetstar to Phuket because they flew direct. They were not cheaper than other airlines available at the time just the flight times were good. Everything on this flight came with an extra cost. Food drinks entertainment and even a blanket for our daughter who was feeling cold came at an additional cost. I think Jetstar have poor service and are a rip off. I will not fly again or recommend this airline to others.,1
2015,How can you take the latest greatest most modern aircraft flying (787 Dreamliner) and make it so damn uncomfortable? I have just returned from a holiday to Bali and flew Jetstar. I was actually quite excited to be flying the 787 for the first time after all the hype about comfort air quality bigger windows and low noise levels. What an enormous disappointment. Jetstar have managed to take such an advanced and modern aircraft and jam it with cramped seats down in economy with terrible leg room. I am not even that big 175cm. It looks like they had a team from Tupperware design and install the entire interior of this plane. Plastic everywhere. The food (pre-purchased) was marginal at best and it'll cost you $10 to watch a movie. You go to all that trouble of installing screens in the back of the seat and it seemed hardly anyone bothered paying. The actual inflight experience (bigger windows air quality and smooth flight) was OK - and I am looking forward to flying the 787 again with an airline that actually designed a cabin with a hint of passenger comfort in mind. Thankfully it's only a 6 hour run up to Bali and slightly shorter coming home. Honestly Qantas Group - you should have kept the Dreamliner for the 'nicer' brand - and given you old bangers to 'little brother' Jetstar.,1
2015,JQ35 MEL-DPS on the 787 Dreamliner. Paid for the exit row well worth the money. A good service and a really nice comfortable aircraft I'm not sure why it's getting such bad feedback. As my first international Jetstar flight I was satisfied.,0
2015,"Osaka to Cairns on Jetstar JQ16. I chose business class and left the flight feeling that the customer care food and cabin comfort was good. The food which was better than previous flights. My return flight JQ23 from MEL to Tokyo NRT - a very disappointing experience in 20 years of business travel. Check-in was the best customer handling that I had experienced with Jetstar. Two hours later at the gate the boarding process was mismanaged and turned into a stampede of economy and business class passengers jostling for access at the same time. Staff were flustered and lost control. The cabin crew communication customer handling and courtesy was very good. I appreciated their efforts and acknowledge that Jetstar standards has improved. The worst Business Class meal - 3 choices chicken and noodle pea and cheese soup or Hamburger ""raked"" sliced pork. The meal arrived - the hamburger was a dry reheated toasted sandwich with two pickles and mustard. Not a hamburger. One thin slice of pork between soggy reheated toast and pickles. This was not an optional snack this was the main course standard for business class. It gets worse the desert was two shortbread cookies and no tea or coffee. The breakfast was good with fruit yoghurt juice. I requested tea which was cold. I hadn't realised that Jetstar had included an inflatable neck cushion in the the comfort pack - a thoughtful and beneficial improvement however when I tried to brush my teeth before landing the tooth paste was missing and there was no paper cups in the toilet. These basic products are important. I can't brush my teeth so the comfort pack became ineffective. Jetstar is a budget airline it is not Singapore Airlines so fair assessment is needed considering value-for-money. Jetstar has made many improvements with cabin crew and ground staff customer handling skills. As I confirmed in my flight ex-Japan Jetstar can provide good food that meets business class expectations. However the toasted sandwich and cookies main course has me questioning whether my next flight to Australia in August should be with another airline. Jetstar's weak point - it cannot sustain a basic standard the difference between the two flight experiences was huge. Conversely its cabin staff and check-in staff have shown tangible improvement with courtesy and efficiency.",1
2015,"I flew from Darwin to Brisbane and Brisbane to Darwin. I am 6' 4"" and just can not fit in the seats. Very uncomfortable and painful for 4 hours. Never again.",1
2015,SYD-BNE JQ824. Boarding at Sydney was utter chaos since for some unknown reason we were using a Tiger Air gate far from the usual Jetstar gates which had very little seating. The Jetstar airport crew had absolutely no idea what was going on and made boarding announcements by shouting at us and ordering passengers around. The previous flight was late arriving and it was a nightmare trying to disembark and then board passengers in such a small space. The flight itself was okay but the amount of legroom was very limited making me uncomfortable. Departed 35 minutes behind schedule and arrived 25 minutes late. As Jetstar is a budget airline I was not expecting high standards however the quality was disappointing. Next time I would be more than happy to spend a little extra to fly Qantas or Virgin.,1
2015,Poor trip with Jetstar will be happy if I never travel with them again. Our direct flight was cancelled Sydney to Phuket and we were then sent through Sydney-Melbourne-Phuket meaning an extra few hours before we even left Australia. Once on board our Melbourne Phuket plane the seats were quite comfortable. Meal times were different we had paid and pre-ordered meals but no they had no record of that even though it was printed on our ticket. This meant we had no meals as only those prepaid and recorded were put on board. We could then purchase a toasted sandwich or pie most uninteresting and unsatisfying. The staff were less than helpful daughter had an infant and was not offered a spare cushion or any other help.,1
2015,Bali - Melbourne 29 December. Business. A comfortable flight with very attentive and friendly staff. The seats are quite comfortable although nothing like Qantas or Singapore Airlines Business class. More like premium economy. The food was very filling and tasty with an excellent choice of drinks. My only complaint is that the IFE included was very limited. Just a very small selection of movies and music. Overall a very pleasant flight and worth the extra cost.,0
2015,24 December 2014. Melbourne to Bali. A satisfactory flight. Very friendly helpful staff. The new 787 was very comfortable. I prepaid the IFE and food. The IFE was very limited. They should extend the range of movies and music. The food was quite good but also quite limited for a 6 hour flight. The main meal could have been more substantial and some sort of late evening snack should have been included.,0
2015,"How else can you get out of Darwin to Bali? Jetstar cancelled our flight without much reason given ""come back tomorrow"" - so lost a whole day in Bali with all that went with that next day ""oh dear!"" we're diverting you via Melbourne. So back thousands of miles and then onwards to Bali - more lost time. Compensation offered was laughable. Sincerely given apologies? No way. They don't seem to be able to say sorry. As this was the first step of my journey home to England it didn't help that they also lost my luggage. They don't seem to have any up to date systems even though I gather they're a part of Qantas not that they're going to admit that.",1
2014,Melbourne to Hobart and return in A320s. Everyone knows that Christmas week is very busy with long queues at the airport but Jetstar could make it much easier for passengers at Tullamarine by having a dedicated bag drop queue. Then there would be some point to checking in at home. The long queue that I had to join included both people who had already checked in and others who hadn't. After being called out of the queue to catch my plane there was a long wait in the airless dungeon that passes for Jetstar's terminal - then a late gate change which led us back into the Qantas terminal -- and then a long motionless queue with no information. Finally we were able to board around 30 minutes late. Once on the plane the journey was fine. The seat was comfortable and the service was friendly. There was a long wait at Hobart for luggage probably due to the arrival of another Jetstar aircraft minutes before ours. The return journey could not have been more different. Quick efficient check-in and boarding a comfortable seat (I was offered an exit row seat at check-in) and arrival in Melbourne 20 minutes early. However at baggage pick-up we followed the signs to carousel 1 where we waited for a long time before finding out that our luggage was spinning around carousel 4 (with no signs).,0
2014,First time with Jetstar to Bangkok on 17th December. The flight from Singapore to Bangkok was fine. 15 minutes into the return flight to Singapore we had to return to Bangkok as ice had formed on the wings. We waited for more than 2 hours at the airport without knowing what would happen next. There was no communication between the ground staff and the passengers. We did even get a drink from the ground staff. Only when we approached the staff then we realized we had to stay in Bangkok for another night. Without giving proper instructions we were lead like blind mice around the airport. We waited again for more than half an hour before we were transported to a hotel near the airport. The ground staff were not be able to handle the situation well which left us feeling lost and frustrated. This will be my first and last flight with Jetstar.,1
2014,JQ25/JQ26 Cairns to Tokyo and back on a Boeing 787-800 first row - business class which in terms of the seat and service is equivalent to international premium class or Qantas domestic business class. Very good service. Good food and drinks as much as you want. First time on a 787 decided to treat myself. IFE with limited selection. Good earphones. Comfortable seat although it is a recliner one and not lie flat. Plenty of legroom in row 1. Just to bypass the largest queue I ever saw at Narita airport and go straight to the check in counter worth the upgrade. Only thing missing is priority bag service to receive it first upon arrival.,0
2014,Economy airline with really low special prices. Flew nearly 10 hrs Sydney to Honolulu return. Why don't they turn off the overhead TV screens rather than endlessly show the flight progress? This small detail would greatly improve the chance of sleeping. I didn't pay much so can't expect much I suppose.,0
2014,I have flown Jetstar a number of times over the last few months most recently to Cairns and return.. Their planes are new and clean and I find the staff overall very good. All flights I have been on have been on time. They have now become my domestic airline of choice.,0
2014,Flew Melbourne-Osaka KIX via Cairns and Tokyo Narita-Melbourne. Flight over was on a 787 which was nice and new. Return flight on an older A330. Seats reasonably comfortable on both flights. Both flights on time. Service is basically non-existent. Crew seem so disorganised. Not sure what they do for the majority of the flight as you do not see them. If Jetstar are much cheaper fly with them but all in all even considering they are a low cost carrier flying with them is a nothing experience.,1
2014,Flew MEL-DPS on 14 Nov on the 787 neat new aircraft - food was disappointing - not worth the $15 AUD. You are better off having a nice feed at the airport before take off. Drinks etc as expected overpriced not many options once you're in the air. Staff were doing the bare minimum to make things better. Just because its a low cost carrier it should not equate to a Low Level of Service. Certainly will be considering other options before booking Jetstar again.,1
2014,Business class JQ47 from BNE to Bali. We had to walk from the airport building along the runway to the plane on the scorching sun. Flight was delayed more than hour due to wrong meals being loaded. Business class seats are total disaster more like premium economy. Touch screen is worse than any screen in economy class on any other airline. It was freezing cold during the flight. On my way back from Bali to BNE I spent few hours in the Premier Lounge which was hardly better than average pub in BNE. Walking back again from the plane to the building in BNE. Never again Jetstar.,1
2014,This airline should only be used in desperation as you last option. The ground staff which should be friendly and helpful treated me disrespectfully as if was my fault. I arrived at Sydney airport 40min before my 5.25pm scheduled departure for Melbourne and for several minutes was unsuccessfully trying to get my boarding pass using my Qantas Frequent Flyer Card at one of the automatic machines. When I was unable to get my boarding pass I approached the help desk. At the time I managed to speak with an assistant it was exactly 30 min before my scheduled Melbourne bound service. The service clerk informed me that I am now late for my flight and all other flights to Melbourne are fully booked and I can only fly the next morning. Being very unhappy with such treatment I informed the clerk that I will not be using Jetstar airline in future and then arranged my flight with Qantas for 6.30pm.,1
2014,Flew MEL-LST. Arrived early at airport only to be told we weren't able to use the bag drop. Check-In staff were rather rude. Plane was old and dirty. Flight landed 5 mins late. Cabin Crew were quite good. Overall you are better off flying Virgin.,1
2014,Flew between Sydney and Uluru. The flights themselves were what you would expect from a budget airline. The check-in process however was a total shambles. At Sydney Airport there was just one long line for all their departures. Using the automated check-in machines was a waste of time - when we eventually reached the check-in desk the baggage tags we'd carefully put on were unceremoniously ripped off. We were still in the middle of the long line having arrived two hours before our scheduled departure time when we heard someone shouting our flight number. With great difficulty we managed to extricate ourselves and baggage from 'the maze'. Eventually we found the check-in desk where our flight number was being shouted. The check-in clerks were complaining to each other that they weren't being sent the right passengers. The return flight from Uluru wasn't much better despite being the only departure that afternoon. At the check-in they waited until all the passengers arrived before they very slowly began the process. Very galling to watch them sitting behind the check-in desks doing nothing while we all stood in line. Even when they did condescend to start work they seemed to believe that chatting between themselves was a higher priority than dealing with their customers. Value for money? I would want to be paid to experience that again.,1
2014,"Flew MEL-SYD on their 787 aircraft. At check was directed to international terminal as aircraft was going on to Bali. This added significant amount time as we had clear immigration and customs for a domestic flight. I had to pay $50 to check my bag even though I had an onward international ticket to the US- this was not told to me when I bought it. On board we sat at the gate for 1 hour while the crew waited for last minute ""paperwork"" so arrival was delayed by 1 hour. Did not even offer water for free so all in all the price was the same as Qantas.",1
2014,I booked with Qantas frequent flyer points on the Qantas site and received all Qantas conditions etc. I went to the Qantas counter in Brisbane and was told I was to go down to Jetstar because it was a JQ number I was flying Jetstar? I had just driven to Brisbane as Qantas do not go to the Sunshine Coast. When I arrived at Jetstar there was just one girl attending to the baggage drop. I was eventually given my boarding pass and allocated seat 17. The Jetstar representative checking the cabin luggage was very officious. I lined up and the representative said to weigh my handbag computer and fascinator for the Cup the fascinator weighed nothing the total weight was well under 10kgs. The fascinator was damaged during this process. I asked if I could just carry the fascinator on board then she said you can only have 2 bags. I said the hat weighs nothing though. She said well put the hat on your head! I then boarded the plane and by the time the food arrived the air hostess said there was nothing left and I had to go without a decent lunch. Prior to boarding the plane there were four people near me who swore they would not fly with Jetstar again. I was very disappointed overall and definitely believe you have issues that need to be addressed.,1
2014,First flights with Jetstar. JQ29 MEL-BKK and JQ30 BKK-MEL. Both flights comfortable and enjoyable by current discount airline standards. The only negative a 50 minute delay boarding (MEL) but the flight then arrived at destination early so it mattered little. Seat comfort good food good service good and attentive and IFE good. Business class with a discount airline is of course really the equivalent of premium economy with a full service airline. I can't speak for those travelling economy but can't see the justification in complaints about lack of extras when the customer chose the most inexpensive options not to pay for them. You get what you pay for.,0
2014,Business Class from Denpasar to Sydney was a total waste of money. My husband had a fixed metal box between his feet Seat 2G and had to sit at an angle to stretch his legs. The footrest was of no value whatsoever. The so called 'touch' screen required a hard tap to operate and I felt every selection the passenger behind me made. He also had long legs and therefore I couldn't recline my seat as far as I wanted. The flight departed at 10.30pm and was scheduled to take just over 5 hrs. The first hour of the flight was taken up with Business Class passengers eating their 'free' meal. The small window of opportunity to sleep was reduced. The toilet was Out of Order from the start of the flight. We fly Economy Jetstar regularly and have low expectations high satisfaction. But to pay extra for this Business Class flight our expectations were higher and not met. So disappointing.,1
2014,Missed my BNE-CNS flight due to 2hrs holdup in Customs. Must say since I was coming off a SQ flight I didn't expect much help from Jetstar when I arrived 8 minutes after the gate closed but the staff radioed through and did their best to get me on. After it was clear that wasn't going to happen they cheerfully rebooked me for the morning flight and even gave me a front seat which was really nice. As for the flight it was fine staff are great but Jetstar seats always give me a back ache but maybe that's just me.,0
2014,We flew return from Melbourne to Tokyo on Jetstar. The flights were non stop so only 10 hours. Each flight left and arrived on time. The staff were efficient and friendly. We pre ordered vegetarian meals and they were excellent in fact some of the best airline food we have had. There is no inflight entertainment as advertised so we took our own iPads loaded with books and movies. We only had carry on luggage and although it complied with weight restrictions no one checked the size and weight. The seat pockets needed a good clean out as I found on both trips but the cabin and bathrooms were kept clean throughout the trip. The distance to the seat in front was a little squishy when the couple in front threw their seats back for the the return trip. This would be a problem if you are large. But I've had the problem on higher priced full serviced flights so it comes down to the courtesy of your fellow travellers. To date we have taken about 10 Jetstar flights and never a problem. You get what you pay for which initially is just a seat. All in all I will continue to fly Jetstar when the cost and flight duration remain so competitive.,0
2014,Travelled from Gold Coast - Cairns on Sat 18/10/2014 with walk on bags no charge. Returned on Wed 22/10/2014 with walk on bags as same as gold Coast - extra charge $50.,1
2014,Melbourne to Honolulu - we chose to fly Jetstar as it is the only airline that flies to Honolulu direct from Melbourne. It markets itself as a low cost no frills airline. It was certainly no frills but definitely not low cost. We flew the week before September school holidays and the airfares were very expensive. Overall I would describe the experience as mediocre. We were in economy and walking through business class I would not pay the extra for what looked like a sub par business class offering. The seats were okay but what you would expect on a domestic flight not a long haul international flight. It was a night flight so people were wanting to try and sleep. In the row behind us were four off duty Qantas flight attendants who proceeded to drink to excess talk extremely loudly and swear constantly disturbing other passengers for at least four hours. The flight attendants on our flight took about 5 hours to finally tell them to quieten down. I was astounded that they thought it was okay to disturb other passengers for hours on end. Appalling behaviour that should have been pulled up sooner. Inflight entertainment is non existent on back of seats which is ridiculous. You can rent Ipads for $18 which were woeful. The limited range of movies seemed to be geared towards the male audience. Even the lifestyle section was a selection of cars and music shows. They really need to take a good look at this very limited and poor offering. We heard many fellow passengers complaining about the Ipad content also. Food was either pre booked and very expensive meals or snacks you could buy on board. Take your own food on board would be my advice. It would have been good to see more gluten free offerings rather than a cookie. Service was basic not particularly friendly and mostly absent. Overall a below average experience.,1
2014,Flew on JQ527 from Sydney to Melbourne on 17/9. As a normal Qantas traveller and having not travelled on Jetstar for 8 years I was pleasantly surprised of how good the service was. The flight itself was full and boarded late. Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas. My only problem was that there was no inflight entertainment whatsoever although I suppose that's the case with most budget airlines.,0
2014,My family of three traveled from Manila to Sydney. We were delayed 2 days in Manila and were not informed when our flight will be until the last minute. They put us up in a very nice hotel in Manila while we were waiting. The morning of the flight they decided to take everyone to the airport at least 3 hours before the flight. I guess they were going for the Guinness book of records for the longest queue ever. Because they didn't start checking people in until all the bus loads had arrived. Little did I know this was a sign of what was to come. We had to change at Darwin to a connecting domestic flight where we arrived about 1pm. As our connecting flight was not there yet they put us up in a hotel in Darwin. We had to wait in a queue in Darwin 3 hours for our new tickets. That plus the 2.5 hours we had to wait in Manila plus an hour at the hotel. All this waiting in queues with a 12 month old infant. The flight from Darwin to Sydney left about 2am. A family we made friends with while waiting in the queue suffered worse than us. They were put off the plane at Darwin because their baby had eczema around it's mouth. Wasn't the whole family just the father and 3 kids. Mother was waiting for them in Sydney. The pilot said the family was removed because the child had an obvious illness. I witnessed the whole event and the pilot never left the cockpit. Anyone that has had a child with eczema would have known what it was. so anyway the family was taken off the plane and left on the bridge. One of the flight attendants coldly carried the sleeping girl and dumped her on the bridge. A memorably bad experience. If you have a family don't fly Jetstar. They also promised to give us $200 worth of coupons each for future flights which turned out to be $50 when we tried to get them.,1
2014,HNL-SYD and HBA-SYD return. First of all our flight from Hobart was delayed by nearly 2 hours. When we arrived in Sydney were told that no luggage had been loaded. It was very windy in Hobart so I get why this happened but we were off to Hawaii. Had we been given notice before checking in the luggage that this was a possibility we could have got our swimmers out and left the big bag in Hobart. Anyway Jetstar managed to give us about 3 different stories about when our luggage would arrive in Hawaii and each was completely contradictory. I spent perhaps 3 hours in the first couple of days trying to chase down what was going on. On the HNL SYD flight the attendants all seemed to be lovely but were absolutely hopeless. They were disorganised we didn't get a veg meal that we had ordered. The cabin was an absolute pigsty too - there was an overwhelming smell of urine there were coffee drips on my tray table milk spilt over the seat a carton of milk shoved down the side of the seat previous passengers' rubbish in the seatback compartment. I took my daughter to the toilet about 10 minutes after the seatbelt sign had been switched off and there was urine on the floor. We got back to SYD late and we missed our connecting flight. I had tried twice before leaving HNL to check in online it wouldn't let me. Tried again before going through customs wouldn't let me. I then called once we had got though customs talked to someone who told me she should be able to get it done. I asked her if she could let me know the quickest way to get to domestic and she said she could then put me on hold. Very long story short I ended up on the phone to her for 38 minutes got to check in 29 minutes before takeoff and was not allowed on the plane. I have travelled with Jetstar many times and at this stage the bad experiences outnumber the good about 3-1. Last time on a flight from HBA to MLB I organised (booked and paid for) transport via Jetstar and ended up at the airport with the company having no record of it and refusing to pick me up. The thing that I think frustrates me the most is that through all this it has been me who has had to chase everything up. Had we had decent communication and correct answers it would have been manageable.,1
2014,Another horrible experience. Last year I experienced a 4 hour delay in Melbourne on my return trip to Sydney which they blamed initially on mechanical trouble and a further plethora of excuses which I just tolerated at the time. Yesterday October 13th 2014 I copped another dose of Jetstars incompetence and attitude to its passengers. Supposed flying JQ413 at3pm to Sydney - arrived at 2pm. At 2.30pm an announcement made that the flight was cancelled (with no explanation) and that we were to be bussed 100km to Brisbane to join JQ817 to Sydney which didn't depart until 6.30pm. So instead of being home in Sydney at 5.30 pm we got there at 9.20 pm 4 hours late. Totally unacceptable. They don't provide proper service to their customers and as far as Im concerned I will never fly Jetstar again.,1
2014,JQ3 SYD-HNL. First time travel on JQ international to Honolulu not expecting much but very impressed. Purchased tickets months out so had the opportunity to get business class at a good price. Wide leather seats drink before departure and order off the menu adds the nice touch. Plenty of drinks and snacks after dinner and service very attentive. Stewardess very friendly and gave some tips on Hawaii as this first time there. Very impressed with the service and general experience overall. IFE limited but ok. If you can afford business class do it.,0
2014,First and last time I will ever use Jetstar. You get what you pay for with this airline. Flew round trip from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The departure was fine nothing too major besides the language barrier. The return trip-was hell. I arrived at the airport and checked into the terminal at 1pm for a 2:30 flight. At 2 pm the notification was released that this flight and only this flight was to be postponed for 3 hours due to weather that was scheduled to arrive later that night. Why would you delay a flight so that it departs when weather turns bad vs while it's nice and sunny? I went to the ticket counter to enquire about being moved to the next available flight out and of course the next flights to my destination are on time and full. Great. So now my 2.30 departure is now a 5pm departure while all other airlines are on schedule. he attendant says I am more than welcome to book an earlier fight with a different carrier and will be refunded part of my trip - I was 'credited' 92USD not even close to half of the cost of the total trip but it was a refund. I proceed to a different carrier and walk away at the $430 one way option and sadly go back the original carrier after the prices were higher at each different carrier. I purchased the only flight to my destination for $115 - the only open and next available flight. I paid for the same seat twice. I have a seat on a plane that once again is delayed. The departure is pushed to 8pm. While 2 flights to my destination from the same carrier leaving the same terminal are not delayed.,1
2014,Domestic Vietnam HAN-SGN-HAN on 10 and 12 October 2014. Airbus 320 both ways. Delays but I was informed early (SMS and email) and eventually in both cases - offered even better departure times as compared to what I was booked for. Staff nicely dressed in fresh youth style with black T-shirts (with discrete logo) and trousers. They were fast alert smiling and very friendly despite the flight was full to the very last seat. This is a LCC without free onboard service - but prices are low e.g. a hot meal (4 options) is 3 dollars inc. soft drink. The giftshop onboard offers e.g. colourful ladybags with airline logos for 4 USD. Jetstar depends on bus transfers in both airports as LCC carriers obviously do not get access the direct boarding/disembarkation gates.,0
2014,CHC-SYD-MAROOCHYDORE return in late May / June 2014. Jetstar were almost obsessive about punctuality and to their credit these 4 flights were either right on time or earlier. The aircraft were all clean staff appeared friendly and helpful. Most enjoyable flights that met my expectations. Only thing is the seats are nearly always so hard that my backside becomes numb. Thousands of pax sitting for hrs on these seats soon destroys much of their cushioning. I never buy onboard. Bring my own food and bottled water. Here in New Zealand we regularly travel CHC- AKL-CHC and only use Jetstar. Punctual good fares and we are always satisfied in every way. They are a popular well used airline in NZ and vital competition for Air NZ. Overall satisfied with Jetstar as an airline.,0
2014,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary. Next time we pay more and fly with anyone but Jetstar.,1
2014,Flight from Narita to Cairns was delayed due to mechanical problems - fair enough. Then we could not take off due to Narita being closed after 11pm - again fair enough. Captain very apologetic. That was nice. All passengers had to disembark retrace their steps through immigration and pick up their luggage - again fair enough I suppose. But then the whole planeload of passengers was left milling around trying to find out what was going to happen from a couple of harassed young Japanese Jetstar employees with limited English who were doing their level best in the face of increasingly bewildered and irritated passengers. After an hour or so news filtered through that there would be another flight late the following day. Eventually someone must have found the key to the room where the public address microphone is but no accommodation arranged or suggested and a couple of hundred people with all their bags simply left to their own devices in a deserted terminal in the middle of the night. Delays happen of course they do but you need a contingency plan for occasions such as these - and invest in a bullhorn for heavens sake so that you can keep people informed. When we eventually did get off the ground the service was fine and the food good.,1
2014,Flew from Sydney-Melbourne-Bangkok and back. The staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. There was no consideration to the urgency to make adjoining flights. Landing back in Melbourne it took them 40 minutes to get our bags onto the turnstile because the 'machine was broken' so thus missed adjoining domestic connection. On top of that- Melbourne custom officers were slow and condescending.,1
2014,My family and I caught a flight from SYD-MEL and I was very disappointed. The cabin crew were extremely unhelpful. There was no inflight entertainment whatsoever (not even the radios you could use on your arm rest like on other domestic airlines such as Virgin and Qantas). When we arrived in Melbourne Jetstar had lost my luggage. They contacted us in saying it should show up in 3 to 4 days and we were only in Melbourne for 4 days! It seemed like they didn't care at all! I would never travel with Jetstar again.,1
2014,We love Jetstar. Flew MEL-SIN on Friday 19th September. Flight was delayed by about 15 minutes but this time was made up. Check-in was seamless flight was comfortable. I was lucky enough to have a spare seat next to me. Cabin crew were friendly enough. Inflight entertainment was good but more variety would be appreciated particularly for children. It was a little frustrating that the cabin crew require photo ID for the inflight entertainment. Didn't have any photo ID besides my passport. A boarding pass sufficed but the flight attendant was not so happy I didn't have photo ID. Smooth landing in Singapore completed our pleasant experience with Jetstar. We brought our own snacks so didn't use their food and beverage service.,0
2014,OOL-NRT Business 14 Sept 2014 seats 1A/C. Dreamliner. Flight was on time departing leaving mid morning. Flight attendants were attentive friendly and professional drinks offered before take-off orders taken for lunch and drinks. The seats in Row 1 are definitely the most comfortable with no one in front reclining and plenty of legroom. The lunch was delicious my wild mushroom arancini were as good as any I've tasted. I had a glass of Royal Chivers and the attendant made sure it was topped up necessitating an afternoon nana nap! A late afternoon snack of warm beef foccacia sandwich before getting into Tokyo was also excellent. Only gripe is the footrests are low and on the night return flight I would prefer the legs more elevated. However value for money one can't complain. I'll save time here and say the return flight on Sept 24 was also very good the meal not so good but a reasonable standard.,0
2014,"Flew Bali to Perth on Jetstar. I had used Qantas FF points to book a ""Rewards"" flight and ended up on Jetstar as Qantas does not fly internationally out of Perth. Go figure. I paid for front row seats so had lots of legroom. I got the legroom and that's it. The seat was hard as a rock and I duidnt want to recline as I would have suffocated the poor passenger behind me. The staff completely disinterested and no service offered. The best I can say is we arrived home safely. We will never fly Jetstar again. Air Asia is far better.",1
2014,"MEL-BKK Economy A330-200. How does one start with Jetstar International? Firstly the Thai crew are excellent and are far superior to the domestic version in Australia. The aircraft was on time and was a comfortable flight from an engineering perspective. However the interior of this aircraft can only be described as a time capsule whereby the interior designer had a selection of interiors and said ""That's the one - the theme we will go for is recycled 1970's Estonian disco."" To be fair not all of the seats were broken mine reclined on the left side thereby putting my left shoulder on the lap of the person behind me while my right shoulder was touching the back of the seat in front of me. I especially liked the rips in the ""leather"" that allowed me to hang my mobile phone for viewing of videos. Very thoughtful. Also the 3 TV's that came with the plane at the front of interior did not work so we couldn't even follow a flight map. On the return leg same story re interior. I understand that with budget carriers you get what you pay for but I paid for a seat with oxygen and almost got ripped off.",1
2014,I will never fly this airline again. Our flight at the moment has been delayed 11.5 hrs and increasing as I sit at the airport. We have missed the Singapore Grand Prix day 1 race and concert (which we had tickets for). The communication to let us know what was going on was appalling. By the time they decided to let us know what was going on the earliest flight we could rebook for was 10.5 hrs later. My advice is never fly Jetstar.,1
2014,SYD to MEL on Sept 15th 2014 and return on 18th. Found staff friendly and obliging and the landing back in Sydney on Sept 18th on flight JQ 508 was the best landing I've encountered. The only negative is that Jetstar seems to always be chronically late of advertised takeoff times. Don't know why and don't know if its the companies fault or just airport overload as they are not alone with this constant problem at Sydney and Melbourne.,0
2014,My wife and I booked business class Jetstar from Brisbane to Denpasar. Business is little better than economy with the seats in front dropping back into our laps - very little room. Worse was the return flight which Jetstar cancelled a few hours before departure. The email told us to phone an Australian customer service number (our cost) and we were told we had been moved to business on Virgin the following afternoon. When we checked in at Virgin we were told Jetstar had downgraded us to economy. After much argument with the Jetstar representative at the airport where the only options offered were to fly to Perth or Sydney they magically found two business class seats on that night's flight direct to Brisbane. We had to sit around at the airport for 10 hours. This was the first and last time I will fly Jetstar. My advice to fellow travellers is never fly Jetstar. Their client service is appalling and I got less than no value from being a business class passenger.,1
2014,Booked and confirmed to travel BNE-CNS-NRT 27 August 2014 and NRT-CNS-BNE 09 Septermber 2014. Jetstar cancelled the flight 27 August and without consultation re-booked us to travel 29 August. After requesting what other options were available a flight on 26 August was offered. Since we had accommodation sightseeing and a cruise confirmed 29 and 26 August were not acceptable to us. Knowing that Jetstar operated out of the Gold Coast I requested that we be transferred to fly OOL-NRT 29 August. The inflight crew on the outbound flight were mostly foreign and very professional and friendly. Food service was OK. On the return flight the food was inedible. The aircraft operating this service is the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The only dream we had was to be able to get out of our seats. Once the seats in front were reclined it was impossible to get out. The recline came back to the level of the armrest preventing one to stand up. The only way to exit the seat is to swing ones legs over the armrest into the aisle. If sitting in the centre of three one has to be dragged out.,1
2014,I was flying Jetstar domestically from Adelaide to Brisbane and I only had carry on bags. My bag was only slightly overweight and not only did they make me check my bag in but they charged me an extra fee of $70 despite the fact that I didn't have $70 at the time.,1
2014,We booked a holiday deal to the Hayman Islands for travel between 6/9 - 9/9. We arrived at the airport on time to check-in as their mobile check-in services were down. We were advised by a very rude staff claiming the service counter closed ages ago meaning they decided to close their counter earlier. We showed him we had sufficient time to check-in but he ignore us and denied boarding. We have no choice but to transfer our ticket the next flight on the following day for $50pp losing one night hotel stay and half day on the island. Both the airport staff and call center service was appalling. No consideration or sympathy whatsoever. Will never fly with them again.,1
2014,Flew CNS-BNE return over weekend. (6-7 September). I booked Jetstar due the the cheap flights on offer. I purchased a bundle which came with a food voucher and choice of seat and QFF and was happy with the value. Big points on being able to order hot food now (ham and cheese toastie or pieface box). Check in times were satisfactory. Staff were friendly. Nothing exceptional but more then adequate. I would love to see the food menu extended even if I have to pre-order prior to boarding. Seat pitch okay but a bit confining when the seat in front reclined but again budget airline so it is what it is.,0
2014,JQ 17 MEL-HKT in brand new 787.Business class but seats more like QF premium economy. Departure delayed 90 mins due to tech problem with rear door and storms closing airport. Kept well informed by flight deck. Service by cabin crew very good. Food was pretty good and more than enough for 8/9 hours flight.,0
2014,Daytime flight to Bali. Straight after lunch they turned all the lights off? When asked for a drink (just one) the flight attendant seemed like it was a chore! But they weren't busy as three of them were chatting in the galley. Business Class was much like 'cattle' Class. No leg room. The man in front of me reclined right back leaving me with no room. When my husband had to go to the bathroom he had to ask the man in front of me to push his seat back up so he could get past ! We know that it is not Jetstar's fault that this man reclined but in a normal business class seat you would still have room to get past.,1
2014,Singapore to Darwin. Jetstar flies out of Singapore at 11.30pm so an overnight flight into Darwin. Flight full managed to score exit row seats for myself and partner for $32 each. Able to use Singapore Qantas Club which was very nice and virtually empty. Having something to eat and drink earlier at hotel then QC Club no need to eat on plane used $10 voucher for bottle of water and wine. Uneventful flight on time only glitch was check-in at Singapore where one person was on though others turned up eventually but don't see why people have to wait because others are disorganised. Still prefer full-service I'm afraid.,1
2014,Flew Darwin to Singapore my first time flying Jetstar. Plane is an Airbus 320 leaves Darwin just after 6am. Check-in was fine no delays. Able to use Qantas Club before boarding though QC at Darwin currently being renovated so food limited and no coffee. Comfort on plane ok better than I thought used $10 voucher to purchase sandwich and bottle of water. Chicken sandwich awful flight made up half an hour staff fine. I'm afraid I prefer full service and have everything included plus decent food. Fare was $200 return including QF points and voucher.,1
2014,MEL-DPS DPS-MEL. Good business class fare. Had an equipment swap MEL-DPS to an A330 which was a little disappointing but still comfy for the 6 hour flight. IPAD entertainment is annoying but we were 1A and !B and used the bassinet to mount them on not much selection in way of movies. Staff really efficient and friendly food excellent massive improvement Jetstar. DPS-MEL B787 really nice plane staff and service just as good 2 hour delay due to late arrival from MEL. Will definitely fly again for the right price and schedule. If they only improved the on time performance.,0
2014,"We have just travelled to Hawaii on Jetstar and it was a nightmare from the start. At Melbourne airport we waited almost 2 hours at the check-in desk even though we had done ""so called online check in"". When I told the girl at the desk she told me I was lucky - some people wait 3 hours. Then we waited almost 2 hours on board to get anything to eat or drink because we had not paid the outrageous fee for meals! Since being in Hawaii I have spoken to several of my compatriots who swear they will never travel Jetstar again. Personally I am dreading the return trip to Melbourne on Friday morning. So much for Qantas Frequent Flyer card which I have had for 20 years. A very dissatisfied customer.",1
2014,17/8/2014 JQ960 ADL-CNS and 24/8/2014 JQ963 CNS-ADL. Both flights were very pleasant. The cabin was very clean. Check in staff both friendly and polite in Adelaide and Cairns. Welcomed aboard both flights by friendly crew. Flight attendants were polite friendly and very helpful. Service was excellent. Seats were comfortable and food very nice. This is the only direct service to Cairns from Adelaide and Jetstar have nailed it. This is a low cost carrier but by far the best in Australia.,0
2014,We flew Jetstar to Singapore as Qantas no longer flies from Perth on 8 August. The flight was due to leave at 00.05am and we were dropped off at the airport at 9.45pm. It was not until we arrived at the desk that we found out the flight had been delayed until 10.55am and all we were offered was a food voucher. We were not notified of any changes via email or SMS event hough the airline had both. Another couple had driven for 3 hours to get to the airport and therefore had to find accommodation overnight. If we wish to use our points to go overseas we have to fly Jetstar. Come on Qantas pick up your game for Perth or you will lose all customers. We are looking at using our points and going to another company.,1
2014,My wife and I flew starclass / business from Melbourne to Bangkok return.it was much better than we had expected cannot see what people complain about if they had the same service as we did. You are not paying several thousands return on these flights so what you receive is very good value for money from Jetstar. We have already booked one way flights from Honolulu to Brisbane after a cruise next year in star class and we are looking forward very much to that flight. Inflight and ground crews were all very good.,0
2014,MEL-BKK in economy. Booked Jetstar on this route a number of months ago as it was advertised on their website as B787 Dreamliner service. Received an email from Jetstar two weeks before the flight informing about 'schedule change' which should've read 'equipment change' as they substituted A330 Nightmareliner service instead. Typical Jetstar lack of truth in advertising and false information provided at booking. With two weeks notice this was not maintenance related but rather it was planned. No refund offered despite the B787 being the only reason I booked. The flight itself was typical Jetstar. $46 for my checked bag $20 for an 'up front' seat $59 for the 'plus' package etc. Nickeled and dimed to death. Old plane poor condition little legroom completely inadequate IFE with mind numbing looping of inane videos on circa 1990s monitors throughout cabin. On balance overpriced for what it is which is the core Jetstar problem. On the positive side the all Thai crew was warm friendly efficient and professional.,1
2014,"I flew 4 times in two weeks with this airline. Narita to Cairns Cairns to Sydney Sydney to Melbourne Melbourne to Japan. At Narita Airport the staff were friendly I would expect nothing less in Japan. Australia is where the drop in service is found. The first few flights were fine. Staff seemed a bit unfriendly. Melbourne was a whole other story. Ticket counter staff: The staff were chatting with each other and did not notice me standing in the economy line. The girl took my passport without a greeting and continued talking to her co-worker. In a condescending tone said ""You know this flight is 2 hours late right?"" Never an apology for the inconvenience. I was given my ticket with no explanation about where the gates were or how to handle this delay. I decided to wait at the gate and get information there. The 11pm flight now said 1.30 departure with ""Closed"" next to it. I had no idea what this meant and other customers seemed confused as well. My ticket said 12.30 boarding in pen so I just waited. At 12.45 a gate staff member came to the gate but made no announcements. At 12.50 we find out they will start boarding at 110 once the plane has been deplaned. Boarding: The female gate attendant at least said thank you to each customer the male said nothing. Just scanned all of the boarding passes like a robot. I was surprised they never checked our passports even though it was an international flight. Flight: The flight had about 100 people. The airplane could probably hold about 340 people. Still all the customers were assigned seats right next to each other. The flight crew announced that ""You may notice how empty the flight is. Please wait until we are in the air to choose new seats."" Once we were on the plane the pilot needed to get the weights and the flight crew needed to remember where meal customers were seated so they prohibited seat changing. Very poor customer service by airport staff! Flight: The seats were actually very comfortable. My intention was to sleep through the flight. Unfortunately my ticket said meal on it unbeknownst to me so 2 hours into my sleep the flight attendant jabbed my arm to wake me up and give me the food. Her exact words? ""You ordered the meal."" As we were landing the flight crew (not the pilot) made an announcement to thank us for flying and finally apologized for the delayed time. All in all - not the best experience. The food was good. The IPAD rental is ridiculously expensive and from what I heard doesn't offer a lot of selection. The flight attendants seems rushed or irritated when they did their jobs. The ticket staff were unfriendly. I'll fly Jetstar for the price but never for the service.",1
2014,Flew JQ946 Melb-Cairns on a weekday service. The check-in at Tullamarine is a bit chaotic and could be made a lot simpler with a couple of decent signs. The flight was on time and the crew cheerful and efficient. The range of movies on the in flight paid-for iPad was very limited and not really worth the money. The luggage arrived quickly after arrival in Cairns. Overall value for money.,0
2014,"I was supposed to fly out yesterday on JQ37 unfortunately they cancelled the flight due to ""engineering requirements"". They didn't let me know in advance I didn't find out until I was dropping my bag in. I was given the option of trying again in 24 hours or take a refund and try another airline. Being late in the afternoon I had no other option but to cancel my trip. I wouldn't fly with Jetstar. I would strongly discourage anyone from flying with them if punctuality is important to you. It surprises me they are three stars. Frankly for no showing of flights they should barely be one star.",1
2014,This was the first time I have travelled on Jetstar and since Qantas does not fly from Perth to Singapore I thought I would give Jetstar a try. What a great mistake that was! Yes I understand it is a budget airline but there was no service at all when they delayed the flight for more than 12 hours! I got to the airport about three hours in advance when ground staff said one can check in only two hours prior. An hour passed and when I approached them again to find out the flight had been delayed until the following morning at 4.40am and passengers would be able to collect a meal voucher worth SD$8.00 and that was it. We could not check in until 6pm. The least Jetstar can offer is some bottled water and increase the meal voucher which is less than Aus$10. To hang around with luggage for so many hours at terminal 1 is not fun at all and an inconvenience. Almost all the passengers said they will never fly with Jestar which I think is sad just because the management cannot be bothered to show that they actually care about their passengers.,1
2014,JQ415 OOL-SYD Airbus A320. Great end to our holiday with Jetstar. We arrived at the airport early enough to get transferred from JQ417 (departed at 13.30) to JQ415 (departed at 12.20) free of charge. Leather seats were comfortable however we didn't get to choose seats free of charge when booking. The staff were pretty friendly and the food/beverages and entertainment was good.,0
2014,"JQ 29 MEL-BKK Business Class. Boarding: There was a business class first call. However despite 2 doors economy marched through the business cabin. It is an economy airline. No great fuss and we were up and away. On the plane: After some tine refreshments were served and cleared. Up in the air: Orders taken for meals and immigration cards out and with no great rush a hot towel arrived. Cruising: Drink served and soon the meal which was pretty good appeared. Cheese and wafers and fruit and a glass of lovely Rutherglen muscadelle were great. Inflight service: Once ""service"" is over staff become very scarce and those who are about do not overtly seek eye contact. However a walk into the galley is greeted warmly and efficiently for any small request. Inflight crew: The captain and second were good on announcements and I look forward to having them up front again. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous but you felt that was the extent of the service offering. I was sitting next to an off duty staff member and was not greeted with a hello or any form of inquiry as to my flight for the duration of the flight. I suppose that is what separates the great airlines from the good airlines? If you love your product or just go to work is demonstrated by behaviours not platitudes of company jingles. Overall: Great plane and cabin and faultless service for most part. For the money Royal B and China E and Air Asia are strong competitors but there is a certain Aussy feel good on board especially with the majority Thai staff. In summary: Not a pretender a solid contender but could be be a class leader.",0
2014,BKK-MEL Star Class. 4 hours delay from BKK but staff handled the delay in a professional way. Seat wide and good legroom and recline food delicious and managed to get some sleep. Overall very satisfied.,0
2014,Hobart-Sydney on the evening service. Check-in was quick and easy. Was offered exit row seating (at no extra charge) and accepted gladly. This makes a huge difference. Seats are not the most comfortable but what can one realistically expect on a budget airline? Departed slightly early and arrived earlier. Baggage was on the carousel when we got to it. Ground and cabin crew were delightful.,0
2014,We flew with Jetstar last week and it was the worst flight I have taken. We were coming home from Phuket arrived at the airport to be told our flight was canceled! No email no SMS letting us know. We flew to Singapore (which was scheduled). To be passed from one queue to another where no one seemed to know what was going on. To cut a long story short it took us 30 hrs to get home to Melbourne via Perth (with a further 3hr wait) to eventually be put on a Qantas flight. Do yourself a favour and do not fly internationally with Jetstar.,1
2014,"Flight from Sydney to Phuket on a ""Dreamliner"". Typical Jetstar. An hour late leaving after already changing the schedule a few weeks before. Gave the usual lame excuses. I decided on this flight as it was direct. There were cheaper options but this was more convenient. The seats are definitely more comfortable than their older planes. They can't bring themselves to actually give you anything - not even a cup of tea on a 9 hour ride. It's a nickel and dimes show always. I paid quite a bit for their ""entertainment"" package but this was a rip off. Not much on offer. You would be better off loading up a few sticks and bringing your laptop or iPad. If I could have avoided them I would have but the choices are limited and they are not cheap tickets.",1
2014,"I have travelled from Bangkok to Melbourne on 10/07 with the new Boeing 787 JQ30. I have never experienced such poor seat design and configuration in my life leg room is non-existent if you drop something on the floor you can not pick it up. Width of the seats is such that you have to keep your hands in your lap at all times. Seats can barely recline. I'm not a big person. They crammed 340 passengers on this plane which normally carries 250 people with other airlines. I will never fly with this company again and I highly recommend to all other travellers to avoid flying with them no matter how the cheap fares are. Such a waste of a ""Dreamliner"".",1
2014,I flew from Melbourne to Phuket on the new Dreamliner Star Class. The business class on the 787 is the exact seats on the Qantas A380 Premium Economy and the food of Qantas Domestic Business Class but better! The food was fantastic and the entertainment was good. Since I'm a Qantas Club member I got lounge access at both Ports so no Max Bundle needed. I was travelling with my wife and child. The overall price for all 3 of us return was only $3700! Because we needed baggage we needed to select the max bundle in economy and that added up to $4100. I couldn't believe that I was flying business class cheaper. Flight was good and the Australian Singaporean and Thai crew were excellent! One thing was that the boarding was from the front door so all the economy passengers were just looking at us like 'why would you pay that money?',0
2014,Jetstar positions itself as a discount airline in Asia. I would rate this airline as the worst in the world. The service is pathetic. Check-in slow. Every time I have flown the flight has been late. Today the flight is 7 hours late. There is no recognition of Qantas platinum frequent flier status at check-in. No priority baggage. Extra fees for seat selection and charges for bags. If I had been on any other airline I would have received at least some courtesies as a frequent customer. I have been trying to upgrade my Tokyo to Melbourne flight for two months. I booked through Qantas. When trying to upgrade Jestar says you need Qantas to upgrade the flight. But Qantas says they cannot access Jetstar a system because it's a different airline - so upgrade with jetstar. On the flight the entertainment system is very poor. The food awful. I flew business class from Melbourne to Bangkok. The food was terrible. My seat would not recline properly. In truth - it's like flying a 1980s business class seat. And the planes feel about the same.,1
2014,Recently flown with Jetstar to a number of destinations and can only offer praise for the ground staff and flight crew. I require special assistance and they made sure I received all the help I needed were friendly and efficient. The flight experience was a pleasure. The only drawback with Jetstar is the add-ons when you purchase your ticket. Add on baggage. Add on insurance. Add on donation. Add on seating allocation. Add on forward seats. Add on extra leg room. Add on carbon offset. And the worst is the booking fee they slug you with at the end which can be up to or more than $34. Ouch! Overall I would recommend Jetstar on the basis of good service for short haul flights. Just watch out for those extras.,0
2014,Sydney-Darwin red eye flight. Paid for exit row seats which were worth it for the extra leg room. Staff were kind and the flight landed on time so no complaints aside from the annoyance that the head rests aren't adjustable.,0
2014,Sydney to Honolulu in business class on A330. Check in was quick and efficient although disappointed no priority baggage for business. We didn't take the upsell option with Qantas lounge access as gold Qantas FF so had access in any case. Product is closer to premium economy as is price and evaluation should consider this as noted many otter compare to full service airlines business products. The seat was ok comfortable but any overnight flight will always be hard. Perhaps better quality pillow and blankets would help. Food was good soy glazed chicken with noodles and vegetables. Chicken very tender and noodles more tasty than they looked. Vegetables were overlooked. Standout was cherry tomato and basil soup. What I liked was they took food and drink order before take off so getting drink after seatbelt sign off pretty quick. Crew very friendly especially cabin manager. Nice wine selection. Price difference between Jetstar and Qantas whose business product on 767 for route closer to domestic mean Jetstar very good option. IFE options poor bring own iPad.,0
2014,Returned from Hobart Sunday 6/7 on the 10.30am flight. Stood in a queue for more than 50 minutes to get bags checked in. This is very poor service Jetstar.,1
2014,JQ 29 MEL-BKK on B787. First trip on the 'Dreamliner' which might as well be named 'Nightmareliner'. I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner. Wouldn't go out of my way to fly either Jetstar or their B787.,1
2014,I flew from Sydney to Townsville yesterday with my husband. When we arrived at Sydney Airport we were a bit discouraged to see an extremely long queue at the Jetstar check in counter but to our surprise the queue moved very quickly and we were in line for less than 15 minutes. We checked in with no dramas and we boarded and flew out exactly on time. Once seated however I discovered that a mother and two young children aged around 4 and 6 years were seated behind me and the youngest child started to kick the back of my seat pull the tray up and down and make a fair amount of noise bickering with the other child. I put up with it until after takeoff before getting the attention of a flight attendant. I explained the situation to her quietly so as not to offend anyone and we were moved to a seat at the back of the plane immediately no questions asked. I can appreciate that it is difficult for children to sit still when flying but I was not looking forward to having my seat kicked for 2.5 hours and I was grateful that flight staff on Jetstar were able to move us quickly and without fuss. The entire flight went smoothly after that and the flight crew were very friendly and attentive throughout. I believe that we got excellent value for money for our flight and I was more than happy with the service provided.,0
2014,Singapore to Ho Chi Minh return A320. Group check in was fairly quick. Short flight so no IFE and no food was not a problem. Early arrival in HCM meant a wait for an available parking space (not really the airline's fault). Crew really observant during take-off and landing which is good. Very cheap prices and will not hesitate to fly Jetstar again for short flights.,0
2014,We had to fly to Singapore from Auckland and we needed a direct flight. I am very pleased with the airline it was an agreeable surprise. I knew it is a budget Airline so I booked the bundles and was prepared for the worst but it turned out to be a pleasant experience and I must say that the personnel on the ground and in the air were most friendly and professional. Sure you don't get free alcohol drinks or free food but this is why they can offer cheap flights! You can always buy your own food and bring it onboard! All in all I can recommend this airline.,0
2014,Recently traveled Brisbane-Bali on the new Dreamliner in Business Class. Overall was a great experience and would highly recommend. It is the same style seat as domestic business class which was fine for a 6 hr flight. Meals Drinks and Entertainment all included all for a low fare of $1500 for 2 people return so this cannot be compared to a full service airline like many people do. Friendly Staff and modern entertainment. Highly recommend if you can get a great price like we did.,0
2014,12 June 2014. JQ 30 BKK-MEL. Business seat 1 F Boeing 787-8. First flight on a 787 and booked my normal 1F. At check in advised it was one 1 E. Due to language difficulties I could not understand why and my request for an explanation was polite but I was not able to master the meaning. I was informed it was a window seat so proceeded to the aircraft. I was then advised that I was in the second row. The reason I fly in row one is for the legroom and lack of a seat in my face for 9 hours making laptop use at times impossible. Again the explanation was difficult to understand and upon my insistence I eventually got back into 1F. It appears the IFE was U/S in seat 1F and the crew were trying to assist me. Lived without IFE. Food and service very good from an all Thai crew which is becoming the norm on this leg and JQ 29. Big drawback with the 787 in seat 1F is that the galley access is out of alignment with the seat so approximately one foot of the space in front of the seat is in line with the open galley. This means when the crew make their multiple visits the curtain hits the passengers legs. This could be some what alleviated with a retainer lower down the curtain. So for 787 flights I advise I will be sitting in 1B or 1J which are out of the way of the traffic flow by about 4 inches. The seats were reasonably comfortable with reasonable recline but footrests need improving as the rung like support is intrusive. Plane new and clean as you would expect. PA from flight deck was nearly indecipherable. This is a safety issue that needs attending to. The headset issued now has a 3 pin plug and subjectively the headsets don't seem as noise cancelling as the ones on the A330. A pity my Bose were in checked luggage as the 3 pin plug would not worth the headset with my phone or Ipad so no IFE and no music. Not the end of the world but an opportunity for better communication with customers one would have thought.,0
2014,"Darwin - Sydney 9 June. A320. 2 PAX. Given it was a ""red-eye"" special with 0200 hrs departure for a low cost carrier this was a pleasant flight. Airport Counter check-in staff helpful and efficient. A request for exit row seats was granted without fuss or attempts of extortion for more money. Flight departed early arrived on time. Cabin temperature suitable for relaxed sleeping and managed to get 3 hrs sleep. Crew professional. Tickets were purchased 6 months in advance and for the cost of $109 pp - it really was excellent value for a flight duration of 4.5 hours.",0
2014,Flight JQ 151 SYD to CHC. 5th June 2014. Travelling as a group of 4 3 names were on the manifest and 1 was not. Despite showing the loading attendant our confirmation for the passenger she showed absolutely no concern and would not make any further enquires. The result was that we had to fly on leaving our friend to sort things out in Sydney. This he did and it was found to be a Jetstar error. The rudeness and total unhelpfulness of the person in charge of the boarding gate shows just why this airline continues to rank amongst the top of the list of unpopular airlines. Never again Jetstar.,1
2014,Melbourne to Phuket new dreamliner. As soon as I walked onto the dreamliner I wanted to get off the seat pitch and size of the seats was so tight. I could find nothing positive about this new aircraft maybe a little quieter. Ready for take off pushed backed then stopped captain said it would only be ten minutes turned out to be almost two hours sitting on the plane before take off. Return flight one hour late in taking off. Thank goodness they changed the aircraft from the 787 to the airbus (more room). All up I would not choose to fly the 787 again for any thing more 5 hours due to fact of bad leg room and small seats.,1
2014,"Melbourne to Coolangatta flight was to leave Melbourne at 10.10 - at 9.45 advised there would be an hour delay after an hour we were told flight still delayed and no definite time of departure waiting on engineer! Finally at 2.00pm we boarded the flight and after 10 mins told ""sorry same problem again"" and we all had to go back into terminal while they prepared another plane. I was travelling with my elderly mother and those stairs are killers. Our flight finally left Melbourne at 3.00pm arriving Coolangatta at 5.00pm. This ruined our afternoon of prepared travel & our holiday in general. Flew home Tiger with no problems.",1
2014,What a terrible excuse for an airline. My daughter was in Australia for 4 months in a study abroad program and as we live in Hawaii I made the mistake of booking Jetstar to Honolulu as it was the only nonstop from Sydney. I purchased their max. checked baggage allowance of 40Kg (wouldn't let me buy more) although I thought she might be slightly over since basically every other airline allows two fifty lb bags to be checked they cap it at two 44 lb bags. She was 4 kg total over at check in and they told her she would need to pay $25 per kg. I told her to start dumping things in front of the check in desk. She was on a half full flight and 4kg was going to matter? They also weigh purses as part of this luggage scam because you are only allowed 10kg carried on. If you are overweight they probably make you run laps until the plane boards.,1
2014,PER-DPS. The last three flights I have taken from PER-DPS I have paid extra for the 9.30a.m. flight. Not once have I flown at that time. They reschedule me to the 7.30am flight which was a cheaper flight. Now I just found out that the flight I booked PER-DPS has also been changed. I paid extra to fly out of DPS at 12.30p.m. and now have been rescheduled to the 10.30p.m. flight which on booking was much cheaper. I will never book with Jetstar again. Not only to they constantly re- schedule you they do not refund the extra money you have paid. Be aware when you book a certain time you are probably not going to fly at that time.,1
2014,Flew on a short flight from Sydney to Ballina. We were on one of the older planes with very small leg room. Seats didn't recline and uncomfortable journey. Service was average nothing to note about. The return flight was much better on the new aircraft. Better comfort and leg room. Service the same.,1
2014,We flew Jetstar Perth-Singapore-Hong-Kong and back in August / September 2013. All aspects of the check-ins and flights were good and no problems. The cost of the flights to and from HK were exceptional value. I read reports about the lack of on- board services - take your own water/food and in-flight entertainment along and you will have nothing to complain about. We regularly fly Jetstar and have never had a problem.,0
2014,Ballina-Melbourne on A320. Paid about $100 or so for a one way ticket which I purchased on Qantas website . Baggage allowance was 20kg and there was no detail on the QF website about incremental charges for excess baggage. Travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg - ie: 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. Jetstar charged me $300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. Qantas should be reprimanded for selling Jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and Jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesn't remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. Qantas customer service people in Melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a Jetstar issue (even though JQ is owned by QF and the ticket was bought on the QF website). Jetstar employees in Melbourne were unsympathetic said I should've known read the policies etc. One even suggested they should be charging more and didn't think $500-1000 was out of line. This airline is completely out of control and I vow never to reward either company with my business again.,1
2014,I have flown with them 4 times recently for 3 work meetings and 1 weekend trip. On each occasion my flight schedule was changed at the very last minute usually by 4+ hours. One change even involved me having to swap a direct flight for one with a layover in Bali with 1 day's notice. This flight was again changed on the evening before the flight. On arrival in Singapore for a connecting flight to Bali I discovered my luggage had been completely destroyed due to a heavy oil leak (not from within my bag) and having been crushed by other heavy luggage. The call centres could not be more unhelpful if they were staffed by a group of chimpanzees with typewriters.,1
2014,My wife and I flew Melbourne to Christchurch on Sunday May 4th JQ 171 Airbus 320. Left Melbourne on time arrived 10 minutes early. Plane clean good attendants nothing to complain about. Will fly Jetstar again in November Auckland to Christchurch.,0
2014,Used Jetstar from Bangkok to Singapore 4x in the last 3 months and everything went like clock work. Online reservations easy and rates better than competition especially last moment purchase check in a breeze new clean planes and great crew comfortable seating with actual leg room. All flights on time and all landed ahead of schedule. Definitely will use them and prefer them to others like AirAsia that is becoming a true cattle mover.,0
2014,My wife 3 children and I flew from Honolulu to Melbourne just under an 11 hour flight. No mention of needing to pre-book ipads. The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers? Apparently not.,1
2014,Flew their Singapore to Cambodia new service back in February. Check-in tried to charge us for excess luggage on the way back after we had paid for 30 kg already. Tried it on the couple in front of us also. Luckily we had our original online bookings done via Qantas docs printed with us. Our friends on the earlier flight during the week were made to re-check their luggage in Singapore but we were not also another level of inconsistency. Fly Silk is my advice until they have got their act together or fail which may not be far off looking at the way they seem to be going. Sadly we thought it was Emirates but it must have been a shared flight with Qantas. Oh well never again sorry Qantas.,1
2014,Flying on A320 Sharklet from SYD to ADL JQ764. Cabin is a bit aged but clean and crews are friendly. A little delay due to a technical fault on the ancillary generator on the rear but the Captain recovered the lost time during the flight. Seat is more comfortable and spacious compare to Qantas 737-800 which I took on my return flight.,0
2014,Although I fly 50000+ miles a year around Asia I'd never flown on Jetstar before (flight was booked by a travel agent without any further info). I flew on 2 May from Perth to Bangkok. The trouble was I took an aspirin 10 minutes after takeoff and asked for a water. I was told it cost $4 cash. All I had was my ATM card. Four dollars: for a bottle of water on a 5 hour flight. Then I noticed I was sitting on a stripped Airbus that could easily pass for a re-purposed 1971 Trailways bus. No video entertainment zero amenities - 5 hours with nothing to do. I am sure Jetstar would install pay toilets if they could. Flying Jetstar left me with a renewed appreciation for Thai Airways and KAL. I will make it a point to specifically avoid Jetstar in the future at all costs which has easily been the worst experience I've had flying in decades.,1
2014,Jetstar Airways isn't a budget carrier in terms of the price they charge. It cost my group members over $800 each to fly from Singapore to Hangzhou when tickets on full-fledge flights with meals refreshments and entertainment on other airlines like SIA and Cathay Pacific can cost less. It's 'budget' quality in seats with very narrow leg space so the flight attendants insisted that all hand carry had to be stored in the overhead compartments. Problem is that all the compartments near our seats were full with the crew's and other passengers luggage. There didn't seem to be restrictions on the size and the number of hand-carry passengers could bring on the plane. A crew member offered to squeeze my backpack into a compartment that was far from my seat. As I had my passport and money in it it refused to have it out of my sight. I had a most uncomfortable trip with the bag in front of me and hardly any room to stretch my legs. Will never take Jetstar again - not when I can get better service at a lower cost on a regular flight.,1
2014,Phuket to Melbourne. 787 Dreamliner. Had flown on Qatar's 787 Business Class so had high expectation leading into this flight and was disappointed. Seat 1F - which was in a row of 3 when I checked in on-line the seats next to me were free but at check-in they agent advised these seats were now taken. I had asked if I could move to 3G/H but was told these were reserved for crew! I had read online that these were the best seats with more recline what's the point of having them if they are only for crew - seems pointless! Seat config of 2-3-2. For business class I don't understand the point of a row of 3 seats. Seat comfort was ok but impossible to sleep in. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Dinner was ok - Soup for starter which was tasteless Main was very tasty which was stir fry steak. Was accompanied with a 'salad' which was a couple of lettuce leaves in a bowl. Wine choice good. Entertainment system ok - had a couple of new release movies and some recent TV shows but quite limited. Overall it was good value for money but I'd hardly call this Business Class. I don't see why Jetstar wouldn't invest in putting in slightly bigger seats with more recline especially when the majority of their flights on the way back to Australia are red eye and the current seats are impossible to sleep in comfortably.,0
2014,Relocating to New Zealand so had excess luggage. Had called Jetstar twice before travel to check the cost and on both occasions was told $15 per kg. At check-in was charged $25 per kg and was told that $25 per kg is the international excess baggage charge regardless of destination. The excess baggage cost more than the actual flight ticket. Check-in staff could not care less that we were given incorrect information over the phone (twice!). Poor customer service and unethical business practices in my opinion.,1
2014,Flight JQ151 SYD to CHC on 12th March - seats 5 A and B. Great check in at SYD polite and friendly staff no queues and all done with smiles and a minimum of fuss. Two bags checked in and no issues with weight or size though one was on the button and the other just under. Flight on time and the seat next to us was free bonus. The cabin manager was on his game polite friendly welcoming and very smartly turned out. The other crew equally so and the atmosphere on board was one of calm and professionalism. Smooth take off not a word from the Captain but prompt service one we levelled off and again swift friendly and professional. Given the hour of the flight the Cabin Manager was smart enough to realize that most people were wanting to doze and there was minimum noise and disruption from the crew in respect to announcements or endless trips up and down the aisle as sometimes mysteriously happens on night flights. Arrived early into Christchurch and left the aircraft with a heartfelt thanks from the crew and a cheery good night. Great flight from Jetstar - this is our fifth International service and all are up there with the mainline carriers at about a quarter of the price.,0
2014,When I eventually get into my seat I'll leave another review but that's not for another 2 hours just a minor 7.5 hour delay. What is so spectacularly unacceptable was the lack of timely/accurate information so now we have wasted a day here in Melbourne and lost a precious day of our holiday. We chose Jetstar as it flies direct from Melbourne to Honolulu rather than Qantas which goes via Sydney to save 4 hours. Foolish us.,1
2014,Yes you may save money on the airfare but it is so not worth the saving to suffer through one of their flights in my opinion. If you get a basic ticket no food or drink apart from a small bottle of water is provided and it was freezing cold in the cabin and cost something like $20 to use a blanket for the trip. Never again will I fly Jetstar I have sworn except if it is to Phuket which at the moment seems to be the only airline that goes there directly from Sydney. You get what you pay for with Jetstar! I flew Sydney to Bangkok return.,1
2014,Recently travelled from Brisbane to Launceston and over the past 4 months I have made many return trips due to my moving. The flight times are very convenient and all but one flight was on time with departure and sometimes early on arrival. One flight was 25 minutes late due to weather which is of no consequence. All aircraft's were clean and cabin crew were fine. Several times I had emergency exit seats offered which I accepted and have no complaint with my treatment. I don't usually purchase food as I am sure I can survive for 2.5 hrs. The fares were all cheap easy to book and are good value. As always you get what you pay for. I rarely take luggage so the fare structure suits me and I always pay via Direct Debit to save on Credit Card Fees. One of my return trips via Melbourne was actually with Parent Company Qantas and this flight was nowhere near as pleasant as the Jetstar flights. Its just a shame that I see poor behaviour on these flights from fellow passengers over fairly minor problems.,0
2014,MEL-SIN-MEL with Jestar along with some intra asia flights. On the outbound it was on a newer A330 which had the seat back AVOD. Had pre-booked meals and the I have to say it was the best inflight meal I have ever had (spicy Chicken with rice). The seat next to me was empty so comfort was quite good as I got to stretch out a bit. All intra Asia flights were pretty good but nothing more than what was expected i.e. got me to where I was going! Inbound flight did not have the seat back AVOD and have to say that I got a sore neck by the end of the flight as the Ipad has to sit on the tray table which is at an uncomfortable height. Flight attendants on all flights were nice and always willing to help. All in all I will be flying again with Jestar as they get me where I am going and at a good price.,0
2014,Flew Melbourne to Bangkok in Business class. We've flown Business Class with 5 other much more costly carriers in the past. Got to say we were very impressed with Jetstar. The cabin staff were the friendliest and most attentive! The service faultless. The food was great I had a black pepper steak with fried rice and steamed greens. The wines 4 selections were acceptable and they weren't stingy about top ups. They give you iPad's for the entertainment which with the superb headphones was good listening. The only downside is that the iPad adds to the limited space available on your tray come meal time. Would definitely fly with them again and the savings made mean Suite upgrades at the destination.,0
2014,Denpasar to SYD 787 Dreamliner. Was sent an email offering paid upgrade to business class so couldn't refuse. Seats comfortable (although didn't fully recline) entertainment good service excellent. The 787 Dreamliner is so smooth you hardly feel it take off or land. Will not refuse to take an upgrade to business offer again.,0
2014,Our first and definitely last ever flight with Jetstar. I write this as I spend over 12 hours at Changi Airport after Jetstar cancelled a flight from Singapore to Perth supposedly due to bad weather in Perth. There is no bad weather in Perth today and other airlines are flying there. We and our fellow passengers believe they have given this excuse to avoid responsibility for passenger accommodation. For this reason we simply will not trust them again. We were warned though so the lesson has been learnt.,1
2014,Flew the new 787 from MEL to AKL and selected the J seat although it was only Y service. Very dirty and grubby plane esp for such a new aircraft (the carpet was appalling). Had flown Jetstar J before and knew what to expect but the seat seemed less comfy but maybe it was my imagination. Service wasn't an issue for us as the flight is only 3 hrs but I have to say that if was crammed into a Y seat for 9 hrs to Asia I would understand how the convicts must have felt coming out to Australia. All in all had low expectations which were met. Did like the 787 as an aircraft and look fwd to seeing them on QF services one day in the future.,1
2014,MEL-HNL return. Return trip was via Sydney. Pre-booked catering and entertainment. Had a spare seat next to me both ways which helped. Seat standard for economy. Ipad entertainment was fine. Food was barely fit for human consumption and not worth a cent - take your own on board. Check in at Melbourne long and arduous and a bad way to start a holiday! Return flight was delayed in both HNL and SYD making for a very long trip.,0
2014,"MEL-HNL-MEL purchased an upgrade to the business class product on outbound. Did not expect anything like business class product on other international carriers so I was not disappointed with the product overall: it is closer to a premium economy product. Food was pretty good wines were fine very limited options on the free iPad but the noise-reducing headphones were great and no complaints about the amenities packet. However the leg room and recline were quite limited and the leg rest on my seat did not work. Chief FA looked at it and pronounced the cable broken ""like lots of these seats"" offered no regrets but pointed to 2 company non-revs in the bulkhead row and asked if I wanted her to go and roust them out so I could sit there. I felt very much put on the spot and declined. Miserable night. I suppose I should have been more assertive. On the inbound: execrable vegetarian food in economy and the seats also busted: no reading light no call bell no expression of regret from cabin staff (and this was an exit row seat for which I had paid extra). A332 on both flights very dirty and shabby. The toilets on both were simply disgusting even at the start of each flight. Many FAs wore dirty or tattered uniforms with buttons missing and frayed hems and cuffs. Of course the ticket was relatively cheap and Jetstar is now the only non-stop between MEL and HNL so one has to hold one's nose and endure. Slipshod rubbish airline even for an LCC.",1
2014,Perth to Sydney on A321. Bargain fare flight on time and crew very pleasant and professional. Only problem was lack of catering. I sat near the front but they had already sold out of most options as passengers on previous flight had bought it. Apparently they do not restock at Perth and the company prefers to sell out (and disappoint customers) rather than carry adequate stocks of food that could be left unsold. Eat before you board!,0
2014,Melbourne to Hobart. Flight was 2 hours late and then left us at the luggage carousel for 45 min waiting for luggage to be unloaded a completely unacceptable performance that caused us to miss the wedding we travelled for and incur additional transport costs. Information flow throughout was poor and inaccurate.,1
2014,Last month was my second flight on Jetstar from Melbourne to Bangkok return. Food and drink both have to be purchased on board or online during booking which is fair enough as it is a cheap airline fare. Leaving Melbourne we were aware of this and took our own sandwiches and bottled water purchased in the Duty Free area at Tullamarine - no problem. On both return journeys - at Bangkok airport - our bags were searched before boarding and all water was confiscated from passengers. Although we could purchase drinks and snacks using a credit card on-board we did not. Surely Jetstar could at least provide free bottled water to dehydrated passengers. Maybe I just expect too much.,1
2014,Flew them between Brisbane - Sydney and Sydney - Gold Coast. Clean aircraft on-time departure. Cabin crew were quite mechanical in their duties. Food items and beverages were available for sale. Their web-site is also quiet user friendly for making reservations. Overall good experience.,0
2014,Flew Jetstar JQ960 from Adelaide to Cairns on February 3. For a (by Australian standards) lengthy domestic flight it was well worth the saving to fly Jetstar. Incredibly attentive crew comfortable seats and iPads available to hire along with the usual food and drink for purchase.,0
2014,Travelled for the first time with Jetstar in January to Launceston. Check in took 50 minutes at Sydney (just as well we were early). When on the plane I had to sit sideways as there was not enough leg room my teenage sons also had the same problem. The lady in front of me tried to recline her seat during the flight but could not because my knee was jammed up against the back of her seat. I had to ask her to stop trying to recline as it was hurting my knees. I Think Jetstar are greedy as they are understaffed and there are too many rows of seats on the plane for people of average size. Next holiday it will be back to Virgin.,1
2014,Jetstar is a low-cost carrier but still they could do a little better in some specific areas to avoid disappointing their customers. For example: I was flying 3K764 KIX-MNL and they offer online check in. But when you get to the airport the special line for online checked in passengers is closed and you have to queue with the regular passengers. The local Jetstar staff doesn't seem to understand the concept of on-line check in and frequent travelers would agree with me that it's quite annoying. The overall friendliness of the onboard staff is average or below average.,0
2014,Perth to Brisbane. Flight cancelled after waiting in the airplane from midnight to 3.30am. Rescheduled for the following day and new delay. Attendants tired and not offering support.,1
2014,"SYD to MEL and back. The flight was fine you don't expect too much on such a short flight. No IFE and food and drink prices were reasonable. I had a coffee which was surprisingly good. The bugbear was the check in. Massive queues at Sydney but moving quickly due to the fully manned bag drops. However in Melbourne for the return two ""jobsworths"" asked where passengers were travelling to and only allowed certain flights to join the queue. Consequently when they did finally condescend to allow us in it was an almighty scramble to get the bag dropped and to the gate before the flight. Really let the airline sown. It wasn't that they were busy just two women exercising their power! That is reason I downmarked the staff service option because cabin crew were great.",0
2014,Flew Melbourne to Phuket on new Dreamliner in Business Class on 9/2/2014. This was such a nice surprise to be on this plane. Even the staff seemed happier. Also the food was of a higher standard than I have had on previous flights. After saying all this there are two areas that need me. One is the cleanliness of the seats. Many were stained and the other is that they do need more choice on the entertainment side.,0
2014,We flew from Melbourne to Denpasar and needed to check one bag. I went to ask how much it would cost at the counter and they said to do it online asap. To book it online the cost is $54 if you didn't see the fine print on the website which only said the cost would be greater at the counter you would have to pay $165. For one bag! On top of that absolutely everything else cost money as well. I had to ask for water. I would rather pay the extra $100 and fly in comfort with a regular airline.,1
2014,Flew BNE to TSV. travelling with special needs passenger boarded first with 3 seats between 2 of us. check in staff were quite rude we had overweight baggage and I was fine with paying this without complaint. Check in lady wrote ticket and just pointed when I ask what the pointing meant was quite rude. The inflight staff were fantastic fun its just the people on the ground who give Jetstar a bad wrap. Flight left on time and arrived early.,0
2014,NTL to MEL 13 Jan. Full aircraft. Counter check-in friendly and accommodating granting 3 of us exit row seats upon request. Aircraft clean seats comfortable for 1.5 hr flight which departed on time. Very smooth flight. Advance purchase of tickets meant that the flight was good value.,0
2014,Melbourne to Singapore. Having read over and over again how bad the budget internationals were I was amazed at the value for money you get when traveling with Jetstar. Sure the food was not 5 star but it was edible the seats were comfortable staff friendly and overall for the price I paid ($324 return) how could you expect more. It amazes me that people whinge about budget airlines and compare them to full cost airlines. Overall very happy.,0
2014,Flew MEL-MCY return on JQ794 11th Jan and JQ793 18th Jan. JQ794 - 11th Jan 2014. Aircraft: A320 VH-VGT. Seat 20F. We had carry on only and we used web check in so we could go straight to the gate no queuing or anything. Flight was on time and aircraft was clean. Seat was adequately comfortable however the legroom was limited it would be a bit uncomfortable on a longer flight. Crew were especially good on this flight very welcoming and helpful. Didn't purchase any food onboard or entertainment onboard - no need to spend the extra $$ on a short flight. Arrived early. JQ793 - 18th Jan 2014. Aircraft A320 VH-VQQ. Seat: 28F. Flight was good seat pretty comfortable more legroom on this older and differently configured aircraft. Once again didn't purchase any food or entertainment. Crew were helpful. Arrived on time. Overall I was very pleased with the service. We just wanted the cheapest fare so we don't care about extras like luggage entertainment food. There was nothing to complain about - Jetstar excelled in every area and I would definitely fly with them again.,0
2014,"Hobart - Melbourne - Perth. Hobart to Tullamarine on a fairly new A320. Aircraft was pretty clean and tidy and me and my wife got our allocated seats. Flight was on time happy to say. JQ968 Tullamarine to Perth was a different story. Check in manager very rude even after I produced my ASIC and advised her that I was fully aware of the conditions of being in an exit row. Inexcusable behaviour. Flight was out on time on a new A320 but I cannot understand the cabin crew. A person should not do a job like this if they are not cut out to do it. Sure the flight was a ""red eye"" and as a frequent flyer I can accept that this can affect your moods. But the fact that one staff member (Cabin Manager) was putting meals on the floor another male member of staff (who conveniently wore no name tag) was slamming around and making as much noise as he possibly could. He was on a mission not to let passengers sleep. And then the lot of them standing there and complaining about their jobs - well you get the picture. Paid a full fare for this flight and in my view if this is the way Jetstar operates their business they do not deserve any of the domestic market. Will never use them again.",1
2014,Flew Jetstar Tokyo to Sydney via gold coast. Flight was delayed by an hour. I tried to buy drinks on the plane and staff rudely informed me that they don't take cash (AUD or JPY) and only credit cards which I didn't have. To be fair the flight was a lot cheaper than any of the other full service airlines but you get what you pay for. Flew back to Tokyo on Air NZ a few weeks later and was amazed at the difference. Chalk and cheese. Seats are uncomfortable and have minimum legroom (even on a large aircraft such as the A330). Cabin crew are rude (and their polyester polo shirt uniforms are awful). Check in staff appear to be overworked. For short haul flights Jetstar are OK but for anything longer than 4 hours your better off going with a full service airline.,1
2014,I have traveled with Jetstar from Perth to Bali and return twice in the last 2 years. Both times were on an Airbus A320. Personally I found the seats in economy class quite OK compared to the economy seats on Qantas and Virgin who use Boeing 737's. Being a low cost carrier I made sure I read the fine print and terms and conditions. Once again as is so true in life you get what you pay for. Budget Airline means no frills and the bare basics unless you want to pay extra. As it is only a 3.5 hour flight I was more than happy to forgo the full services offered in exchange for a much cheaper fare. Both times Jetstar have provided a realistic service for the price paid. Aircraft was clean flight on time and fairly smooth. No real complaints. What I expected was met and I would much rather have the money I saved to spend on my holiday than enjoying all the perks of a full service carrier. Realistically it is only 3.5 hours out of your life! Will happily fly Jetstar again in the future on short haul flights.,0
2014,My flight to Tokyo from MNL Jan 6 was canceled due to hydraulic problem as mentioned by the captain when we are already onboard the plane. They said we will be delayed for an hour but eventually it was canceled and rescheduled the next day. Jetstar accommodated all pax in a five star hotel with free meals so for a budget airline it was very good.,0
2014,In my trip to Japan I decided to fly back to Tokyo from Osaka on Jetstar Japan. Staff at the check-in counter were helpful and friendly. The flight however was delayed for about 20-30 minutes but without any announcement. It was generally good for a short-haul flight domestically in Japan.,0
2014,Flew Sydney to Hobart for a Christmas break. Flights were cheap to buy and they turned out to both be on time so no complaints. Legroom is a bit cramped but for a two hour flight it's reasonable.,0
2014,Flew JQ944 from Melbourne to Cairns then onto Osaka (JQ15 Business class) then Osaka to Fukuoka the next day. Returned on 6th January Fukuoka to Osaka (GK550) then Osaka to Cairns (JQ16 Business Class) Cairns to Melbourne (JQ947). The Japanese legs were fine as was the outbound flights to Japan. Though the return flight from Osaka was average. They forgot my sons meal during dinner service (I had to ask them for it) they did apologise though he ordered chicken and got beef and I said nothing as I figured it was all to much trouble for them. Then the girl going through the cabin offering desert tea and coffee missed us completely. Once again I had to ask. The fight from Cairns started good with a very helpful girl at the counter. Some of the crew were terrible. Then a rather rude women on the crew ordering people to sit down marching up and down the plane and the two crew members sitting down the back during the whole trip gossiping in loud voices. As an Australian it was embarrassing. As a regular flyer I've got to say the service is pretty average and it really is hit or miss. Some staff members are very good while some are woeful. But I guess you pay for what you get.,1
2014,Flew JQ91 ADL-DRW on 25th Dec 2013 and returned on JQ92 DRW-ADL on 29th Dec 2013. Both flights were on time and seats were fine. Entertainment and food were ok - you have to pay for it but for the 3.5 hour flight it is worth it. What really impressed me was the cabin staff especially from DRW to ADL. Our cabin manager was the best I have experienced. Nothing was too much trouble. I have found Jetstar hit and miss in the past. Sydney and Melbourne based crew are generally lifeless and disinterested however Darwin based crew are excellent.,0
2014,Travelled with Jetstar to Phuket because they flew direct. They were not cheaper than other airlines available at the time just the flight times were good. Everything on this flight came with an extra cost. Food drinks entertainment and even a blanket for our daughter who was feeling cold came at an additional cost. I think Jetstar have poor service and are a rip off. I will not fly again or recommend this airline to others.,1
2014,Flew JQ269 AKL-WLG 15 Nov 2013 returned JQ268 WLG-AKL 17 Nov 2013. Cost was $120 return for 2 incl credit card charge. Both flights on time or a little early crew good and efficient plane (A320) clean. In Aus JQ may be hard work but in NZ they seem fine but you must check in on time and be at the gate in plenty of time. We pushed back 10 mins before due time from AKL and from WLG 5 mins ahead of time. I've no issues with them locally and they give Air NZ much needed competition. Compare the rates on the main trunk (AKL-WLG-CHC-ZQN/DUD with provincial eg ROT-CHC that doesn't have competition. Food and beverages and IFE are both extras. We didn't use either but it looked ok. In summary the perfect bus ride on time safe clean and cheap.,0
2014,Sydney-Hobart return - you get what you pay for although with all the add-ons the Jetstar fare isn't any cheaper really than QF or Virgin. The seating is cramped the aircraft was grubby inside tray table had sticky marks on it and the inflight magazines were quite grubby. We were two and a half hours late leaving Hobart with very short notice of delay which meant we had given up our hotel room only to spent mindless hours sitting around Hobart airport. Certainly won't use Jetstar again.,1
2013,OOL-SYD. Booked the 16.00 flight to find when I got to the airport that it was cancelled and I had been moved to the 19.20 flight! Not very helpful with infants. Crew acted like they didn't want to even be there. Food was overpriced and I knew that from my flight there so bought food at the airport for less then half the price. No entertainment offered onboard. Bring your own entertainment. Seat was very uncomfortable. Arrived at 22.00 and airport closing. No staff there to help us. Bags didn't turn up on carousel told our luggage would come with Qantas tomorrow afternoon!,1
2013,Jetstar are in the habit of cancelling flights with little notification time (45mins before flight time via an email) and then abandoning passengers after transferring them to closed airports. Ground staff less than helpful and claimed that this type of service is to be expected from budget carriers. They appear to be over-anticipating passenger demand on some routes and when supply outstrips demand simply cancelling flights and disrupting passengers by either flying them the next day or transferring them to flights to other airports on sister airlines and bussing passengers to their original destination. Totally unacceptable when travelling with children and being left outside a locked airport terminal after an hour long bus transfer at 1.00am.,1
2013,My 70 year old mother flew Jetstar from Hobart to Melbourne and was targeted to weigh her baggage (very small suitcase + handbag) and when it was just over the 10kg limit was told to pay the $70 or leave things behind! No empathy no consideration blunt and rude. Whilst it is ridiculous that you have to weigh both your suitcase and handbag the exorbitant fee and accompanying rude treatment is even worse. The cost for baggage is $10 if you pay prior and $70 if they target you on the day. How they can justify charging 7 times the standard fee? I will never book anyone on Jetstar ever again. Fly at your peril.,1
2013,SIN-SUB-SIN with Jetstar's ValueAir A320 on 2 and 5 Nov '13. Checked in at Changi and Juanda airports were quick since I didn't have any check-in luggage. Furthermore I arrived early so the queue wasn't long. Both flights departed slightly late but arrived on time. I bought neither the foods nor the drinks during the 2.15 hours of flight so I can't comment on that. The crews were ok. Information about the destination was given by the captain just before landing which is standard for any flight. To sum it up it was a quick hassle free flights.,0
2013,Was on service from AKL to CHC with Jetstar. The flight was on time check-in was smooth (SMS boarding pass was a smart choice). Attendants were nice helpful though the flight was literally full. Cannot review the food and entertainment in details as they were not included in the price. For a budget airline it was quite good and enjoyable for me.,0
2013,Flew Melbourne to Bali in business class old plane before they introduce the new planes on the route. Food and drinks were excellent and better than the Qantas domestic offering however please don't scrimp on a proper desert. The current inflight entertainment was limited and I put it away once I looked at the content hopefully new planes have something better. Service was great from the Aussie and Thai crew.,0
2013,Normally reliable however do not use Jetstar to fly to Bali from Darwin. On two occasions the flight has either been extremely delayed or in this case cancelled. There was little communication with passengers the board just switched to a different time which happened to be 5 hours later. All we got was a $50 off our next flight voucher which expires by end of the year.,1
2013,Flew Melbourne to Christchurch and was a horrific experience. Leg room sufficient for people no taller than 5 1/2 foot. Fight was delayed and to top it off I landed in Christchurch 3 days ago yet my luggage still hasn't arrived. Any attempt to deal with their customer services was painful. Don't fly Jetstar unless you want sore legs and a nightmare experience.,1
2013,A recent flight from Auckland to Queenstown with Jetstar was much better than expected. My husband and I were at the airport 2 hours before departure and there was no queue at the check-in desks so we didn't bother with the self-check-in kiosks and went straight to the counter. The check-in agent was all smiles checked in our bags handed us our boarding passes and wished us a pleasant journey. 30 minutes before departure we went though security where there were again no queues and the security agent could not have been more pleasant and even cracked a joke! The flight boarded on time with smiling flight attendants at the gate and at the aircraft door. The cabin of the A320 was clean bright and looked relatively new. We had paid a few extra dollars for extra leg room seats and had plenty of room in the exit row. The flight left on time and it didn't take long for the FAs to get the trolley out. We enjoyed a wine with cheese and biscuits for $10 whilst marvelling at the view below. Throughout the 1hr 45min flight the FAs were friendly down to earth and professional and instead of hiding after service were present throughout and happy to engage in conversation with passengers. We landed in Queenstown exactly on time our luggage was on the belt within 10 minutes and we were in a cab less than 5 minutes later. We were delightfully surprised!,0
2013,AVV-SYD-AVV. Great trip. The plane was new seats clean and flight left on time. Food options were good. Crew were very professional. Quick to board check-in and deplane. Overall great trip and I will fly Jetstar again. Fares were only $35.,0
2013,I will never fly Jetstar again. Our seats tray tables and magazine section were filthy the magazine actually had chewing gum stuck to it the window was filthy. An hour leaving Perth and 1/2 an hour circling Bali. Yes I can wait 3.5 hours for food no issue at a 10.05am departure time. The flight home a 10.45pm departure from Denpasar: keep in mind that there is no food at the new airport (except chips sausages) when you've arrived the required 3 hours prior and then boarded a plane which will arrive Perth at 2am people need to eat. We were in row 10 by the time food arrived there was none left so they offered us a hot meal I don't mind paying but first you need to have food and secondly it needs to be edible. So I paid $35 for 2 meals we couldn't eat and 2 bottles of water.,1
2013,SIN-DAR. Fairly good flight. I had an exit seat for no charge. Had to buy food and rent an iPad which was another $30 but I wasn't bothered as it was a 4hr flight. Staff were good at check in and actually called me to check in early on the tanoy. I had a bike with me too which arrived safe and sound. Seats are pretty good overall good value for money but the food and drink is expensive! I would rather fly with Virgin Australia as they seem to be around the same price and the food and extra luggage is cheaper.,0
2013,"Star Class CNS-TYO and economy TYO-OOL. Flights were on time. In Star class we sat at A1 & A2 the seat had duct tape on the arms to cover up holes. The tray table would not fully fold out and everything kept slipping off it. The service was really good and the food was also very good. The Ipads can be a bit annoying as you have to find somewhere to put them as the front seats have no ""pockets"" to put your items in. Due to putting bags on first in CNS we were the last to receive our bags in TYO which is not like business class on other aircraft's. (You shouldn'thave to wait 45mins for your bags if you are paying a higher price for seats). Economy class on the return was good. The flight was not full so everyone was spaced out. The food was also good quality. Tip if you are pre purchasing a Ipad you will need to provide photo ID a lot of people did not have photo ID and passport is not acceptable (which is strange as you have to pass airport security to board the flight).",0
2013,MEL-HOB and LAU-MEL. Both flights comfortable and the planes clean and tidy. Cabin crew were friendly and polite. First flight left 25mins late only because people could not organise themselves to sit in their seats without rearranging the overhead lockers to suit themselves. Overall pleasant enough.,0
2013,BNK-SYD all good until arrived in Sydney on an outer bay with no air bridge. Apparently an A320 can arrive at the airport on schedule and the ground staff not notice! The captain announced over the pa that the ground staff seemed unaware the aircraft had arrived and he had radioed for stairs so passengers could disembark the aircraft! Travelling on the Qantas group these days is death by a thousand cuts - you never know what service will be cut next - but surely no stairs to disembark the aircraft is taking it a bit far!,1
2013,Sunshine Coast to Sydney. Problem with plane while taxiing. Delayed 3 hours. Later flight cancelled. No voucher or compensation. We have no choice at this airport and flights are always delayed or cancelled. Terrible timetabling for business people traveling to Sydney Melbourne. Totally sick of this non service.,1
2013,I have used Jetstar 3 times in the past two weeks coming and going Sydney to Melbourne and every time they have had delays ranging from 15 minutes to an hour. Tonight my flight Melbourne to Sydney was delayed by an hour and the boarding gate area at Melbourne airport was chaotic hot (no aircon) smelly and didn't have enough seats for passengers so people were sitting on the ground. Reminded me of Bombay airport in the early 80's. More often than not you hear of overbooked passengers from Qantas being transferred to a Jetstar flight but you are never offered a seat on a Qantas flight if you booked through Jetstar and there is a delay. I keep being seduced by the cheaper ticket but really it's just not worth the stress of always running late or having to wait for extended periods in D grade boarding gates. Sorry Jetstar won't be flying with you again.,1
2013,"Hobart to Melbourne JQ714. Supposed to travel 17 October at 2240. Booked our seats about 10 days before travel ($10 fee) and got a printout. Made the mistake of not checking in when we arrived thinking the seat booking was sufficient. So after waiting 2.5 hours to board we discovered that we did need boarding cards. The supervisor then told us it was too late numbers/names had gone to the Captain and there was nothing he could do - catch the next flight in the morning. Where do we stay? Shrug. Sent us to the Jetstar desk to register for the flight and we were told we had to pay $150 late booking fee! Asked the supervisor if he could waive the fee as we had no choice but to book late. ""No can't do that."" Airport closing soon - see you later. No attempt to help or suggest any > accommodation or anything. Found some nice people who helped us find a hotel close by - $189: not much sleep. My question is: why if we've booked and the supervisor goes through the list to make up a manifest can they not make an announcement to check if people who've booked and paid for seats are in the transit lounge? Apparently with online booking this mistake does happen from time to time. Secondly why is it so hard to just call up the Captain and request the addition of 2 more passengers - who already have booked seats? It's called 'Customer Care'. Jetstar clearly don't know what that is.",1
2013,Refused boarding on Jetstar because I was 3.5 minutes late for check in with only hand luggage. Ticket bought through Qantas but it turns out you can't check in to a Jetstar flight using the Qantas website. No redirection to Jetstar website no assistance on the phone. Stuck overnight in Hobart without even a toothbrush. No attempt to try and get me on the plane. Boarding then called 5 minutes after I arrived at check in desk. Charged $100 'late' fee and then travelled the following day in row 31 with no window.,1
2013,"SIN-MEL Star Class (Business). Really disappointing; crew chatted loudly on this overnight flight. I went and spoke to them as they'd woken my son - ignored me and went back to joking and laughing loudly. Breakfast not offered and 90 minutes from MEL was ""too close"" for them to offer even coffee! No eye contact from crew upon boarding or leaving the aircraft. The most personally disconnected flight I've ever taken. The entirely foreign crew may have culturally contributed to this.",1
2013,DRW-SIN. I was sceptical at first but was presently surprised. Check in took some time but I was offered an exit seat without asking and being 6'5 this was very welcome. Staff were friendly plane was generally clean and ok seats weren't great but ok for a 4hr flight. Was a bit annoyed I had to pay for food but it wasn't that expensive and was good quality. Hired an iPad for $12AUD too which had plenty of stuff on to watch. Returning with them in a few weeks and look forward to it.,0
2013,It began in Vietnam in Da Nang. I went online to see the flight status and it was unavailable. We called through and found the flight that was scheduled for a 5.15 pm departure had been delayed. Because the status was unavailable online we were not able to book a late checkout with our hotel. We made our way to Da Nang airport booked a single room so we could have somewhere to wait until 10pm for our re-scheduled check-in for a 12.50am flight. Arrived at the airport at 10pm to find it was not flying until after 2.00 am the plane arrived around 2.45 we arrived in Saigon just before 3.45pm. The flight crew looked exhausted and their safety demonstration was poorly demonstrated. The food was inedible and the captain made no attempt to communicate with the passengers regarding the delay. This was the worst flight experience I have had and the first time with JetStar.,1
2013,Flew with Jetstar from MEL to BNE using a price match fare which was booked quickly by the polite Jetstar agent over the phone. Ground staff at MEL airport were polite and assisted with checking our two bags (under my name) onto the flight. The flight attendants boarding the flight at the gate were extremely rude yelling at passengers to move forward in the long queue. Once onboard the service was better and the crew were quite friendly at times offering to retrieve bags from the overhead compartment. One of my bags didn't arrive in Brisbane - which is curious because it was checked in at the same time as the other bag. I was told that it didn't make it onto the flight and that they would only be able to send it by courier the next day. Overall you get what you pay for but I wouldn't travel with Jetstar on a flight longer than 2.5 hours.,1
2013,Unfortunately I travelled with Jetstar over the long weekend as it was cheaper than other airlines. It was ridiculous - so chaotic unorganised and there were no staff at any of the gates. Firstly my online check-in was not working so I called their help desk and the lady on the phone was not even listening to what I was saying. On my return flight there was no identification of the flight number or time at the gate gate changes over the speaker that were incorrect nor any staff there to help with any queries. Both flights were extremely delayed and the flight crew were not helpful. Bags were moved by the flight crew and they did not inform the passengers. It took over 35 minutes to board the plane. The most annoying part about the whole thing was that the lines to board were crazy - we were told to line up once we were all lined up and waiting in line they decided to change the way in which to board to seat 19-37 first. On both my flights the flight hostesses were rude very unhelpful and kept hitting the back of my seat without apologising. I would never fly Jetstar again it was an awful experience. It was not smooth easy or stress free. My flight outbound had a huge delay - 1.5 hours and I was not informed by sms nor email or a phone call.,1
2013,"On JQ816 from Sydney to Brisbane. Tried to check in at the computers but could not do so because I was mistaking an I for 1. Went to one of their charming ground staff to enquire why I had no luck checking in. If looks could kill she looked at me and said ""can't you see I am dealing with someone else"" and then barked at me to see the service desk. I then got check in ticks and the computer decide to sit my two children away from me. Looking forward to the rest of the trip with JetStar.",1
2013,"Flew on JQ959 from Cairns to Sydney. Many bad things can be told about the bad experience with flying Jetstar (old dirty plane a long delay without any information provided until the scheduled flight time has arrived an attempt to charge for every little thing) but maybe the worst think about Jetstar is the rudeness of the ground crew and the flight attendants. In the case of Jetstar: ""Low cost airline = Low cost crew"". Never again.",1
2013,Sydney to Honolulu return. Seats are old and require repairs. The promoted Kooks wines were not available. Why promote wine if unavailable? Why does Jetstar charge people for every individual alcoholic drink? Cost of flight plus cost of meals wines etc. resulted into overall cost less competitive. Will look for another airline next time.,1
2013,"Gold Coast to Perth Seat 9A booked a month ahead. Cheap airfares are cheap airfares so expectations shouldn't be very high. Taken off on-time arrived a whopping 40 min early (usually 5hr 20min flight) due to tail-wind crossing Australia. Staff were friendly good service. Living in the world's most expensive country paying $3.50 for an in-flight can of Coke was to be expected and OK considering the low price of the airfare. Did get complimentary glasses of water with ice on a couple of occasions. General observations clean aircraft but reclining button on my seat did not work making the lack of legroom (I'm 6ft 2"") slightly more challenging to handle.",0
2013,Hubby and I travel to Bali regularly on business and as neither of us are teenagers (and hubby is 6ft 3) we prefer to travel business class. In our experience Jetstar is not as good as it used to be. Attitudes of airline staff are pretty dodgy with only one air steward on our recent flight seeming at all interested in passengers. It is a budget airline but the cleanliness of the cabin should not be compromised. Chewing gum was stuck to the seat in front of me windows were covered in finger prints which indicated a child had sat in the seat on the previous flight and the toilets at the front of the plane were not clean to begin with so were quite revolting by the end of the 6hr flight. To top it off the young couple in the seats directly in front of us reclined their seats as far back as possible so neither my hubby nor I could move his knees were literally squished into the back of the seat. When we asked the air steward to request they pop their seats forward slightly so we could at least move our legs the response was very cool but they eventually acquiesced. When paying so much extra for a little bit of comfort some consideration for the customer is expected. Lift your game Jetstar not good enough!,1
2013,Jetstar Japan: I flew Sapporo - Narita return in May 2013. Tickets were 3960 yen each way and I paid an extra 800 yen per flight for an exit row seat. Both flights were on time and in new A320's with a nice interior. For a short flight with the exit row seats I was more than comfortable. At less than $100 USD for a round trip to Tokyo I am very happy that low cost airlines are now flying in Japan and I will most definitely fly them again.,0
2013,Launceston to Brisbane return. Check In Staff were friendly both ends and flights on time aircraft clean and tidy. Return A320 near new and spotless. Cabin Crew were friendly and walked up and down tending to passengers the entire flight. We had emergency exit seats on the trip over which made the flight very pleasant and row 4 on the return The seats on the newer aircraft were much firmer and anything over 2 hours becomes hard work but all in all these were cheap tickets and we got exactly what we paid for and this made the trip excellent value. The convenience of this direct flight is always worth the chance of flying with this budget Airline.,0
2013,BNE-TSV in A320 September 2013. Flight up on JQ906 was good - delay caused by passengers made up in air service efficient seat pitch and width adequate for a quick flight. 5 hours before departure we received a text message and email informing that the return flight had been cancelled - called Jetstar customer service and were put on to a slightly later QF and were given a $200 voucher for future Jetstar travel. Very happy with Jetstar customer service - particularly as the tickets were super cheap sale fares on a low cost carrier.,0
2013,Flew JQ29 to Bangkok in May from Melbourne. Flight left on time staff were polite and cheerful. Cabin crew were entertaining and prompt. Can't fault the service at all. Smooth flight arrived Bangkok on time. Good trip. Return trip was equally good.,0
2013,We flew international from Sydney to Nadi (Fiji). I was extremely impressed with Jetstar. Flight left on time was smooth and cabin crew were well presented and courteous. They were very accommodating to my 23 month old who cried most of the light. We bought some food from menu all reasonably priced and the tablets were better than Virgin ie better range of children's movies/shows. The flight was not full so I was able to have 3 seats to myself. Toilets were clean and functional. I would defiantly fly Jetstar again.,0
2013,Travelling with Jetstar return to Singapore from Australia on a Airbus A320. No pillow no leg room find it very difficult to get in and out of the seat. No complementary drink. Airfare over priced for what you get nothing. After travelling with other cheap airlines with the same aircraft more leg room better service free drink pillow and cheaper fares.,1
2013,Having previously experienced delays and cancellations with Jetstar I was curious to see how this flight would be. Overall it was very good. I paid $39 for Sydney to Melbourne (Avalon) and it was money well spent considering the alternative flights at the same time with other airlines to Melbourne (Tullamarine) were much more expensive. The flight was a good example of what a LCC should be. On time departure and arrival friendly crew a clean A320 and surprisingly comfortable seats. I am 180cm and my knees were not touching the seat in front perhaps due to the clever re-positioning of the magazine pocket to the top of the seat-back above the meal tray. I would fly Jetstar again if the price is right.,0
2013,Recently flew Brisbane to Newcastle NSW return. This is the second time I have flown Jetstar (only because I had to) no problems at all. Slow check in outbound but quick check in on return and a short and comfortable flight.,0
2013,Flew Perth to Denpasar on 25th June 2013 on JQ116. My second and last flight with Jetstar. Supposed to depart at 09.30 hrs I awoke at 05.30 hrs to find an SMS stating the flight was delayed 1 hr. Got to the airport and checked in and went through security by 08.00 hrs and waited until 09.30 only to be told flight was again delayed. Come midday again told flight would be delayed to 13.30 hrs. Given a $10 voucher for lunch which doesn't even buy a snack at airport prices. Staff finally opened the gate at 12.50 hrs with a mad scramble to board. Once on board we waited another 45 mins for a 2nd engineer to be found to sign off on the repair. Finally departed at 13.30 hrs and arrived at 17.45 in Denpasar. We paid for a meal on board and never received it - we paid for priority boarding and never got it. Drip-feeding flight delay information is typical of a poor airline operation. I will never fly with them again under any circumstances.,1
2013,Return trip from Sydney to Nadi. The plane was on time on the outgoing trip. The seats were so uncomfortable I found it hard to find a comfortable position the chairs are too upright. The homebound trip the check-in gate opened up half an hour late. The plane was delayed for 2.5 hours. The entertainment was useless you had to pay for iPads and there weren't even enough on board. There wasn't enough food onboard on the homebound trip. You have to pay for everything. The only good thing is that staff were quite friendly.,1
2013,PER-MEL. The main reason being we were given $200 in vouchers for cancelled flight from earlier this year from Denpasar to Perth. Trying to book the tickets online the vouchers wouldn't work. Checked with online Jetstar staff who assured me vouchers were valid. After 8 more attempts gave up and booked on phone. In the end the overall cost went up by approx $185 thus cancelling out vouchers. Probably would not have travelled with them as they worked out to be not much cheaper than other airlines after the 'voucher' debacle. What can I say the staff do the best they can but all in all very badly run. The food is average with very small selection the seats are uncomfortable and not particularly clean. Be careful if you get 'vouchers' It lured us into flying with Jetstar when we probably wouldn't have otherwise.,1
2013,Flew MEL - Darwin on JQ61 which then continues on to Singapore. Signs were bad to start with when the check in area at Tullamarine was shambolic with enormous queues and no bag drop operating. Eventually made it to the downstairs departure lounge and queued at the allocated gate only to find at the last minute that the gate had changed with no announcement which left about 50 passengers scrambling through the terminal to catch the flight. With the doors shut plane then sat at the departure gate for 25 minutes with no advice or announcements about the reason for the delay and how it would effect our arrival time. When the flight finally departed about a third of the in flight snack menu was unavailable and the attendants were unable to accept foreign currency despite us receiving an unsolicited email from Jetstar 2 days earlier explaining that foreign currencies were accepted on this flight. With a budget airline like Jetstar the customer needs to have budget expectations but its no excuse for the airline not misinform passengers and stuff them around. Jetstar is definitely slipping.,1
2013,Booked on JQ60 SIN to Darwin 26 Jun for timings that didn't involve a red eye flight. However flight departure delayed from 7.35pm to 10pm and became a red eye flight. My previous trip on JQ64 was delayed almost 2 hours and the one before on JQ60 was cancelled and all passengers bumped to the red eye flight. The flights to Singapore from Darwin have a very bad on time performance and this can be confirmed through the flight status tab on both the Jetstar and Qantas sites. I do not recommend this airline.,1
2013,I flew from Sydney to Hawaii recently and was very impressed especially since my other flights in the following days on Delta and Alaska Airlines were terrible! The staff were very polite and extremely understanding when I told them I had a nut allergy the cabin was clean and the seating was comfortable. The only complaint I could have was the lack of in-flight entertainment you have to pay to get an iPad but other than that it was a wonderful flight. I would definitely recommend Jetstar if you're flying both nationally and internationally.,0
2013,You do get what you pay for but in saying that the plane was spotless staff were nice easy trip and on time. Only downside was one of our direct flights was rescheduled so we had to stop over in Melbourne. Yes annoying but these things happen. Would I fly with them again. Yes definitely but only for a cheap fair. Wouldn't pay full price as the extras add up as I am a diver and have heavy luggage so wouldn't be worth it.,0
2013,Flew Melbourne to Adelaide with a toddler and baby. Unfortunately flew Jetstar as it fitted in best with nap times. Staff didn't even try to help as I struggled up the rear stairs with baby in sling toddler and bag. Consistently the worst customer service of all of the Australian airlines. Reiterated why I will only ever fly Jetstar if the timing and route is by far the best option.,1
2013,I regularly fly Jetstar from Newcastle to Brisbane. Not my favourite airline - much prefer Qantas - but from Newcastle usually Jetstar offers the schedule that fits my plans. Its a budget airline so you get what you pay for and it is short flight so the cramped conditions are tolerable. Would be nice if the food and beverages included a couple of healthier options. In summary - if you have to fly Jetstar it is tolerable but if given the option pay a little more and fly with Qantas.,0
2013,The seat was cramped but apart from that the leather seat was reasonably comfy. I flew from Darwin to Melbourne and the staff were pretty. You get what you paid for. The flights were cheap so there was no entertainment food or drinks provided.,1
2013,SYD to HKT return Business Class. Both flights on time. Service level very good. ood has improved and was very tasty. Very good value product.,0
2013,June 8th flight 3k132. Flight due to leave 00.05 told there would be a 20 minute delay it ended up being 3 hours then told the flight was cancelled. Why take so long to make a decision It was rescheduled for 14.30 that afternoon I missed my pick up driver when we arrived in Singapore had to wait another hour.,1
2013,I never thought I would write a good review about Jetstar. But here goes. Flew Melbourne Hawaii return in Business class. Impressed with the produce for the price that you pay. Both flights bang on time. Staff were super friendly on the way over and friendly on the way back. Food out of MEL was great. Very impressed. 9 out of 10. Not so out of Hawaii. 6 out 10. We had one of the new A330 with the in seat video which was great going to Hawaii. Plane was in great condition. Coming home we had one of the older ones and boy do you notice. Though the seats were very comfortable but juggling the video and a meal was too hard. Its one or the other. So overall happy with the international service of Jetstar. Now if that could filter down to its domestic product.,0
2013,"MEL-BKK 30 May 2013 business class and was delighted with the change of service level since my past experience with the airline approximately one year ago. Check in was efficient with a dedicated business line. Use of the QF lounge was available as was use of the immigration express lane. Flight was 1 hour late departing as the aircraft required ""routine maintenance"" and both the cabin crew and captain apologised for the delay. In-flight service was good and included a complimentary drinks and meal service. Cabin crew were very efficient and attentive. Of the meal choice offered selected a form of lamb stew which might have been appropriate for a Melbourne winter but far too heavy as an appropriate meal. In-flight entertainment was through the use of an iPad. A330 aircraft was clean although the seat pitch could have been better. Overall good service and value for money.",0
2013,Bangkok - Melbourne Return - Business Class - May 2013. Could not fault either flight - brilliant value for money comfortable roomy seats great friendly staff and all in all an enjoyable and memorable experience for our annual holiday. Definitely great value.,0
2013,Sydney - Melbourne/Avalon and return. Used Qantas lounge in SYD a big plus. Offered exit row seats at baggage drop/check-in both ways so the otherwise tight seat pitch wasn't an issue. Both flights pretty much on time and Avalon is a breeze to use compared to MEL. Orderly efficient boarding procedure and baggage delivery. Staff all polite and competent.,0
2013,Excellent cabin crew both flights to Thailand. Very quiet and comfortable trip. Highly recommend and would not hesitate to travel Jetstar again in the future.,0
2013,Very cheap flight BNK-SYD (9am) from a small airport so straight forward boarding process with mobile sms boarding pass via online check-in and no check in baggage. Smooth but impersonal as one would expect for a true budget/shuttle style flight. Seats comfortable new design with seat pocket elevated to the top of the seat improves legroom and perception of space. An area of improvement for this and other Jetstar flights would be limiting the ridiculous amount of carry-on they encourage people to bring on board. Compounded by the lack of assistance stowing it. A little supervision here would go a long way.,0
2013,JQ188 7 May 2013 14.55 Seat 1F Christchurch to Gold Coast. Good flight on time good service and nice cabin crew. It's only a 3 hour so a cup of tea and a book or magazine is all that's needed.,0
2013,Flight to Sydney 2nd May 4 hrs late leaving. Not advised at check in and travelers advised in the departure lounge 30 mins before flight departed. Offer of an $8 refreshment voucher. Cheapest sandwich in the airport costs more! Advised by staff to use it at the donut stand. No empathy from ground staff made it worse the uncaring person at the desk was a manager. The next scheduled to Sydney left on time leaving customers whose earlier flight was cancelled still waiting. A little bit of empathy goes a long way and it was certainly not forthcoming from Jetstar staff. Flew back Qantas today what a pleasure. Will never fly Jetstar again.,1
2013,We booked months ago a flight to Bali which Jetstar cancelled. No refund has been received after many weeks and I have been told it may even take 12 weeks to see the refund. I managed to get a more expensive flight & longer flight on Garuda. Well done Jetstar for insisting on payment immediately upon booking and then not returning it when you cancelled our flight. Poor business practise and I recommend to everyone to be very mindful Jetstar will cost you money when they cancel their flights!,1
2013,Adelaide to Cairns return in April. We paid extra for front row seats D E and F behind the bulkhead which separates galley from cabin. There was not much information on the net about Row 1 seats and we were not sure if the legroom would be the same as in the exit row seats further back as (from memory) Row 1 pre-selected seats are a little cheaper. Our seats were great! Plenty of legroom and didn't have the claustrophobic feeling that can be experienced in an economy cabin. Row 1 seats A B and C have even more leg room with no bulkhead in front. Take your own food and hire an I-Pad and with a bit of a stretch of the imagination is a bit like flying a budget business class! Crew friendly. Would have liked more talk from the cockpit and maybe a second trolley run on the 3 hour flight.,0
2013,Took weekday flights from MEL-LST return. Both flights were on time for departure and arrival. All boarding and cabin staff were efficient friendly and cheerful. As you expect on a budget airline the seating is cramped but its no real problem on such a short flight. Overall no issues with the flight or service. The biggest problem is the shambolic departure area in the downstairs Qantas/Jetstar terminal in Melbourne. An absolute bunfight and a totally inadequate space to hold the number of people departing and arriving.,0
2013,Two flight delays from Melbourne airport in two days of travel is pretty poor service. Very disappointed in the staff at service desks who were uninterested in passenger concerns. Will never flight Jetstar again better off spending a little extra for a more reliable service.,1
2013,HON-MEL. Was satisfied with Jetstar no they are not Qantas but the 11 hour flight went fast. We were under a Qantas codeshare so we were supplied with food and drink. After take off we got a warm breakfast and then sometime later in the flight we got a hot lunch as well both meals were fine. I pre ordered a digi player for my friend and I to share and they ended up giving us one each and also the amenities pack. I would fly Jetstar again as you just cant beat there prices.,0
2013,Singapore to Melbourne mid April. Check in immigration and security were quick and efficient. Friendly welcome aboard from the flight crew with the offer of drinks prior to push back. Take off was on time hot towels were offered and the food was quite acceptable with beverages offered. Entertainment was on ipads and more than adequate for a 7-1/2 hour flight. The seat was adequate with sufficient leg room but was by no means what one would expect from a quality airline. Nevertheless I managed a few hours sleep. All up a surprisingly pleasant flight with an early arrival into Melbourne and very good value for the price paid.,0
2013,I was surprised to find that on a flight from Perth to Brisbane there was no food provided. We then had to wait in an enormous queue for more than an hour so no time to get breakfast at the airport.,1
2013,Flew PEK-SIN-DPS with Jetstar Asia and Valuair. Check-in at PEK was terrible with messy lines and no organization I had not picked seats and was separate from my friends. On the PEK-SIN flight crew allowed us to change as it was an empty flight and we got the extra legroom seats which were great the SIN-DPS was full and other seats had terrible legroom although a bun and water was served which is nice all flights were on time.,0
2013,Melbourne to Perth. Airbus A320 which was very clean and much nicer than the Qantas B767 I flew to Melbourne on. Ground crew in Melbourne and Perth pleasant and helpful. However service onboard was quite poor and staff seemed disinterested. But it's a budget airline so it's to be expected. Upon arrival At Perth no gates at the terminal were available so our aircraft parked in the middle of the tarmac and we were bussed to the terminal when we landed the buses were busy and we had to wait 40 minutes in Perth for a bus from the plane to the terminal. Melbourne's Jetstar gates are a luxury compared to Perth. Overall a good experience for the price I paid for the flight.,0
2013,I have never flown this airline without a delay and yesterday a cancellation of my flight. Extremely poor customer service from counter staff and the offer of a bus added salt to the wound. Their service is inferior their reliability non-existent.,1
2013,Hobart - Melbourne on an A320. There was a long queue for the baggage drop - there seems little advantage in using the machine to tag your own bag. Once on board any size or weight of take-on baggage seems acceptable so that we were told to keep our reasonable sized bags around our feet so that other people who had got large bulging bags on board could stow theirs in the overhead lockers. The seat seemed to have a slightly greater pitch than on the Jetstar A321. The flight operated 20 minutes late but was generally a pleasant experience.,0
2013,OOL-MEL. Was met at the airport by the grumpiest check-in staff member. Aircraft clean and seated in a row of 3 with 2 spare seats. Crew were very good but just going through the motions. Flight departed on time and landed about 5 mins early. Uneventful flight and would use them again but prefer Virgin.,0
2013,My wife and I flew from Tokyo to Osaka. Flight itself was on time the inflight service was acceptable (we didn't pay for food which doesn't come free anyway) and the seats while a bit tight were OK for a flight of less than an hour. The on-the-ground service however left a lot to be desired. We missed both our inbound and outbound flights and both times we called ahead to explain our situation. The first time we were able to change our flight to an early one the next day! When we had to change our flight on the return flight the woman on duty refused to even look at us informing us tersely that there was nothing to be done but cancel or pay for another flight. We took ANA's Star Flight and had a much better experience with excellent service. Still a cheap airline but they seemed to understand their relationship with the customer.,1
2013,Melbourne to Hobart and return both legs on an A321. The dungeon-like departure area in Melbourne is a poor start to the journey. The plane to Hobart departed and arrived 15 mins late. On board service in both directions was friendly and efficient but the seat pitch was tight. I paid a very cheap fare and the flights represented very good value.,0
2013,"Launceston - Sydney 22/3/13. Arrived at airport 7pm for 8.15 departure only to read departure board - flight delayed until 9.35. No texts sent to advise prior. At 9pm the board indicated ""Flight Cancelled"" - no announcement until 5 mins later! Mad scramble to line up for vouchers. Had to organise own taxis. Given $35 voucher for food/drink and $15 for b/f. Next morning back to airport for 10 am departure. By 9.50 still not boarding - no announcements. Finally on board 10.05 - no apologies - then sat on tarmac until 10.40. Departed and finally Captain announced at 11am ""sorry for delay"". Staff advised that ""due to no catering in Launceston there is no fresh food available nor ice for drinks"". Only good thing was they have given us a $100 voucher off next flight (dare I chance it again).",1
2013,Auckland-Singapore return: I was a little apprehensive about flying with Jetstar due to poor reputation in NZ. I needn't have worried. Smooth and hassle-free check-in (both ways) very friendly check-in staff (both ways) positive and hard-working cabin crew (both ways) food and IPad perfectly adequate both flights pretty much on schedule seat absolutely fine for the length of journey (10 hours). A good return trip all round. For the ticket price paid this product represented exceptionally good value.,0
2013,MEL-HNL JQ 1 in business class. Only negative was the old domestic business style seat. It gets a bit uncomfortable during a long flight. Cabin crew did a good job food was ok and there was plenty of it. IFE on iPad a bit limited. Left on time and arrived early. Overall a very good flight.,0
2013,Sunday 13th March I travelled from Hobart to Sydney. Staff were friendly and flight was smooth. However I was seated in row 30 and the leg room (pitch) was about 22cm from the edge of my seat to the magazine pocket. We had to put our carry-on luggage under he seat because there was no room in the overhead storage area. I stress that the flight attendants were excellent.,1
2013,We flew Sydney to Hobart. The good news: the flight was on time. The bad news: the seats were just as uncomfortable as those on sister airline Qantas.,1
2013,I've just had another bad experience with this airline and I will never travel Jetstar again. This trip the flight I was departing on has been cancelled and I was offered a flight approximately 4 hours earlier. Since this was not possible due to other commitments and anything offered resulted in me missing the event I was travelling for I asked for a refund. The staff member informed me this was only available for the departure and they could not refund the return sector. A return flight isn't much good when you cant get there! Terrible customer service and I won't be caught again!,1
2013,22 Feb 13 BKK-SIN. Flight delayed 2 hours. Letter handed out stating for operational reasons. Nothing else offered. We were given emergency exit seats however. Flight full but uneventful. No explanation of regret offered for late arrival. Cabin Crew worked well.,0
2013,It's a quick trip between these 2 cities but passengers spend longer at the airports than on the plane. Bag drop at Melbourne was a slow process. About 50 people in line and only 4 of the 12 desks operating. When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient. Despite the aircraft being on the ground for a good 35 minutes most of the windows were grubby. The flight was fine and I had about 2cm between my knees and the seat in front. Thankfully they didn't recline the seat. A 15 minute delay in Sydney waiting for a clear air-bridge and a 20 minute wait to collect our bags capped off an uneventful flight.,0
2013,My wife and I flew Jetstar from Osaka to Denpasar via Singapore. Apart from a slight delay out of Osaka the remaining flights were smooth and most comfortable. We did reserve in advance the seats in front of the emergency exit for the Osaka/Singapore flight which provided more than enough leg-room. Standard seat selection was chosen for the Singapore/Denpasar flight. Will fly again with Jetstar definitely.,0
2013,MEL-DPS Business class A330-200. Overall excellent flight - great value for money I purchased ticket on sale. Cabin crew friendly and helpful - IPads and meals served very quickly. You get what you pay for with the seat - it's no flat bed but nevertheless I found it very comfortable and even managed to get some sleep. I would fly Jetstar again.,0
2013,Flight JQ458 SYD to Ballina. Sat in seat 5C. The plane took off a few minutes late but landed on time. The flight crew were professional and friendly. Leather seats were very comfortable. Quality of food for purchase onboard not bad.,0
2013,Sydney to the Sunshine Coast and back last week. Couldn't fault anything on either trip. Flights left on time cabin crew friendly and professional aircraft clean. Although won't be back in Australia for some time would recommend them.,0
2013,ADL-MEL JQ773 8/2/2013 Airbus A320 aircraft. What a pleasure to have been greeted by a friendly Flight Attendant when our boarding passes were being checked inside Adelaide Airport Terminal. Upon boarding the rear of the aircraft again a pleasant welcome from the Flight Attendant. Welcomed onboard with a smile. Aircraft was clean and the seats comfortable. I did not purchase anything on this short flight but service from the crew was efficient. There were announcements from the pilot during the flight and also upon landing in Melbourne. This is the third time I have flown with Jetstar and I have always found the crew to be professional. This is a budget airline and I did not pay for all the extras but cannot complain.,0
2013,Awful right from the get go. Very poor legroom little recline on seats. No entertainment. Very bad service from inflight staff. This is easily the worst airline I've been on. You get what you pay for. Budget price = budget everything.,1
2013,JQ1 Sydney to Melbourne a few weeks ago. The standard of service and customer communication I received from this airline was horrible! The old A330-200 aircraft was dated and the leg room was bad even for economy. Ground staff treated us more like cattle than passengers if it wasn't for my ability to run with the crowd I would have been trampled whilst boarding as there was no line or structure to this process. Once the cabin crew completed their food and beverage service you never saw them again until disembarking. Once we landed it took them about 40 minutes before we received our luggage. All over very disappointing - you get what you pay for!,1
2013,SIN-MEL. Very disappointed by the performance of the cabin crew. For a flight of only 6.5 hours the crew took 2 hours 45 mins to serve drinks/dinner and 1.5 hours to serve breakfast. Bear in mind that this is a low cost airline and meals etc are only provided to those who are prepared to pay at the time of serving. I took a good look at the number of passengers who did purchase meals and there were not many therefore the serving times should have been a lot faster than they were. In between serving the crew made no attempt to contain their noise coming from the galley. Probably the most disruptive flight I have been on and for a change it was not the passengers who were the cause. Perhaps a review of the serving processes is required to help speed this up. No respect to passengers on this night flight.,1
2013,What a terrible experience. Once you have booked your tickets they make it nearly impossible to change your details. Tried to ring them up from Bali to add on luggage and after a 2 hour wait got someone who couldn't speak a word of English. Got to the airport and explained what had happened and was told straight that they didn't care and to fly another airline if I didn't like it. They then charged me $160 for 6kg of luggage. It didn't get any better once on board. The leg room was non existent and my knees where against the back of the seat in front for the 3.5 hour flight. Had to pay for any food and drinks with your credit card and again rude staff. Will never fly with Jetstar ever again.,1
2013,SYD - MEL on JQ1. Boarding delayed and rushed causing departure from the International Terminal to be 40 mins late. Although it was a sale fare the service was poor and communication with passengers was limited. Seats were uncomfortable and narrow and the selection of food and drinks was minimal. The landing was terrible and even resulted in some applause from the passengers! I'll stick to Virgin or Qantas from now on - and I wouldn't even consider JQ International after this experience.,1
2013,My comments relate to the Jetstar Airport lounge (gates 25-30) at Melbourne Tullamarine airport. My flight is JQ 61 to Darwin on 29/1/13. I've never had a problem with travelling on any of JQ flights but this waiting area is disgusting. Many seats are in poor repair and actually have a very unsavoury odour and the floors are littered with rubbish. I appreciate that this may be a period between cleaning team arrival but it's very tacky and would give a poor impression to all travellers.,0
2013,BNE-PER and return. Outward leg OK apart from the fact that this is a long flight and the seats are very uncomfortable and narrow forget about sleeping. Poor selection of food and drinks onboard. Return leg terrible: direct flight to Brisbane was split by Jetstar into a PER-MEL and MEL-BNE with 2 hour wait in MEL! Experienced rude service! Will not fly with them again.,1
2013,From checking in to our arrival in Wellington we could not find fault with this airline or its staff. We had a very rough landing in the gales at Wellington and had to go round for a 2nd try. We could not fault the staff during the turbulence. Our bags were out for collection by the time we got to the arrivals area we will be flying Jetstar again in the future.,0
2013,MEL-SIN return. We chose not to pay extra for mileage credits. We sought legroom and we got it. The seat width was suitable. We needed a wheelchair and pusher at all travel terminal areas as they had slopes difficult joining lips & pushing distances beyond what I am capable of doing. Jetstar assisted with a wheelchair on the outward leg. Only after much discussion did we get 'pusher' assistance on arrival in Singapore. When this came it was an excellent 'local service' - a gratuity was not begrudged. For frequent travellers being a continuing Qantas Club member as I am was wise. In Singapore they arranged the 'pusher' service to our return gate. Sadly at both check-ins knowledge by Jetstar staff about Business Class Max rights plus those of Qantas Club Members was either nil or misinformed. It was a bad start later righted by Qantas Club Staff at both lounges. The in light food choices were acceptable. No problems with the complimentary liquor nor level of service table decor or travel amenities supplied. Seat back lowering by the person in front was a concern on both flights as we had to disturb those persons when we wished to move about. Our outward seats were in Row 6  the last in Business Class with restricted but acceptable lowering for a day flight not suitable if overnight. The Jetstar web-site would not let me pre-select a seat if you had asked for wheelchair assistance as we had - it was one or the other and this is unsatisfactory. On return I opted to select Row 4 to fully recline. In this position the seat is not a fully reclining sleeper- footrest space is insufficient. With a 2-3-2 configuration in this cabin I would not choose the middle seat of a fully occupied 3. We were fortunate both ways in not having a full cabin thus no problem with overhead storage but a number of the compartments were taken up with staff bags and service items-not good. Ours were Jetstar stop-over flights in Singapore as part of flying to/from China thus and correctly there were helpful Chinese & English speaking flight attendants however the level of English could have been better. In reading some of the adverse comments about Jetstar Business the benefits provided compared to cost is being ignored. It is a precious approach to compare Jetstar to a 'full service' airline. I would fly Jetstar Business/Star Class again.,0
2013,HNL-MEL. Delayed 49 hours kept on runway for 3.5 hrs with air-conditioning on and off for up to 30min at a time little information from the cockpit. Eventually we were returned to the terminal to be told flight was cancelled spent next two nights awaiting more information given a disgraceful $250 Jetstar voucher as compensation - horrible experience.,1
2013,Honolulu to Sydney - a 10+ hour flight in Business Class. Booked using AA Miles and thought we'd booked Qantas. 1 week before our trip we discovered it was on JetStar. This was our honeymoon and my husband is 6 ft 3 and a big man. We braced ourselves for a miserable flight. However the flight was a pleasure. Food was delicious. True legroom is tight and when the seat in front of you is reclined you cannot get out without disturbing your neighbors. A lovely amenity kit provided. The earphones were extremely comfortable and the pre-loaded Ipad has a nice choice of entertainment. Flight attendants were warm professional and accommodating. As for rating the value for money we used our AA miles so I can only say that it was a most pleasant flight in Business Class with excellent food excellent service nice entertainment options pillows blankets and comfortable leather seats. Other than the seats being a little tight for legroom our flight was a pleasure.,0
2013,Flew SIN-KUL return recently. Booking and check-in process was hassle-free and smooth. However I felt that it could be rather expensive since credit card's convenience fee are charged. Leather seats are comfortable.,0
2013,Booked the tickets from Sydney to Melbourne (return) and Sydney to Gold Coast (return) via online travel agent. The main gripe was the check-in process although the system will send you an automatic SMS to check in online but still there's no difference without checked-in online that we still have to queue with the other passengers. Nevertheless the ground staff were really helpful and patient also the cabin crew were very friendly!,1
2013,SYD-ADL. Quite pricey for the tickets as there are other hidden fees such as online booking fees and credit card fees which aren't included in the advertised price. Boarded the old and worn A320 about 45 minutes late and waited another 30 minutes before we began to taxi for take-off. No in-flight entertainment unless you want to pay money to rent an iPad. No leg room and zero recline. Arrived quite late and only got an apology from the flight stewardess which was nice. Overall not too bad for the price you paid but trust me there are better flights out there for just a few extra bucks.,1
2012,Jetstar Business Melbourne to Beijing. Jetstar is a LCC and the price of their business class tickets is very reasonable. In addition you do not pay a hefty rate for booking a one way ticket as you do with a full service airline. The service was cheerful and competent. The food fine and plenty of drinks on request. I had a middle seat in middle aisle so really the worst seat in business class however it was comfortable and I was able to sleep. The I pad entertainment is limited but then most people load their own I pad before travelling. The young staff were great and the price of the ticket very competitive. If you plan carefully you can often pick up very reasonably priced tickets.,0
2012,Darwin-Melbourne. Turned up for a 7.30 am flight found out it had been cancelled - not notified then told the wrong time for flight. Turned up to discover real time was the next day and then landed an hour late no one would tell me what was going on - lost a day of my holiday.,1
2012,Absolute nightmare is the only way I can describe the situation we found ourselves in upon arriving in Melbourne from Singapore. Our flight to Brisbane was cancelled. Despite warnings I booked return airfares to Singapore. The flights weren't that cheap once you paid for all the add-ons. No food is provided unless you pay for it. In fact you're best to pre-book because the food runs out. Back to Melbourne. Jetstar offered us an alternative flight on Qantas. We wanted to go home early to save us hanging around the airport for hours. We were offered one flight which left later than the one they cancelled. No effort to be conciliatory. Given the fault was theirs they should have made at least some effort to be more helpful. We couldn't check in our luggage because the paperwork wasn't done. We were forced to stay at the airport for 9 hours - only 1 without our bags. Put this one down to experience but can guarantee I'll never fly Jetstar international again.,1
2012,Was travelling (SYD-AVV 18/12/12 18.40) with my child so wanted to be one of the first to board so we could settle so we lined up early. This seemed to annoy the flight attendant and just as they were about to announce the boarding she asked me to check the bag size using the gauge they have for that purpose. I picked up the larger of our 2 bags that were on the floor side-by-side and halfway there she said not that one the other one. It was a standard luggage bag that she would have known was in regulation size and visually you could see it was the smaller of the two. As soon as I left the now-formed queue she turned her back and did not even look at what I was doing. It's obviously a game they play.,0
2012,My 75 yo father flew Jetstar domestic Adelaide to Melbourne. I arranged this flight for him online as he is blind. At the Jetstar check-in Adelaide he was charged $70 for having a near empty cabin bag that was only 4cm over length. Technically a breach of cabin baggage dimensions but he was not aware of this. Took all his spare cash to pay it so he had no cash to pay for a taxi at Melbourne airport. He is unable to use an ATM. He explained all this no consideration given no assistance offered. The attitude was take it or leave it. Will never fly them again.,1
2012,Melbourne-Cairns return. Flight to Cairns departed reasonably late. Both flights just average. Service okay and reasonably friendly but nothing great. Planes clean. If you get a cheap airfare then I would recommend flying with them but there are other domestic airlines who are better service wise.,0
2012,JQ3 SYD-HNL on 4th December one way first time international with Jetstar. Had a delay due to a computer issue so for safety reasons we left at 20.30 instead of 18.00. During the delay the flight attendants were not any good as they had put them self in the galley and only came down with a small drink of water which wasn't that nice. The captain was much helpful with information during the delay. After take-off in flight entertainment started but not for long. Didn't have any food or drink as I was sick during the flight except water during the delay. Would recommend it if your looking for the cheapest way possible but at the same time wouldn't recommend it. I would personally keep to domestic with Jetstar.,1
2012,Frustrating trip to Launceston flying Jetstar. Remember to book any checked in luggage more than 24 hours before your flight and if you get an error message that says you are not eligible to book call their service centre to resolve (which we should have done) as baggage charges increase significantly if you buy baggage allowance at the airport. We also arrived to the airport with ample time to spare but waited 30 mins in a service queue to sort baggage which caused us then to be late for flight. Partly expected for a low cost airline I suppose.,1
2012,We travelled from Melbourne to Singapore yesterday. Purchased flights approx 5 months ago on a special. We had seats 1 J and K which are bulk head seats. We have travelled business class with Emirates and were never under the assumption that we were going to get the same level with Jetstar. Some fellow passengers were disappointed with the service but they had much higher expectations. We would defiantly fly Star Class again and I think for the extra it represents good value especially if you can purchase during a sale.,0
2012,SYD-HNL-SYD. Seated at the back of the plane. Plane was full but there was enough space. Check in was efficient and flights on time both ways. IFE was the only let down. Very limited range of movies and even though we flew over in Oct and back in Nov we had Nov choices both ways so 20 hrs with only 2 movies I wanted to see out of the limited selection. We didn't buy food but took our own on the plane and this was no problem. Checking in baggage is not inexpensive but if you do it at time of booking it is not too bad. If you follow the rules about booking/ flying with a LCC they are definitely worth looking into.,0
2012,Took advantage of specials to Japan to either Osaka or Narita flying from Sydney stopping at Gold Coast. Very surprised with the service I received flying from the Gold Coast to Narita on A330. Staff are friendly helpful and less rude than their domestic counter parts. Flight to Narita was 9.5 hrs from Gold Coast and add around 1.5 hrs from Sydney to Gold Coast but still being a very large plane and only around 50 or so people on board you can take advantage of the 4 seaters. I have learnt that you don't have to book seats on these flights and pay an extra $25 for it better to use that money to add check baggage to your flight and checked baggage isn't really cheap at $45 for 15kg. The food was ok best to bring your own snacks and water.,0
2012,My Jetstar experience began with the website not taking my booking properly and checked baggage wasn't booked. For this they charged me an additional $70 to check my 7kg bag on a flight that didn't cost much more for myself. Flight was late took an extremely long time getting on board due to lack of organisation. Probably the most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced. The hostess was snarly. I ordered an iPad for the flight and the selection was terrible.,1
2012,We flew Business Max class from Melbourne to Singapore and although Jetstar promises that they offer all of the normal business class service they neglect to mention that the seats are only marginally larger than economy and hardly recline at all! There is so little room between the rows that when the passenger in front has his seat reclined it is almost impossible to leave your seat! On a short daytime flight perhaps but on an overnight flight sleep is impossible. The food was however quite good and the alcohol service OK but nothing makes up for uncomfortable seating or the lack of pillows (unbelievable even though they provide a blow-up neck support). They also don't offer the normal express service through immigration etc and no priority baggage handling which is quite annoying. So in summary - a definite improvement on economy seating but by no means the normal business class that they promise but then again you get what you pay for!,1
2012,SYD-HBA-SYD in economy row 1 bulkhead. I'm a QFF silver and was again impressed by just how good JQ can be for LCC. Efficiently boarded & pushed back right on time (each sector). Row 1 bulkhead/partition seats were a good choice for a day flight. No IFE or free snack service but not needed. Clean aircraft. However it does take more effort to monitor a JQ booking for schedule changes and cancellations.,0
2012,Australia to Phuket return in Business Class. I have never been so disappointed. I was in seat 4k - when the seat belt sign went off the passenger in front reclined and the space was less than economy. By the time I was able to ask a flight attendant to ask the person in front to move the seat forward a bit they refused as they said he was asleep! The seat pan width was 28 cms to the tray table it was almost impossible to eat and equally impossible to get out. Jetstar Business Class is the worst leg room I have experienced and to have that in a Business Class is unforgivable.,1
2012,MEL to BKK on day time flight. Departure delayed by passengers who failed to board with their luggage needing to be off loaded. Kept informed of progress. Quicker than scheduled flight meant only a 10 minute delay in arrival. Food was surprisingly good better than domestic business and international premium economy on QF but not international business standard. Beverage selection excellent. You can choose from the entire for sale menu from the economy cabin at any time which gives you access to a much wider selection of mid flight snacks than could be offered on a full service airline. Seat is same as QF domestic business so again not a true long haul business seat. IFE on ipads with enough selection to keep you occupied. The highlight was the service from an enthusiastic and happy crew. This flight exceeded our expectations.,0
2012,Had day from hell arrived at the check in late due to road crashes on the way to Sydney. We were met by a great receptionist who was very sympathetic to all the late arrival people. We were quickly transferred to the next available flight and the holiday was not spoilt. Thank you Jetstar Airways.,0
2012,My partner and I fly with Jetstar regularly choosing them over Qantas because economy seats are more comfortable and the crew generally more friendly attentive and genuine. We are Qantas Club members (corporate) and only have one real complaint about Jetstar. We are able to access the Qantas Club lounge but cannot use the Qantas Club check in facilities. The queues at Melbourne and Sydney terminal 2 are notoriously long and while we all stand there waiting with people stressing and Jetstar staff running up and down the line calling passengers to counters for 'called flights' the adjacent Qantas check in counters (especially the dedicated Qantas Club ones) are empty with staff having lovely personal chats. Why doesn't Qantas Group either use these under utilised counters and check Qantas Club members in or create a dedicated Jetstar queue for these premium passengers instead of constantly annoying us by making us wait for ages. Surely it wouldn't cost too much to implement and would be a fantastic customer service to an already pretty good airline. Just because it's a 'low cost' doesn't mean premium passengers should be treated in a low cost fashion. Also I thought 'leisure airline' was the preferred term for Jetstar - perception is very powerful. Tiger is 'low cost'.,0
2012,Flew them from MEL-AKL flight to AKL was delayed 1 hour because of a baggage discrepancy. Other then that the plane was nice and new staff were friendly. The return flight was on time and arrived a tad early. Was very smooth. On the way there my friend had 6 kg too much carry on baggage but the friendly staff let him off at 5.,0
2012,Flew Gold Coast-Osaka and Tokyo (Narita)-Gold Coast. Excellent value $600 RT each including seat assignments meals iPad rental baggage and QF miles. Seats 54AB OOL-KIX 53AB NRT-OOL. First trip on JQ economy seat pitch is excellent on the A330! More comfortable than a lot of full service carriers. Cabin Crew attentive but not overly intrusive. Chatty FA on OOL-KIX gave us lots of tips for our first trip to Osaka/Kyoto. iPad rental a bit disappointing as content not very extensive. Meals very basic but were included in a prepaid bundle. The 2-4-2 configuration on the A330 is good for couples travelling. Paid $10 for entry to the Gold Coast lounge very basic (soon to be taken over by QF). Used QF lounge in NRT as a QF Gold cardholder good but very busy. Overall a fantastic trip especially bearing in mind QF or JL SYD-NRT were over $1200 per person. Would definitely fly Jetstar long haul again as long as there is a substantial savings and the flight is on the A330.,0
2012,Just today my family took an A321 flight from Melbourne to Hobart. My family moved to our seats and when we sat down we could see food scraps on our seats and on the floor. The plane left at 4pm one hour late and looking like a pigsty. The Captain apologised for the delay and promised free refreshments we then were offered a cup of water.,1
2012,"MEL to HBT on A320 20 Sep. Queued 45 mins for ticketing very slow only 4 staff on duty at Melbourne check-in. Booked with Qantas FF points and could not pick your seats so my wife and I didn't get to sit together not good. Sent to gate 27 to board gates 24 to 30 are in the bowels of the Jetstar terminal under all the other gates in a rough concrete ""bunker"" at ground level which means a walk out to the aircraft and then up steps to board! On board the seats were OK but the space between rows was very tight which is fine for a 1 hour flight but not good for longer. The staff were friendly but not really interested. Only an average experience for our first Jetstar flight will think twice before flying with them again.",1
2012,On the 12 August we eventually flew Auckland to Singapore. The flight was meant to leave at 10.15am. So we arrived at the airport and checked in - nothing said about any delays just that a gate hadn't been assigned and to check the board. Went through customs told the flight information on our boarding passes was wrong - incorrect flight number! The board had a gate but no time! We went to the gate and found other people some of whom had received text messages saying that the flight was delayed until 14.45 or 4.45. After what would have been boarding time some Jetstar staff eventually appeared. First we were greeted with - didn't you hear the announcement! Then we were given - reluctantly - $10 vouchers to keep us fed and watered for the next 5.5 hours. Had we been told this at check-in we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. Jetstar don't allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. When we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldn't be delayed! Then they delayed us as they tried to find 15 missing people - probably the ones who had been told 4.45 instead of 14.45. Never again.,1
2012,Melbourne-Hobart-Sydney. Average service on all flights but very poor ground staff service in Hobart. Staff were very unhelpful and rude. Flight delayed for two hours from Hobart with no prior notifications. Surprised how this is the best LCC in Australia.,1
2012,Well star class we all know - very average. But you get what you pay for. MEL-SIN. Flight delayed 1hr. The food they get in MEL is terrible compared what you get coming back from SIN. Service was ok. Seat are bad but hopefully when they get new aircraft's it will be lot better. The iPads they give you are boring. Overall it's a 7.5 hr flight - not that bad. We had another flight with Jetstar Asia to KL and they are just rude. I do that flight 6 times a year. But there cheap and they go to main airport not the Low cost one.,0

2012,I flew with them from Launceston to Sydney. It was a very nice new A320 and the pilot actually told us what he was doing over the P/A. Very nice service good website nice staff. Would fly Jetstars A320s over Virgins old 737s any day.,0
2012,Flew MEL-MCY-MEL for a holiday on the Sunshine Coast. A computer problem at Tullamarine created long check-in queues but staff were checking to make sure waiting passengers did not miss departure deadlines and our flight left on time and arrived a tad early. Seating is a bit squashed but as to be expected from a budget carrier. Cabin crew were cheery and helpful. Didn't bother with the food. Return flight on time and uneventful. All in all value for the money.,0
2012,SIN-MLB night flight. Originally purchased economy ticket and received Jetstar proposal for upgrade for $200. Accepted. Very good flight: on time comfortable good meals nice staff acceptable entertainment. Particularly appreciated noise reduction earphones and inflatable neck supporting pillow in the amenities pack. Have flown three more legs (MLB-SYD SYD-DRW and DRW-SIN) in economy and all flights were OK: on time and with sufficient leg room (I'm quite tall). Overall very positive. Based on this experience and my judgement of frequent flyer (> 700000 miles) highly recommendable.,0
2012,Perth to Cairns return. Would not recommend Jetstar - the only reason we went on it is because no other airline flies direct to Cairns. It all started before we even got on the plane. Could not check in after driving for 5 hours from the country. Jetstar only do check in's 2 hours prior to flights which means a massive line and wait. Get on the plane and the seats are ridiculously small and had quite a large man on one side of me and the passenger in front reclined their chair. Very uncomfortable. The only positive was the Jetstar staff were very good and caring. The return flight wasn't as bad didn't seem as cramped but was on an aisle seat.,1
2012,HBA-SYD-HBA day trip to collect personal items. A big issue at SYD Airport with security. The check-in agent was more than helpful. She left her desk to see if I could get a spirit level through security. No. She escorted me back to her check in desk and we packed said item into checked luggage. The agent then added Fragile labels to my luggage. This service is more than anyone would ever expect from a LCC. The flight? Usual excellent in-flight service: politeness and efficiency.,0
2012,"Flew round-trip from Singapore to Siem Reap in August 2012. I checked in online a few hours before and saw that my ticket was for ""no baggage."" If I wanted to check a bag at the airport the cost would be $70. They limit carry-ons to 10 kg. My bag - perfectly acceptable by most airlines was 10.4 kg. I was informed had I bought my ticket on their website I could have paid just $20. The fare was not inexpensive either. So much for ""low-cost"" airline. Customer service is horrible.",1
2012,Upon taking advantage of the 'special' deals that Jetstar advertise through the media I was disappointed to find that there were extra charges for seat baggage and absolute robbery of credit card fees. Upon checking in my baggage was one kilo over the 15 kgs I paid for upon checking in and I got fined $60 for the fault. The line for getting onto the plane was absolutely terrible with only one staff member taking the ticket stubs it took over 25 mins to get onto the plane.,1
2012,"BNE-TSV 18th August on A320. Assigned the same seat as someone else - I was willing to change to a spare window seat but the crew made the other person (and his wife) move because of ""zoning"" (for meals?). This left an empty middle seat for the flight. Pushed out ahead of time landed a few minutes early - the estimated flight time was way off (about 10 minutes in a 2 hour flight). Seats very comfortable for short trip - wider than I expected and plenty of legroom. However there are no pockets to store loose items such as books or cameras. Beverage service non-existent unless you paid for it - I was expecting at least free tea and coffee for all as one of the conditions in the booking I made but that didn't happen. Cheap price for the fare but this cheapened the actual flight experience. At least I got a free mug of water when I asked for it. Didn't bother with an entertainment iPad. Safety briefing fine but in-flight announcements from the flight deck were somewhat muffled and almost totally inaudible as a result. Good value for money and I would recommend on that basis alone.",0
2012,"Screaming kids all the way Melbourne to Singapore. Staff did nothing about them toddlers were allowed to run up and down the aisle disturbing other passengers. Bought 3 tickets 6 months ago with assigned seating in row 1. We were all bumped off our seats when we went to check in. Wondering why we were moved from row 1 a very rude staff member barked at me saying ""there are babies on this flight so we need the bassinets seats"". Well on boarding there were no babies in row 1. Seats were cramped and no leg room whatsoever once seat in front is reclined. Audio selection was very poor on some strange ipad type of unit. Beware of Jetstar business class absolutely dreadful.",1
2012,MEL-SYD return. Both flights delayed 30 mins. Seat pitch on A320 on the way up very tight. Lucky had empty middle seat. Ok for short flights but for anything longer than 2 hours very uncomfortable. A321 on flight back. Seat pitch marginally better. Both flights very smooth and cabin crew did their jobs ok.,1
2012,SYD-NAN. We were delayed 1 hour. The actual flight itself was reasonable but until someone's bottle of water dripped on my husband and other fellow passengers from the overhead compartment. Cabin crew cleaned up the water and were friendly. The new iPads for inflight entertainment was great. It is great to keep the kids entertained during the flight. Food was nice and the seats were also comfortable. Overall a good flight with Jetstar.,0
2012,Travelling domestically and flight was delayed for 3.5 hours. Never once were passengers advised of why flight was delayed or when it could be expected to depart. Constantly changing departure times up on electronic displays. Staff surly and uninformed as to details of delay or when flight was to depart. Customer service and simple communication seriously lacking. 3rd bad experience. Will never fly them again.,1
2012,Having gained my seat allocation and boarding pass online my partner and I made our way to Brisbane airport. The flight we had booked was JQ487 leaving at 19.55pm. Arrived in plenty of time and heard the first call to get seats. Made our way to the gate where a rather nasty young blonde woman stopped us to say our bags were too big for hand luggage. She insisted we stop and measure my partners bag. Once we boarded every overhead luggage compartment had luggage identical to mine and my partners all the same size and shape. I do not appreciate the rudeness of the crew who are paid for customer service. The only thing that saved the flight was the apology made by the steward who gave good service. Your flight staff are great but ground crew a lot to be desired!,1
2012,Melbourne - Launceston. Staff rude and not interested in passengers. No boarding call made and had to run to gate after hearing the final boarding call. Plane delayed further as they hadn't fuelled the aircraft. Seat pitch very poor and seat uncomfortable. Hardly any legroom. Food and Beverages ok. Just like any other airline same old food. I would not recommend Jetstar.,1
2012,Booked and paid for Qantas tickets return SYD-HNL. On arrival at Honolulu airport we found out we were in fact flying Jetstar. After taking our seats we were told that as we were Qantas passengers we would be getting a comfort pack 2 meals and 2 drinks. Asked for an iPad each to watch movies but were told we needed to pre-book them. There were spare consoles but they were for the passengers who had paid for them in case they had battery issues! When the meals came around I asked for a water and a juice but was told flatly that I could only have one cold and one hot drink how ridiculous! Cabin service was non existent when the steward eventually came to take our order they had run out of Diet Pepsi with 4 hours still to go in the flight. The best thing about the flight was getting off the plane and getting on the Qantas plane back to Brisbane. What a pleasant change in the staff from glum to cheery. Never again Jetstar!,1
2012,AKL-SIN-KUL return. Flight itself was good. Seat was comfortable though the leg rest on the seat of the return flight was not as adjustable as the outward flight. Meals were ok as airline food goes. Glad we paid the extra to fly business. Only snag we had was the booking we made. Our return flight from K Lumpur to Singapore and onto Auckland we were told that we had to go through immigration collect our bags go through customs then check in again and go through immigration again to board our flight from Singapore to Auckland! Though we were travelling with Jetstar right through they couldn't check our bags through to Auckland. Reason given was the booking numbers. Wished that we were told when we booked with Jetstar. Luckily it happened in Changi Airport as they are super efficient that we managed to do that with little stress.,0
2012,DRW-DPS-DRW. Check-in quick. Staff polite and helpful. Departure slightly delayed due to late arrival of aircraft from southern port. Flight uneventful. Ordered a sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. Check-in at DPS was quick. Counter staff very helpful and polite. Flight left early. Very smooth and quiet. Arrived in DRW early. Baggage available quickly. My major concern is that Jetstar frequently either cancels or delays flights for no apparent reason. Getting to and from anywhere on time seems to be a matter of luck.,0
2012,Purchased sale fairs to Japan from Sydney to Tokyo via Cairns. A330 is far better then the single body A320 as the seats recline further and are wider. Seats are comfortable and roomy. Paid food and good and tasty while the paid entertainment is a bit scarce in options. All flights were on time.,0
2012,"Had a flight from Dunedin to Auckland. Scheduled to leave at 1900 left at 2050. Seems they were short of a steward. Classy (not) scanning of boarding passes. I have never heard ""OK [giggle] you can all go now."" Then waiting for a shuttle at AKL with a passenger from Wgtn (also on a flight with a long delay). Seems she was told the same story of being short of a steward. Two domestic flights delayed for hours with the same excuse. What is going on?",1
2012,Star Class SYD-HNL-SYD 5/7/2012. Being bumped from the allocated seat I had purchased 6 weeks before my flight. I took my 86 year old mother for a family holiday. Because she is frail I am 190 cm tall and my wife needs to care for my 8 year old son we delayed our holiday for several days in order to secure the 3 aisle seats we needed. Can you imagine the humiliation I suffered in front of my mother and other passengers when after we had taken our seats the ground staff came into the cabin and demanded I move to a middle seat or else the plane's takeoff would be delayed. In order to avoid a fuss my mother agreed to move to the middle seat. However as soon as the meal service ended the passenger who demanded my aisle seat fully reclined the two seats in front of my mother so his 3yr old and 6 yr old daughters could relax. Because the armrests on the StarClass seats are fixed in position mum was trapped in her seat until the next meal service 7 hours later! To be fair the aircrew were great and handled this unpleasant situation very well. I do not understand how an airline can advertise that you can pay for seat allocation and then not honour the terms of their contract. Let alone humiliating myself and making my mother very uncomfortable during the flight. Unfortunately because of the limited number of StarClass seats on these long haul flights we were unable to fly StarClass on the return leg or rent an ipad to entertain my son because they only load 47 units on long haul flights from Honolulu even during school holidays.,1
2012,"HKG-SIN on July 13 2012. Almost four hour delay. Seats cramped no inflight entertainment. I paid for checked in luggage seat selection and even food. For the price I paid for a meal I got two drinks and a plastic box of heated junk. I expected a tray like a normal airline meal. With all the add ons it was no longer ""low fare"". Value was non-existent. We had to take the bus at the terminal to the far end of the airport. Since many people don't want to pay for checked-in luggage overhead bins overflowed. By the time we got into the cabin it was past the time for taking off. I have a roundtrip ticket and I dread using the return portion from Singapore to HKG and go through another 4 hours of sheer misery and utter discomfort.",1
2012,Sydney-Honolulu-Sydney in Business class! We selected Jetstar as Hawaiian and Qantas both use 767's versus the A330 Jetstar operates. No airline offers full flat bed seats so it made sense. Maybe Jetstar changed from Star class to business as they were not able to make us feel like stars. The all leather seats give you no support no pillows are provided all you get is a DIY blow up neck ring. The crew was running through the cabin with the attempt to avoid any eye contact with passengers. Coming back we had a great crew a vastly improved experience which made the poor seating and lack of room not as bad after all. For extra comfort we purchased our own pillows and did not bother blowing up the neck ring! Departure and arrival times where spot on. The I-pad tablets are just OK can't wait for the 767's to retire and the 787 coming into service!,1
2012,Star Class SYD-HNL-SYD 11/6/2012 return 21/06/2102. Check in easy crew fantastic. I'm 6ft 4in plenty of legroom better than Qantas 747 Premium Economy. Enjoyed Qantas club both in Sydney and Honolulu food was good.,0
2012,Perth to Bali. This must be the worst airline that I have ever travelled with and I have not even left the ground yet! I make the booking for a pleasant time of day and even pay extra for the privilege then within a week they reschedule it to a horrible time. After four phone calls and several weeks of aggravation they finally manage get a booking on a flight leaving at 9 am - OK not a bad time. Then we arrive at the airport to be told that they have transferred our Aircraft to a domestic route and we are rescheduled from 9 am to 4 pm - OK Bali at 8 pm hotel at 10 not bad. Then an hour later they reschedule to 7 pm departure! Midnight at the hotel and a days leave wasted and I have not left home yet!,1
2012,"I flew PER-MEL on 1st July. The flight boarded well ahead of the departure time but sat at the gate for 45 minutes probably because the Qantas systems were down that day and Qantas passengers were being shuffled onto our flight. We made up time and arrived early. Cabin crew were led by a Staff Development Manager so were on best behaviour. A reviewer below mentioned that all other Australian airlines have 30-33"" seat pitch - I'm not sure this is quite true (Tiger run the same aircraft type with the same number of seats and some Virgin seating is very tight these days) but some seats are definitely better than others. What I don't understand is why they only run A320's to Perth - these are the longest domestic flights and according to the website their A321s and A330s have more generous seat pitch.",0
2012,JQ926 BNE-CNS. The flight had no entertainment which I knew so I just brought my own food on the plane for my entertainment and to eat. The flight with your own entertainment is great.,0
2012,Myself and partner flew Sydney to Cairns return. From the international terminals we could purchase sandwiches and muffins on the forward trip but they only had Mars bars or crisps on the return trip at 7am in the morning. Pretty ordinary for a 3 hour flight. The seat in economy on the A330 are very tight my knees were on the seat in front flight attendants never smile. Never again.,1
2012,MEL-HNL via SYD. Jetstar insist that their own international passengers claim their bags at Sydney domestic and then carry them across to International although they will check bags through for American Airlines passengers! In fact nowhere on the ticket is it mentioned that passengers have to make their own way from the domestic terminal in Sydney to the international - either a bus or a train fare away. The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid. I would suggest that elderly passengers in particular stay away from Jetstar International if their flight involves a domestic connection because Jetstar will require them to claim their own luggage and check in again at the connection point.,1
2012,JQ038 to Bali and Back. The seats were awful. They are so tight once the person in front reclines you have to recline your seat. We paid for all the extras the food was very limited so we had to buy food anyway they forgot our comfort pack and in fact we found later into the flight they gave it to someone else who hadn't paid for it. The entertainment was very limited and the sound quality was terrible. The staff were non existent and inattentive.,1
2012,I just returned from Hawaii on jq3/4 and would like to say what a good flight both ways. The crew were delightful and the seating very comfortable. There were long lines at the check in and there were long lines at the other airline check in counters but they moved along and were very efficient. The biggest problem I observed was the minority demanding public that seem to think it was their right to have everything go their own way. I can only imagine that it was this mob that left their seating space like a tip once we had disembarked.,0
2012,"My wife just booked flights and made a mistake booked flights on the right dates but the wrong way round. I rang jetstar to see if they could help me out to change these flights around to the right departure and arrival. I have flown with them for 4 years and when I speak to someone to get it changed they try to charge me $150 more than what it would cost me to rebook and lose the money I first booked with. All I got was ""it's policy"" nothing we can do but we are helping you the best way we can. It's ok when they change my flights have flights late with no word of a sorry or explanation.",1
2012,I've flown Jetstar many times and over the last half dozen flights have opted for business class seats. On 11th June we returned from Phuket to Sydney once again in business class. I have to say the food provided on this flight was very disappointing. Very little difference to what companions were given in economy class. Bland tasteless muck. We did have metal cutlery! Once the meal was served the attendants seamed to disappear and even getting a fresh bottled water was a chore. I'm not convinced the extra cost over economy is actually good value. The seats are comfortable if you're above average height and you do get off the flight first upon arrival making it quicker at immigration. overall though I think they need to lift their game. In their favour I did think the food quality was better on the Sydney to Thailand leg maybe they need to look at the suppliers in Thailand?,1
2012,"You can't check-in until 2hrs before flight. But you must check in at least 1/2 hr before - no exceptions - or then you lose your ticket. This means check-in counter staff are idle until each flight opens - then bombarded - by the people who are all waiting just outside the check in queue anyway. They usually don't use air- bridges so you have to walk in the weather across the tarmac. You kind of expect that on a little Dash-8 at a regional airport - but not on a big jet in a capital city. As per Jetstar website seat pitch on the A320 is 28"" - not 30"". All other Aussie airlines have 30-33"". That makes a big difference on a 5.2hr flight BNE-PER. Seats only recline about 4 degrees back as a result. You can't even get a drink of water for less than $3.50. No room in overhead lockers because they're full of carry-on luggage from those who won't pay $18 for checked luggage - but will happily pay for numerous $7 bourbons en-route. You can't move to spare seats because they are sold to someone. The worst aspect: You can't check your bags through on multiple domestic flights (only on some international). You have to get your bags after each flight and then re-check for the next flight and re-clear security. A pain when there's 5 hrs between flights (remember - can't check in until 2hrs before) but worse if your flights are close & first flight is late. For inflight entertainment you do have the option of paying $10 for an iPad but these are limited.",1
2012,Flight: In last month. Travelled CNS to KIX return in Business Class. Service was ok. However the cabin team leader had a bit of an attitude problem. My wife's side of the plane go to choose bread types etc while I had the team leader giving service and you got what you were given. After meal was served crew were scarce and spent time gossiping in galley. The thing that irritated me the most was the fact people were allowed children on their knee in business who screamed thru the whole trip. As far as I'm concerned you pay the extra for piece and quiet. I have travelled this service 6 months previously and thought the service had dropped since then. Although the fares were very cheap I would rather pay more and receive superior child free service.,1
2012,"Flight: In last month. Brisbane-Cairns. Check in desk forgot to give boarding passes to two elderly passengers sitting nearby us. They had to walk outside security and re check in. The plane arrived into Brisbane 30 minutes late and we sat on the tarmac for an extra thirty minutes awaiting ""paperwork"". It is a budget airline after all so I did not expect much on board service and my expectations were met. Would only book this airline if it is significantly less expensive than the competitor airlines.",1
2012,Sydney-Denpasar return Business class. Was glad it was only a 6 hour flight each way. The cabin crew tried hard but it seems to lack the refinement of other airlines. Crew really helpful. Seats comfortable. Avoid window seats because once the row in front reclines it's a big effort to get out. Food and wine okay. Entertainment limited with personal sets. I guess you get what you pay for. For the short trip it was worth it.,0
2012,I recently tried Star Class fom Auckland to Singapore. It was either that or travelling Singapore Airlines in economy class for the same price. I have to say that Star Class was much better value. The seats were fine. The meal service choice was good - had a delicious lamb casserole. The staff were attentive and I had trouble getting extra drinks. The on demand entertainment system worked fine and the choice was okay. Overall I found the experience was good. The only gripe I had was the unseat power failed halfway during the journey. Overall the experience was good I will certainly fly Jetstar Star Class again.,0
2012,AKL-SIN. Auckland-Singapore on A330. Plane is clean and new. Seats are not the most comfortable though. Since you have to pay for food and for the inflight entertainment system we brought our own food and entertainment so this proved to an enjoyable flight and for a good price. Recommended if you want to save money and don't expect spectacular service.,0
2012,Auckland to Singapore return. Check-in was quick easy and staff were friendly. Plane was ok seats were uncomfortable crew were friendly and helpful. Did not use any services onboard. Brought my own food and crew removed my rubbish. People need to realise that you get what you pay for as a budget airline I think they did very well. Will fly with them again.,0
2012,Flew the Jetstar equivalent of business class this week (SIN-MEL) and was very disappointed hardly any leg room hard uncomfortable seats which do no recline much food quality was poor and selection of on demand movies and TV shows was also severely limited. I asked for a pillow and was told there was a 'blow up one' in the amenities bag. It was an extremely uncomfortable neck pillow and the expected duvet was in fact an old grey blanket. The overall offering from Jetstar just does not come anywhere close to competing with Air Asia's lay flat beds in their Premium Class with pillows and duvets. Jetstar does not even given priority baggage to business class passengers! Definitely not worth paying the extra money stick to economy if flying Jetstar.,1
2012,Launceston-Melbourne return 7th June. Both flights on time or early. A320 clean and flights uneventful. Check-in quick and easy and as usual this is strictly a no frills method of travel one step up from coach travel. Crew friendly to Melbourne but on return trip crew was abrupt and a little rude. I have a disability and they offered me no assistance with my bag in the overhead compartment and seem to avoid me when I am lifting and holding a walking stick. On the flight from Launceston one male crew member was a little more sympathetic but they always seem to go out of their way to avoid dealing with anything other than the norm. I use the airline regularly and the fares are usually reasonable but I am mindful that the crew are usually not interested and do the bare minimum.,0
2012,SYD-HNL Star Class. Typically poor experience on Jetstar. Exceedingly long queue for business class check-in of 45 minutes they were checking in 3 flights using only one counter for business class. Several agents standing around doing nothing. Inflight experience leaves a lot to be desired. Star class bears no resemblance to international business class standards. Seats are much more akin to US domestic airlines first class seats with limited recline limited legroom and a worthless footrest. When the passenger in front of me reclined my knees were jammed against the seat. I measured 6 inches of space between the seatback and the front edge of my seat. Do not be fooled into thinking this class is a bargain at any price. Cabin service was cool and indifferent. Cabin attendants served meals and disappeared for the rest of the flight. Certainly not worth the money and extremely poor value.,1
2012,My wife and myself flew return Brisbane-Darwin on the new A320. What a joke. The seats are flat and hard and the seat backs uncomfortable. Seat pitch is 28 inches. So if you like the seat back in front of you less than a A4 page away just wait until the passenger in front reclines. Trying very hard to be Australia's Ryanair.,1
2012,Flew from AKL-CHC and had a very nice flight. Our plane had relatively new seating which was comfortable. Legroom was acceptable and the crew were friendly and efficient. Online Check-In worked well and allowed us to avoid the queues to drop off our bags. Overall I highly recommend.,0
2012,Melbourne-Newcastle return JQ477 29th May and 474 30th May. Both flights were on time. Tight legroom made a bit more bearable for short flights by having magazines etc behind the headrests rather than jammed up against one's knees. On the forward journey I observed the cabin manager briefing a passenger with mobility issues about safety aspects of the flight. She displayed a truly caring and professional approach and I was impressed. On both flights most people were fairly obviously leisure flyers - I am happy to travel Jetstar when flying for leisure but would not recommend it for business travellers.,0
2012,"SYD-OOL. Arrived at the airport on time. Flight delayed 40 mins because crew had to come from a different aircraft. After crew arrived they did a quick check and started boarding the flight. However cabin crew were very rude. Crew virtually ran down the cabin serving food (I had my wallet out ready to buy something) ""any food would anyone like any food"". Then right in front of my face a massive high five.",1
2012,Cairns-Sydney-Phuket in Business class. Was not allowed to sit in business class on the 3 hour domestic flight but was allocated an exit row on the A330. Not sure why we could not be seated in business like on the other A330 sector. No food or drinks offered on domestic sector. Seats in business are really premium economy and the only inflight entertainment option was an ipad that was only given out after the meal service. Crew were clearly disinterested and one almost barked at me when I dare go to the galley to ask for an apple juice as there were no drinks runs between the services on this 9.5 hour flight.,1
2012,Had the misfortune of flying Business class from Brisbane to Phuket. Booked to fly out of Brisbane at 8am and arrive in Phuket at 10.30pm the same day. We checked our bags in the morning and by 11am the following day Jetstar had managed to get us to Melbourne with no luggage. I understand that issues with delayed and cancelled flights can and do happen but the total lack of communication was unacceptable. Staff basically didn't want to know us and we were left stranded. Totally unacceptable especially for a business class customer.,1
2012,"I have just flown from Melbourne to Sydney and it was the most dreadful airline I have ever flown. The check- in procedure at Melbourne Airport was appalling and I waited over 1 hour just to drop my bags off despite having an e-ticket. Staff were rude and abrupt and when I complained I was told ""this is only your opinion"". The planes are small and cramped and onboard staff were just as rude and treat you like a sheep not customers. The plane was delayed and very dirty as well. Save your money and book another airline even if it's slightly more expensive.",1
2012,I have flown Jetstar for a while now and to be honest you get what you pay for. Gold Coast to Tokyo was great staff good seats fine in star class. Manila to Singapore - no star class on that flight but paid the extra for legroom.,0
