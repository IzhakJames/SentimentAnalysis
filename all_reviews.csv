Upon arrival in Singapore, I found my suitcase badly dented and reported the damaged to Scoot's handling agent, SATS in Singapore. SATS will not handle the damage and directed me to to claim from Scoot Insurance Assessor online. That evening I dutifully submitted the claim with all supporting photos from SATS, boarding pass, etc. Response was prompt however unhelpful, it directed me to claim from my travel insurer which I refused. A reply from the Scoot's assessor requesting the same documents that were submitted in the online claim. Resend. Reply again requesting for same documents. Explained and objected. Reply and requesting for more photos! The whole process made my trip rather unpleasant! I decided to ignore that email. I was only claiming SGD 200 for the 2 year old damaged suitcase.

As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable.

scoot,890800,2024-03-15,1,Australia,Trip Verified,“A disgrace to Singapore”,"Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions.

On the day of my flight I discovered that I would indeed need to extend my stay I. Singapore, so got to the airport early and asked the staff to flex my ticket. They said they couldnt do it in Sydney, but I could do it in Singapore no problems. We landed in Singapore and the service desk said they could only change the ticket for one month and at a high fee, and that I should ring the 24/7 call centre. I rang the call centre and they had a recorded message saying they were too busy and to use the online chat. I spent an hour on the online chat, only to be told I couldn't change it online because I had already flown the first leg, even though that is what their staff told me to do! So I got up and went back to the airport with my wife to check her in, and make the one month change, only to be told by the morning staff that that was impossible and that the maximum I could change my ticket by was one week. The entire time, at every single stage of interaction the staff were grumpy, rude and every person tried to fob me off to someone else. This was also true of the staff on the plane.

It was an excellent alternative to flying normal economy class being good value, good service with the comfort of a smaller cabin, bigger seats and priority check-in etc. The premium cabin has been renamed Scoot Plus some time ago but product remained the same. However, things appear to have changed. The cabin on this flight was dirty, the crew disinterested, the ""one"" complimentary drink served with the meal can no longer be a choice including wine/beer as you can only buy this as apparently the policy has changed and only water, soft drink, tea or coffee can be chose. I was informed I could only buy a wine when the Scoot Cafe opens. The meals were served immediately the flight reached cruising altitude and were being collected before I had even started. The lights were dimmed during the meal service and the crew disappeared. Other passengers started ringing the bell to order from the Scoot Cafe as it seems no trolley was going to appear. I thought selling food and drinks was the way to make money on these budget airlines! The crew freely allowed passengers from the back of the plane to use the one and only lavatory in the front of the premium cabin.

So 2 hours before my flight to Australia I was running back and forth between two Scoot desks to find out what was this about with no luck, no one gave me any info.

Scoot advertises itself as the small subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (""The little sister of Singapore Airlines""). This is certainly correct in terms of content, but it is absolutely misleading. The service Scoot offers has nothing to do with the fantastic Singapore Airlines! Absolute nothing! Scoot is an absolute no-frills airline in its purest form, even worse than Ryanair. The passenger has to pay for everything. It starts when booking with the food on board, continues with extra luggage and seat reservations. If you don't pay for your seat, a seat will be allocated to you during check-in without any choice for you. And, on board, the customers' money continues to be taken out of their pockets. If you want to drink water on board, which real airlines serve free of charge and in abundance to their passengers for health reasons, you have to pay for it at Scoot. There is no entertainment programme on board, not even monitors to track the flight route. If you use your mobile phone, tablet, etc., you will definitely run out of power during a 12-13 hour flight. There are power sockets, but if you want electricity for charging, you have to pay for it. Regarding the service on board: The staff was always friendly and nice. Thank you for that. But, the food is pretty much the most unappealing and uncharitable food I have seen in my life. And it doesn't even taste good. You are given simple, welded food containers and a can of water.

The second flight from Singapore to Berlin should last 13 hours. I thought this plane would be much bigger an comfortable than the one before, but it was exactly as bad. It could fit more passengers, but everything was exactly as narrow. I would get no pillow, no blanket, no screen with movies, no food, not even a glass of water! I never experienced something like this on an intercontinental flight, I thought it was not even allowed. You could of course buy something but totally overprice, like a small cola for 5 euros. Honestly, low cost has gone too far. The seats were as small as the ones of a 2 hours Ryanair flight, but for 13 hours. In addition, it was so unfortunate that I had to sit in the very last row, in which you couldn’t put the chair back, not even just 1 cm.

Our flight from Singapore to London via Bangkok, and according to my booking confirmation, we would remain seated for the short stop in BKK. In reality we landed in Bangkok, everyone had to leave the plane, go through security and then back into the plane 30 mins later. Then we sat there in the plane for 1 hour without much information before the pilot tells us that the plane (787) is not airworthy due to a mechanical error, and they need to organise a new plane. Then we were given a voucher for food and told that a new plane was set up at 8pm, then they said 11pm, then 12am (14 hours later). Everyone had to leave the plane, go through security before scrambling to figure out what to do next. According to their website ""when a flight has been delayed (retiming is the word they use) by more than 4 hours, we have 3 choices: voucher, refund or change flight date."" Fair enough, I want to change the date. But according to airport information, there is no Scoot counter or Scoot staff in the airport until 12 hours later, so calling Scoot is the only possibility other than waiting 12 hours. So I call Scoot twice, because the first operator got disconnected and I have no way of getting back to him, so I have to queue 10 mins again. After explaining that the plane I'm waiting 14 hours for is not currently up in the air, but is in fact delayed (they were clueless and kept on insisting that I must be on the plane, in the air), they would not allow me to change or cancel my flight.

I was left with the only reasonably priced option: Scoot. For today (Mar 12th), their 787 was deployed, and I was rather curious and looked forward to trying it. I had problems with check in at their computer kiosk, was directed to the assistance counter to complete my check in. The lady was not friendly nor very helpful. Never mind, hopefully the flight experience will make up for it. For today, no meals or duty free will be available to purchase. Instead, each passenger was given a bottle of water and a packaged croissant. I was sat the the so called quiet zone, load factor was very low, they still insisted to sit a lady in our seat of 3, where she could have any other seats (all 3 to herself!), not her fault but the airlines. The thing to do would be to move to another empty to give her more room (and myself), I was not allowed to. I was told due to the virus situation, passengers must not move to any seats for tracing purpose later if necessary. As a result, all 3 of us squeezed onto 6 D,E and F, endured a very uncomfortable flight, inside a 30% full cabin, thanks to the cunning arrangement of the check in agent. I had to take Scoot because I had no other choice, and they did not show me that flying with them had any benefits, besides the low price. 787 usually is very nice plane, but when it becomes a Scoot plane, it looked cheap and tattered everywhere, with very tight seat pitch, cabin crew were so so, doing the bare minimum.

There's no in-flight entertainment, but this is acceptable given that it's a budget flight. What is unacceptable is the lack of cabin service. On the first flight, I was told by a crew member that no outside food was allowed. This is unreasonable as I have strict dietary requirements and could consume none of the main meals offered on board. None of the other airlines that I have flown with have ever picked an issue with passengers bringing their own food on board. I tried to buy a packet of nuts with my debit card but the crew first rejected my debit card, and asked for cash or credit card (which I had none), without giving any reasons. Only after I asked for the reasons that I found out that there is a limit of $20 spending on debit cards and they are phasing out debit card payments. I'm certain this wasn't made known to passengers prior to boarding. This is terrible for passengers on long haul flights who aren't aware of this limit, on top of the fact that Scoot does not allow outside food or serve water for free. The return flight was dismal. I had paid for a seat upgrade but found out that my seat could not recline as the button had dropped out. This was obviously a problem that the airline had previously known of, as there was duct tape around the sharp edges around where the button would have been. I highlighted this to the a cabin crew and her response was ""oh ya, doesn't work. Sorry about that"" and tried to walk off! I had to ask if there was a replacement seat, and (of course) there wasn't any in the same seat class. The cabin crew also talk over passengers to each other across the aisles and can come across as quite curt in their instructions / responses to passengers. I get that Scoot is trying to create a young and less formal vibe but there needs to be more courtesy in the way the cabin crew treat passengers.

It's a budget airline so you know you'll get the bare minimum unless you pay more which is fine. I was really disappointed with the meal service, I prebooked a ""meal, drink and snack"". They gave me no choice of drink and would only give me a 350ml bottle of water which I think is really misleading.  The meal was served almost immediately after departure for an 8 hour flight and I was told I couldn't  have it later. The flight left at about 0715 and my meal was a lunch/dinner option yet they served it as breakfast anyway. Refusing to give me an option honestly made it seem like they were rushing them out ASAP to get it out of the way since they already had my money, choosing to not care about what the customer wants, and hoping the unnecessarily early meal would lead to me needing a second meal later in the flight. I fly scoot semi-regularly and will never pre-book a meal again as a result. If it's any cheaper to pre-book it's only by about $1-2, so definitely not worth being misled about the drink and then force-fed the second you get on the plane. The stinginess with drinks doesn't even go away in their business class cabin which I've flown a couple of times in the past. They say you get a complimentary alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink, but upon asking for something like a whiskey and coke, you get told that whiskey is one free complimentary drink, so if you want coke it's a second drink you have to pay for! The only other issue I encountered was with the automatic check-in, where it refused to take my bag several times despite it being well within all the relevant limits. However, even with that delay, it was much quicker than with many other airlines so I can't really complain. I can't really fault the airline otherwise, they do pretty good deals and the seats aren't too bad. There's no inflight entertainment but in this day and age, I'd rather download something on my phone. Just ensure you have plenty of power as you'll be charged if you want to use the USB charger in your seat.

We went to the check in counter to entire, but the counter staff were not even aware that the flight was re-timed. They checked and advised us that the flight departure time will be delayed by 2 hours, but the arrival time will remain the same, which is ridiculous. We went through the customs and went straight to the gate. The gate did not even display the updated flight time. There was no communication to the passengers, all waiting in vain and frustrated. No customer service representative came to address the issue. We called up the call center, which was outsourced, and they too, have no idea that the flight was re-timed. We went to confirm with the lounge staff, who advised us there was in fact a delay of 2 hours, arrival time will be delayed by another 2 hours too. We understand that the delay was due to the earlier flight being delayed, because they were waiting for 8 passengers who were performing their transit. In other words, Scoot opted to delay a whole plane full of passengers, just to accommodate to the 8 people. Very poor decision making and management on Scoot's behalf. While we were on the plane but yet to depart, the plane was being delayed for another hour. We understand that this was due to accommodating to the request of a single passenger who decided to disembark and then changed his mind to reembark again. This decision, again, costed the whole plane full of passengers another hour, just for the sake of a single passenger. We were seeking updates from the stewardess during the delay, but she does not have any clue as to what is happening, and she had this irritating habit of touching her hair once every 10 seconds or so. I missed my connecting flight eventually, and had to book another connecting flight. I wrote in to Scoot for the compensation. Their customer support team is outsourced, and have no clue that the flight was delayed. They kept insisting that the flight delay was less than 3 hours, until I requested them to show me the actual departure time and actual arrival time, versus the scheduled departure and arrival time. They kept replying with copy-and-pasted templates which added to my frustration. They have this ""promise to you"" page on their website which says that they will compensate with a travel voucher for any delay more than 3 hours. It has been more than a month since I raised this claim and till now, it has not been resolved. The issue being transferred from one customer service officer to another. Not too sure if they even intend to deliver this promise that they state on their website. Comprehensive travel insurance does not cover delay of less than 6 hours, but their customer service officer kept asking me to check with the insurance company for compensation.

To Scoot or not to Scoot In just one single trip I have come to the following conclusion about Scoot. There is inconsistency in the way they treat seat luggage allowance wise at different airports which cost us a lot. The web portal crashed multiple times when I tried to book luggage ... in the crash dump it said that they had ""been informed"" ... right. Maybe if the portal had worked I could have paid $105 return for luggage for my son as well instead of the total of $540. The air hostesses seems to look down on people, at least my wife who is kindness incarnated. The air hostesses seemed to have no information on extra seats and who is entitled to use them. The air hostesses apparently just assumed that we were getting off in Singapore .... the way they handled the stroller part in the story border lines theft of $400 in my books. It was only that I broke a massive sweat to ""pull it from the dumpster"" that I got my property back. The people in service phone has no clue about prices of luggage, again it seems this case falls out of their flow chart. The customer support does not respond, responds consistently only after the 10 days probably to wear you down and will apparently try and make you give up by death by paragraphs ... but I can read and this has become a matter of principle for me. The main issue was the the fact that we got trapped on the return to Gold Coast with luggage conditions that were suddenly different in Bangkok than in Gold Coast. This cost us A$300 extra  but even though thats a lot of money, there is a certain amount of unfairness to it which is why I am making my voice heard. I have written to Scoot regarding the excess luggage and waited the 10 days without a reply from them. Then I wrote again and have waited another 10 days without hearing anything. But then I heard from them with the following message: ""Our record shows that you have purchased an extra seat for your infant, however, infants are not considered as a full paying passenger. You may refer to our Conditions of Carriage 3.3 regarding infant passenger."" In fact under baggage allowance it says ""Infants not occupying a seat have no Checked Baggage allowance"" which must mean that our son, since he occupied a seat either had a checked baggage allowance or at least was allowed to have one. So, they seem they will do anything to deflect. I have written to them with this argument.

I have never encountered more unhelpful and incompetent people in my whole life than those who work at scoots call centers and airport transfer desks.  I tried to check my bag in online but the website links did not work, the app did not work, and it took 30 mins to get through to call center. The representative put me on hold after every question because it was clear he did not know how to answer basic questions. Finally, he informed me bag would have cost 400 Singapore dollars if I had checked it in at the airport counter! And this is insane considering how extremely difficult it was for me to check it in ahead of time with none of their websites or apps working properly.

I also tried to check in through Scoot’s app 3 hours before flight. To my panic, the app said that my flight had already departed which was entirely not true since it was 3 whole hours early!

I suggest next time this reviewer takes time to check Scoot's terms and conditions, as clearly outlined on the website, and the instructions on the food package. Like the reviewer, I had a choice for my flight. My choice was to fly business class with Scoot for $100 less than a 'full fare; airline charged for a seat in economy. This is cash i would rather have in my back pocket than frittered on pointless trivialities and trinkets I can live without. Taking things as I found them, check-in was rapid - Scoot had a similar number of check in desks open for a 787 as Emirates were prepared to provide for an A380, with consequential length of queue. Boarding was smooth, departure more or less on-time departure with an early arrival in Singapore. Staff were friendly and keen to assist passengers wishing to access the IFE. Food was OK, especially the chocolate, with a wider choice of beer than many other airlines offer. One gripe, though this seems to a common issue with the B787: the passenger cabin was far too cold. However, knowing in advance what was (not) on offer in the way of a blanket, I came prepared with a body warmer. Departure from Singapore on the connection was likewise on time with similar levels of service, my checked bag safely delivered along with myself in Bangkok.

The 3 emergency exit seats in the middle row were empty. After take off, I moved to the empty seats in the middle because I was unwell. I did this because I wanted to lie down, I wanted to be in closer proximity to the bathroom and I wanted to distance myself from the other passengers. Two staff initially asked me to move because the seats I was sitting on cost extra. This seemed like an uneconomical use of space considering there was no way for the airline to make money from these seats after the plane had disembarked. I explained that I had paid for an emergency exit seat but had moved to this row because I was unwell. They understood and let me stay. I woke up half way through the flight, moved back to my original seat and tried to eat something. After eating I felt a sharp pain in my abdomen, so I moved back to the same empty row to be closer to the bathroom. This time I sat upright, cross legged on the seat. An air hostess named marched up to me and demanded I move back to my old seat. When I asked her why I couldn’t sit in an emergency exit seat closer to the bathroom she simply said it was ‘company policy’ that these seats remain empty. She couldn’t elaborate any further except to say that the pathway to the bathroom was not allowed to be obstructed. I moved back to my assigned seat but expressed that I was sick. Instead of empathising with me, she treated me as though I was being dishonest. She aggressively asked me if I had a fever. I said I did not but I had other unpleasant symptoms. She demanded I list all my symptoms in front of the other passengers. I asked her if it was really necessary to openly list all my symptoms because it was embarrassing for me. This did not appeal to her sensibilities and, once again, she demanded to know what my symptoms were. I listed my symptoms in front of everyone. This was very humiliating for me. She then said I should have told the staff I was sick at the beginning of the flight. I informed her that I had done this. She then told me I could lay down on the vacant seats but not sit up. It made no logical sense. Nate said she would tell the Captain and alert the ground staff. She delivered this as though it was a threat but I agreed this was ok because I had nothing to hide.  When the plane landed a medic was called on board. The medic asked me one question - do I have a fever? I said no and he immediately let me exit the plane. He said that he only needed to be called on board if I had a fever in the last 24 hours.

I had to shift some luggage to my hand luggage to prevent paying for overweight. In the end it doesn’t matter because the same weight is going onboard. No wonder it took ages at check-in if they do this for everyone. I paid extra for the quiet ‘child free’ cabin in front of the aircraft. Rows 4 to 8 are supposed to be quiet but it doesn’t add any value because there’s no bulkhead and with kids seated in rows 9 and 10 I wouldn’t call it a quiet cabin. They strictly enforce the ‘no own food and drinks’ policy onboard. Like a strict teacher a member of the cabin crew passed by every few minutes to tell passengers they were not allowed to eat food not purchased onboard. This was forbidden according to Singapore law. Just a lame excuse because there is no such law and it’s just a company policy to generate more revenue. Don’t order meals online because you pay 15 US Dollar, while onboard it will cost you only 15 Singapore Dollar. I ordered a hot meal and a soft drink onboard. According to their menu it costs 18 SD, because you get 1 SD discount when you order a meal and a drink in once. I was charged 19 SD. I told them it should be 18 SD but they insisted it was 15 for the meal and 4 for the drink. Pointed them to their own menu and then I got the excuse that I should have ordered the combo deal instead of the meal and the drink. They simply do not think logically because it’s exactly the same. In the end I paid 18. There’s no IFE onboard, not even a screen with the flight time, arrival time, etc. The only entertainment is looking out of the window, which they also ruin because immediately after takeoff the windows are blinded until shortly before landing.

First flights on Scoot in their ScootBiz cabin, which is misleading as it is very much a premium economy product. On balance it was a good experience, and in line with my expectations. Both flights were punctual, check in and boarding were reasonably efficient (you'd expect such at KIX, less so at DMK, but both were good). I was quite impressed with the cabin crews - they were very professional, warm and efficient. Seats were comfortable enough, although don;t expect lie flat, just a bit more recline. The only real negatives were 1) quirky IFE which runs on your laptop, tablet or phone - despite multiple downloads of plugins, flash players, etc I encountered compatibility problems throughout with hardware, browsers, etc and ultimately just gave up - this is far harder and more complicated than it should be, 2) on the outbound flight DMK-KIX the biz cabin was filled with babies and infants (due to school holidays in SG and MY I am guessing). I actually had a mum with lap child in the seat next to me and there is no way the child was under two years old (ie - needs a ticket). With all of the crying/screaming, etc I voluntary downgraded to the economy 'quiet zone', where the crew gave me a full row to myself - felt it was the right decision and appreciate the crew's assistance in ensuring my comfort. It is ironic though that Scoot charges more for economy passengers to sit in a quiet zone, yet offers no comparable alternative for biz passengers who are paying more money for their seat - this makes no sense to me, and 3) the whole idea of paying for in seat power (economy only) is another example of the pay for play model of low cost carriers, and suspect will be more broadly adapted by competitors. To summarise, the experience was good, not great, but acceptable. One additional insight re AirAsia X, Jetstar and Scoot long haul - Jetstar and Scoot are very similar experiences (both Dreamlines with 2-3-2 configuration with limited recline - Air Asia X the better product due to their flat bed offering on the less attractive A330.",Boeing 787,Business,Premium Economy,Bangkok,Osaka,,December 2018,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,yes,1.0

The email contained several links for various responses. As I had booked and paid for an extended legroom seat to mitigate a back complaint that I suffer from, I was concerned when I read that all pre-booked anything such as seats, meals or other services had simply been cancelled.

I have never been more frustrated in my life dealing with anything, as I have trying to get a fair customer outcome with Scoot. I had booked two seats with extra legroom for my wife and I, as we had a young infant flying with us and needed extra room. Without notice, they had changed the aircraft we were flying on, and the seats I had chosen were not extra legroom seats any more, they were just ordinary seats.  There were more spacious seats available, but the crew insisted we had to pay to change to them. Anyway, that was not the frustrating part. Ever tried to get a refund from Scoot? I will tell you it is probably impossible. You would think it is straight forward: I paid for extra leg room seats -> they did not give me extra leg room seats -> therefore I should get a refund? Not so simple. I had paid $158 for the extra leg room seats, they told me they cannot refund me the whole amount as I had selected seats during the booking process so they had to charge me a seat selection fee (something like $20). I proceeded to tell them that the only reason I selected the seats were because I wanted extra space as we had an infant with us, not because I liked 11D and 11E. ""Sorry sir, it is our policy"", but they cannot actually point to this policy in any of their policy disclosure documents. No one I spoke with seemed to understand the basic concept that if I pay for a service and do not receive what I paid for, I should get a refund. They said they will escalate it and call me back. Three months had passed, no call. I call them back, have to re-explain myself, and they said they will escalate and call me back. This went on for a year (can you believe that). I have called again today, and concede just to refund me whatever they saw fit, guess what? They are escalating and calling me back soon. Oh and another thing, Scoot will never give you a cash refund, only in Scoot vouchers. Why would I fly scoot every again after an experience like this? This is the hardest I have ever worked for $158 of vouchers.  I guess that is what you expect from a budget airline.

She apologised and went the extra mile and took the initiative to offer me hers even though I didn’t ask for it. During the flight, she was seen helping 2 elderly couple in front of us with the Scoot tv app. She kept coming back to check on them and it was when meal service was about to start. I understand that’s a very busy period for crew but she was professional and very patient with them and assisted them for at least 20-30 minutes and had left me very impressed. She was also always seen in the cabin during meals and duty free sales service. During the lull period, while walking to the lavatory, crew was also polite to inform me that there was a queue.

Service is officious and rigid - even when there were only ten people in the business class cabin they couldn't bring themselves to be flexible on mealtimes. Everything is about the rules, nothing is about the passengers. I don't think that's the fault of the crew - it is probably the management. Trying to check in on line from Tokyo was impossible because the website - whether the JP website or the SIN website - only supplies Singapore as a point of departure, there are no other choices.

This is the worst Airline in terms of service level at the ticketing and pre-boarding service. It is the most opportunistic airline that charges absurdly for the slightest change. I kept getting cut-off in my attempt to call and under the pretext or excuse that the manager's name dealing with my case has to be kept a secret, I could never identify the person whom I am supposed to talk to. Scoot had allowed me to change the passenger for the air ticket that I bought for my daughter. But due to unforeseen circumstances, she cannot join us in our family trip. I had to transfer the ticket to my niece. However, during the several telephone conversation, I have been told that the change fee is between S$80-S$100. However, when I tried to make the change online, I was told it would cost me $400, almost the price of the ticket itself! Plus there would also be a fare difference charge when there is no fare change, no change in date or time or selling away my existing ticket and rebuying another! The $400 change fee comprises S$100 for change of first name, another $100 for change of last name, multiply that by 2 for the return ticket! This is the most absurd charge and the airline refused to budge telling me its in their rule!. Firstly, the rule is absurd and secondly, during all the telephone exchanges, I have only been told it is between S$80-$100 and never $400! The discussion has been going on for 2 weeks now, but there has been no resolution. I feel that I have been held to ransom as I am due to depart in slightly more than a week. I have been using Scoot alot recently. But customer service, goodwill and ethical practice obviously has no place in Scoot's management! I will think doubly hard about ever using Scoot again.

I wanted to fly Thai Airways, however that wasn’t possible. On a timeline scale, I reserved an extra ticket for my Mum in business, as it was on sale at the time. It was only $200 on the first sector, so we brought it. It would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. Initially, I asked for an exit row, and got the best seat, 4J and 4H. However, the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. Once I got on board, the flight attendant at the door greets you,  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. I call the purser, and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. They then say that this was a double seat assignment and that I had to sit in row 15. The seat itself isn’t appealing, and some short haul aircraft have better seats. I could’ve paid extra for seats with extra legroom, but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in, and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. Luckily, the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. But the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse! The most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call button/light switch, awkwardly placed on the armrest. I understand the 787 doesn’t have call buttons on the ceiling, but can’t you find a better place for it? After takeoff, I order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. The lasagne tasted unappetising, while the pasta tasted really bland. A little bit later in the flight, I had Ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. All this food set me back 50 Singaporean dollars. The equivalent amount of food on AirAsia would only cost me a third as much, and also tastes better.  On the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, the staff at the check in were friendly like Japanese people are, and I requested an extra legroom seat, and found out I wouldn’t be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. However, my brother wasn’t allowed to sit there, so we asked if he was allowed to sit in The “ScootInSilence” zone, which he wasn’t allowed to, even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. There was a lady and her daughter talking in Japanese in the counter next to us, and later in the flight, I saw her and her daughter (who looked like she was 10) sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if I had a language barrier, even though the guy at the counter wasn’t Japanese. The crew on this flight were much more friendly, but still considerably cold.

As it was an overnight flight, we were woken up 4 hours before the arrival for our meals, which was a little annoying for some of us whom have given them instructions that we didnt want our meals. From Athens to Singapore, during check in, we realised that our first row seats were given away to customers who did a 150euro upgrade. It was unprofessional of this airline as we booked our seats way in advance, paid much more for our business class seats, and the walk-in customers whom came by the counters, decided to pay for the upgrade with simply 150 euro, and yet they could take our seats which we have chosen beforehand. And we can all foresee, the counter staff, ground staff etc all said they cant do anything about it. We sent in a feedback to Scoot and as we can all expect it, there wasnt any response from them. We met another passenger who also told us that Scoot just cancelled his flight. Word of advice: If you really have to travel via business class seats, choose the first row as the rows 2 and 3 are not worth the heavy price tag.

I like Scoot's 787 aircraft and the Economy class seats are some of the most comfortable around. For point to point travel they are a good deal, but I won't be using them for connecting flights again and here's why. Although Scoot will sell you an itinerary with connecting flights, the transit time can be very long. My original outbound schedule was changed such that it would have taken over 29 hours to arrive in Bangkok. I decided to connect in Singapore to another airline instead. Scoot does have a well-hidden policy for Australian travellers only, which allows for refunds in very limited circumstances - I did eventually get a partial refund on my flight, but only after I involved the Consumer Affairs authorities (and I still had to wait 10 weeks for the money). My return flight was a mere 17.5 hours elapsed, which was just about acceptable. But even though I had only carry on baggage, Scoot forced me to go through immigration in Singapore to get my onward boarding pass (after telling me in Bangkok that I could do this at the transfer desk). System limitations perhaps? Well no, if I had paid an extra $20 for ""Scoot-Thru"" they would have given me my boarding pass. Someone must have thought this was a great idea to make money out of customers, I think of it as a great way to lose customers. Another thing about connecting flights - according to the terms and conditions if you don't pay for Scoot-Thru and you miss your connection due to a delay by the airline, the airline won't help you at all - you've lost your flight! For the Singapore to Perth flight I paid THB970 for a ""super seat"". In extreme cases these seats can give you an extra 4 inches of leg room, but in my case it was only an extra 2 inches compared to my outbound flight - definitely not worth it. Speaking of extra expenses, the food is overpriced and awful. Vegetarian choices are particularly poor - and you're not allowed to bring your own.

The baggage drop-off queue was about 100 persons long since there was only 1 staff-person attending that took 45 minutes of waiting which makes a mockery of doing on-line check-in. The cabin crew spoke poor and heavily accented English even for crucial announcements, and seemed flustered all the time - as when asked any question. They did nothing to stop a parent allowing a child to play with balloons which burst periodically sounding like a gun-shot. Nor did they stop another woman watching a kung-fu movie on her tablet computer without head-phones. By the time one adds the check-in luggage, meals and seat selection, the ticket costs as much as an SIA flight if booked a little earlier. Since they do not have the same facility to check luggage through to a connecting flight, one has to have the expense and inconvenience of entering a transit country immigration-wise just to collect luggage and check it in again when the other airline commenced check-in many hours later. So the parent company gets almost the same fare for an airline operating much cheaper and so makes a greater profit! Seems like the reason for having Scoot is to run it so poorly is to make SIA look better by contrast, and convince passengers pay the slightly higher fare. In compensation for the flight delay Scoot offered a trifling voucher to use on another flight in the near future - a highly unlikely scenario for most.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN,PER,,December 2016,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,

Service on the plane was decent, attendants treated us with good manners and respect, responded to requests promptly, and was generally very accommodating to the passengers. Plane delayed for 8 hrs at Narita, since Scoot didn't have arrangements with other airlines and we didn't receive the notification email before arriving, we had to sit at the check-in area for 4 hours before being allowed to go through security where we spent an additional 5 hours. Flight was scheduled for 7pm departure but by 6:45pm, the plane was nowhere to be seen, they change the departure time at 7pm, very poorly communicated. Meal vouchers were provided, which was a slight plus. Because Scoot uses one plane to fly through 4 different routes (Brisbane to Tokyo to Taipei to Singapore), delays at any of the locations would cause delays to all rest. On top of that, with the tight turnaround schedule, they had no time to clean the planes. The bathrooms were disgusting. The plane seats were dirty,  not exactly the new plane they had advertised. Greediness also comes to mind looking at how much they charged for water/drinks along with their policy of no food on-board. Carry-on luggage policy is what I had serious issues with. We carried on the same amount of luggage arriving to Taiwan as we did departing but we were told we needed to keep the carry-on weight at 10kg and below for each. Why wasn't this policy enforced from Tokyo to Taipei? Instead of taking everything out of our carry-on, we decided to check our luggage instead but then had to pay $20 per kg after 20kg, so additional $200 was paid for carry-on. To make it more infuriating, the overhead bins were empty on the plane, which means, they forced most passengers to check their carry-on. Seating, coming back from Taiwan, for our family of 4, 2 adults two kids 3 and 5, they decided to separate us and had us in different rows on different sides of the plane. Had the plane been completely booked, we would've been fine with it but there were at least 30+ seats available next to each other by the time we departed.

scoot,386242,2016-03-20,1,Singapore,,"""very poor experience""","Overall a very poor experience with Scoot when compared with other budget airlines. It was our first time so we did not realise the biz class seats did not recline much and the leg rest also did not come up. We bought biz cos we thought we would get a better rest on the redeye but instead, passengers in economy were able to take 2-3 seats and lie down while there is a non-movable handrest between the biz seats and my toddler couldn't lie on my lap so ended up being even more uncomfortable. I brought packet oats for my toddler and wanted just a bowl of hot water but even that could not be accommodated. I guess this is budget but I don't know what biz class I was paying for. On the return flight, we missed the cutoff for the checkin counter by 5 min, that is clearly our bad as we didn't know it was 1 hour cutoff (In Singapore mostly 40 min) but what annoyed was the scoot counter staff attitude. It's tough for anyone to miss their flights but they were really mean and rude about it. I then realised the Economy class passengers for this flight were still being checked in and asked why we couldn't then get on but she said its because we were not already in the queue by the 1 hour mark. So it wasn't like the counter had closed which I would fully understand but just for the principle of it. This inflexibility really put me off. Next she tells me too bad, the tickets are non-refundable (we paid $2700 for the 3 tickets - not exactly cheap cos i wrongly thought biz class was worth it). They had no scoot counter at the airport and there is no wifi at the airport. So I had to make multiple long-distance calls to find out tomorrow's flight would cost be another $2k. At this point, I gave up and opted to buy 3 new full-fare ticket on SIA from Brisbane airport. It was a mistake to fly Scoot. Should have just flown a return flight on SIA from the get-go.

Bought the fares on a sale, and even with fees with checked-in luggage, it was about half the cost of a full-service airline. The seats were fantastic - especially for a low cost airline. According to Seatguru economy seats were a generous 18""-19"" wide. This is wider than many full-service airlines. Practically speaking, this could mean a difference between being able to tuck your elbows between the seat handles (instead of clashing with your neighbour's elbow) or not. Leg room was also adequate, although I am shorter than average (5'8""). The ScootBiz seat was, obviously, much more comfortable. But note that it is a Premium Economy, rather than Business offering. It involved reclining wide seats but added utility is limited because the leg rest awkwardly stops mid-calf and cuts off your circulation after a while. The major let-downs were twofold. Firstly, the appalling attitude the ground and especially call centre staff. After talking to them I felt like they were doing me a huge favour by allowing me to fly on Scoot. I get that it's a budget airline, but it doesn't cost much (if at all) to be slightly more courteous. The second is the food. You are not allowed to bring your own food, and you need to buy theirs. Not surprisingly, food is not cheap. But unfortunately, the Nasi Lamak I got was greasy and salty. Bottom line: if you're a budget traveller, they are nevertheless solid.

After checking, I noticed Scoot was a couple of hundred dollars cheaper compared to another major airline. So I booked Scoot and booked only 1 luggage for me and my daughter. A day before our flight, my daughter said she might need an extra luggage so I went to the Scoot website ""Manage My Booking"" Section to purchase an extra luggage allowance. It took me half an hour to get to my booking details because the website could not find my booking reference. Finally after getting to my flight details, I added an extra 10kg on top of my luggage allowance of 20kg and paid $34. I also paid $24 to book our seat numbers. I tried to add meals in our booking but the website said meal booking was not available at that moment. Finally on the day of our departure, 15th January 2016, we went to Sydney airport and the check in guy said our luggage was over the 20kg allowance and I said I booked an extra 10kg the night before. They said there was no extra 10kg booked in our flight and that I have to pay $140 extra for the excess weight. I asked them to double check because I know I paid for it the night before. The woman said they see an extra 10kg booking for our return flight. I asked there was a mistake and if they could fix that problem and apply the extra 10kg allowance for this flight. The woman said in a firm tone there's nothing they can do, I have to pay the extra $140.  Before boarding  we bought a couple of bottled water and after take off I pulled a bottle water out of our carry bag but the flight attendant told us we are not allowed to consume any food or drinks we have with us. I said my daughter is thirsty and the flight attendant told us we have to buy water from them which cost $4 for a very small bottle of water, and we waited for at least 15 mins for the bottled water to be given us. An hour after later, the flight attendants started serving meals to those who were successful in booking their meals. I asked one of the flight attendants if I could buy food and she said we have to wait. We waited for more than half an hour before she came to take our order.

In addition,  I and my friend requested the check-in staff to give us seats in the middle of the plane if possible. The check-in desk staff told us that she is giving us seats 44D/F (My friend on 44D, me on 44E and 44F is empty) and we two can use these three seats.

I highly recommend these. There was plenty of space to the side of the window seat to place books etc. I found the staff pleasant and flights were punctual. I can't comment on the food as I didn't try it but the on-board Wi-Fi was very impressive. Reasonably priced (about £8 for 3 hours if I remember correctly) which kept me entertained. Only negative was the placement of the lighting/attendant buttons on the armrests. Proper design issue there I think. The lack of entertainment was expected so I can't complain but it's probably the only factor that differentiates it negatively from a full service carrier.

Because of route limitations (Narita to Hong Kong), I had to piece my flight together by purchasing each leg individually. While purchasing my flights, I found that even though the basic airfares offered are the same as those sold on other travel websites, it is not obvious until you have completed your initial order that everything else is ""a la carte"" with regards to cost. Since I fly Singapore Air regularly, it was nice that an option to count my Scoot flight on my Kris Flyer account, it was ridiculous that I have to pay extra for this feature ($20-$30 extra). But there are a number of things that Scoot's website either fails to disclose, is not well worded or has hidden on some obscure page on their site requiring hours of searching. One items it that their online check in is only available for flights DEPARTING from Singapore. Additionally, I suggest making sure to double and triple check your travel dates and times since their website did not provide me with a flight on the date and time of day that I had requested (requested Fri evening, was giving FRI AM past midnight schedule instead of making it Sat AM past midnight). For the HK to Singapore leg, I found that Scoot offered a nice comfortable ride, fast boarding (Business Class) and fairly good service from the flight crew. Scoot is definitely an all economy airline since additional beverages beyond what was included with the meal were offered even for purchase. Speaking of the meal, unless you like eating what is similar to cheap frozen microwave meals, I suggest as others have mentioned to bring your own food along. Also the flight crew do not remove the plastic cover before serving you so make sure to drape your napkin across your clothes to avoid splattering yourself. At least the flight crew were nice and friendly and were dressed like flight crew's from the 50's and 60's which was a nice change from the stuffy or garish looking uniforms that other airlines use. As for my Singapore to Narita flight, this is when I learned that Scoot's website made an error with my flight request. Like I noted previously, I had requested for a flight on Friday afternoon or evening specifically and did not realize that it had offered me a flight just past midnight on Thursday evening instead of Saturday. So this is where things got really interesting. First, based on the way the website was worded when I attempting to login and make a flight change 2 days before hand that the site said I could not make any changes until 24 hours before my scheduled flight. So I waited and tried to make the change 24 hours before my flight but was still not allowed to do so. Well like any other traveler, I decided to just call and have the change made over the phone - only to my surprise to learn that I was marked a ""No Show"" because the flight I had paid for had already boarded and was about to depart. Unlike other airlines, the Scoot rep rudely told me that the error was my fault and that their policy was to not refund the cost of the flight especially since I was now marked as a ""No Show"" and became argumentative, so Customer Service is definitely not a strong feature for Scoot.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Singapore,Narita,,November 2015,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,no,

Starting with the booking process, you get the promise of a big seat (not a lay-flat such as AirAsia), free seat allocation, 20 or 30kg of luggage and a premium meal. The meal was terrible - probably the worst airline food I've had. Starting a bit early at Changi airport - we were told bluntly that early check-in would be additional cost - even for Scoot Biz.  Neither is internet and depending on what you read - even the streaming entertainment. Once onboard, I found the extra-large seat to be hard as a rock and only reclined a bit - not enough for a comfortable sleep. Yes, it was better than economy seating, but not much. And after 5 hours of flying, a request for a 100ml cup of water was denied - the Scootie insisting that I had to pay for drinks.

scoot,349967,2015-10-21,2,Singapore,,"""no more Scoot for me""","Seoul Incheon to Singapore via Taipei. Scoot flight was fairly uncomfortable for me both to and fro. The seats were stiff and uncomfortable, there were no meals provided for 8 hour flights, they had to be purchased separately. The flight back from Korea was delayed for 2 hours, everyone who had to detour in Taipei was stuck for 2 hours and this was in the midnight 1-3am. I felt very sorry for a little girl who was extremely tired but since we arrived late from the Korea flight there were no seats left at the waiting area in Taipei so she had to sleep on the ground with her bag under her head. Both times I boarded the flight, both arrived late. No compensation was offered and the pilot claimed it was due to Taipei's runway being closed. Personally, I did not feel that the announcement sounded apologetic, it seemed more like an excuse to me. Afterall, the flight was already an hour late upon arrival in Taipei so clearly whatever the runway issues were the late arrival had nothing to do with it. A more comprehensive view of all the problems with my trip with Scoot. It was booked by my company therefore I was not given the choice to pick. When I checked the itinerary the first thing that alerted me was no 25kg check-in baggage. My boss' secretary booked it and when I asked she mentioned she did not know it was not provided because she assumed that all international flights would include it. Therefore, we had to pay for the baggage which eventually summed up to cost even more than Vietnam Airlines which already included the baggage fees (I did a price comparison on my own). I was sent on a two week business trip which required me to ship a laboratory equipment back. Another problem cropped up when I was supposed to ship the parcel back. I was paged by one of the airline personnel to the boarding gate. She informed me that the parcel has been detained because it does not fit the airline regulations. Firstly, like all the other normal, regular people, I do not read all the airline regulations although I have a rough understanding of what is allowed and what isn't. This knowledge obviously does not comprise of laboratory equipment and other aspects which are uncommon to be brought on board - if there was a problem they should have alerted me during the check-in of my bag, not when I am about to board a plane. The staff then told me I have to leave the equipment behind. She was pretty rude, trying to shove her piece of airline regulation in my face telling me that the specifications for the equipment exceeds those of the airline regulations. I am not Korean and the manufacturer's description were in Korean. I told her to open it and read it herself and I have no problem with that. She told me they already did and I just cannot check this in. She did not give me any solutions to my dilemma. What I got from her was basically, ""Miss, the airline does not allow us to take this on board, so please just dump it here and get on your flight."" I was obviously very annoyed by this as I had paid for the excess baggage. So I told her if the baggage is now left behind, I should at least be refunded for my baggage fees. She gave me a downright no. There was no effort being put into trying to make the customer happy. She didn't even offer to ask.

Why would anyone waste an extra A$200 plus one way for less comfort? Staff were friendly but the design of the light and call buttons (and 'cancel call' button) in the armrest meant they frequently went to seats where passengers had mistakenly pressed it. Which designer thought of this? The meals are horribly expensive and a small icecream (we'd call it a 'buddy' in Australia) was an extortionate A$6. I brought my own water filled at Sydney Airport after passenger screening: a small Evian bottle on board was an outrageous A$4 with no free tap water available.

scoot,265266,2015-05-20,8,Australia,,Scoot customer review,My Daughter and I flew Singapore to Perth 3 weeks ago. My Daughters baggage was over by 5 kgs so the check-in lady allowed her to remove heavy items and take on board as hand luggage which was great. Knowing that there was no entertainment we had a book and magazines to read and had a snooze. We bought subway at the airport and took it on board to eat. The flight attendant told us it was not allowed but to quickly eat it - which we did. We had no issues with the seats the flight was early arriving into Perth which we were pleased about. All in all a great flight which we could not fault and would definitely fly Scoot again for a cheap flight of $192.00 each.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,0.0
scoot,265267,2015-05-13,2,Australia,,Scoot customer review,I was on the very first flight out of the Gold Coast to Singapore and felt compelled to write this review. Originally it was a great service with great customer service but all seems to have changed. The seats are uncomfortable the staff are unhelpful and the overhead light and crew call button is on the seat arm and keeps coming on due to just resting your arm on the arm rest. It is cold on all flights I have been on probably to get the passengers to buy Scoot blankets. My daughter recently flew to Singapore and her credit card didn't work for some strange reason. She only had a Travelex card and no cash which meant she was unable to purchase any food or drink. This is not a major problem but just inconvenient. What was deeply concerning was that the crew refused to let her have a glass of water for the whole 7+ hours! I have found the food to be unhealthy and average considering they are not charging insignificant amounts for any of it. Another word of advice is never change your flight unless you have to! They basically charge you almost the same again to change dates. It feels very much as though they have come up with a great concept and then decided to take advantage of any need such as food water warmth and entertainment and charge for it whilst providing the bare minimum of comfort. Like most airlines they even charge you a processing fee for the convenience of paying them. There is no other way to pay so they are guaranteed income from this. Then they have the add on's such as car hotel insurance and so it goes on! Overall an airline that has a great route from the Gold Coast to Singapore seems to have unfortunately turned into an uncomfortable and unreasonable airline. I will use the service in future due to convenience but not look forward to it as I have in the past! Incidentally I would have given them high scores on all aspect in the beginning except for perhaps the food. It may be better to just get the train to Brisbane and fly out from there in future.,,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,1.0
scoot,265268,2015-05-08,6,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,"TZ6 Singapore - Gold Coast on 777. Seats were hard felt very comfortable mid-way through the flight even though I have short legs. The reading lights kept coming on as we ""hit"" the light buttons located on the side of the arm- rest as we turned to relief body stiffness due to the discomfort of the seat. We sat 3 in a row and ordered the premium meal. I noticed mine was the biggest portion of 3. One of the portions was noticeably lesser probably about 85% of mine. There was a water point providing basic drinking water or you had the option to purchase bottled water. This is our first time flying with Scoot. Other than the uncomfortable seat overall it was OK for me and I will probably fly Scoot again. Looking forward to my return flight TZ5 on the Dreamliner. TZ5 Gold Coast - Singapore. Dreamliner seat was so much more comfortable. The soft and creative lighting makes it very pleasant. The windows shades also helps to create a soothing ambience. I like the sensor toilet flush wash basin tap and auto water drain - so much more convenient. It is sad that with such an updated and modern plane there was no drinking water point provided and basic drinking water had to be purchased. The reading light is now located on top of the arm rest and it keeps coming on as we rest our arms on the handle. Our pre-booked premium meal on this return trip was served without the Haagen Dazs ice cream. After we asked about the missing ice-cream we were given a bar of Toblerone chocolate and were informed that our meals come with Toblerone instead of Haagen Dazs. Naturally we were disappointed that we did not get what we have paid for. Will I travel with Scoot again? Yes so long as I do not need to buy basic drinking water on board and I get my meals purchased. If Scoot cannot deliver the meals purchased online they need to reconsider their model of not allowing outside food and drinks on board. There was a meal change after I booked my ticket and meal. I don't take beef. Luckily the change did not put beef on the table for me. Otherwise I will stay hungry despite having booked my meals.",,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,0.0
scoot,265269,2015-05-05,7,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,TZ2-TZ1 (SYD-SIN). My previous experience with their 777s were not so great especially the seats which were as hard as rock. However they have changed to the new 787 Dreamliner since then and I had a much better experience this time. Food was below average the portion still wasn't able to fill my hungry stomach. However the seats on the 787 had much better cushion and more legroom. I realized that you don't need an IFE if you are willing to pay US$30 to surf the Internet for the entire trip and a bit extra for power if you are running out of battery (though I didn't see anyone paying that in economy). The only reason IFE still exists is when you don't have access to Internet or your phone. If you don't really care about travel prestige not having hot towels and complimentary toiletries is fine willing to eat before you board and is trendy enough to substitute IFE for Internet access then you can get a really good deal out of this airline which consistently offers half the ticket price of legacy airlines over long-haul routes.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,5.0,yes,5.0

For some reason they revved up the left engine to full blast when the plane was parked and then throughout the flight that engine's rev level was continually and dramatically going up and down.

Because my husband is in a motorised wheelchair we arrived early and paid $5pp for an early check in to avoid any hassles. The staff member at check in was extremely helpful and changed our seating from 42 H & J to 23 B & C to be closer to the exit and toilets. On our arrival to the departure lounge we were approached by an employee with a manual wheelchair and he told my husband to get in it! We explained several times to him that the wheelchair was unsuitable and that a smaller chair was necessary to get him on the plane. We finally got on board the plane and they took the small wheelchair off the plane! I asked ""How will my husband get to the toilet if there's no wheelchair on board the plane?"". The fellow from the departure gate got into an argument with the stewardess and we understood that he was telling her that she and the other stewardesses would have to carry him to the toilet which was approximately 20ft (6metres) away! My husband told the fellow that he was too heavy for them to carry him! Eventually other male passengers agreed to carry him. A few minutes later the staff member demanded I disconnect the battery on the wheelchair! I told him several times that it was disconnected. By this time both my husband and I and were getting very upset. A few minutes later the departure lounge man came back and said ""Good news the wheelchair is on board because it's a dry cell battery"".

Be prepared and read the fine print as if you don't expect anything other than what they say you won't be disappointed! The flight was very cheap and absolutely no frills - no pillows blankets tea or coffee included. They are clear about this on their website any extras have to be paid for. Do not expect staff to be there to look after you although I found them all to be pleasant and polite. The food did not look to be worth buying we took sweets and small snacks for the kids and were not questioned on this although customers in front of me were asked to put their own food away. There was a free drinking water dispenser near the toilets on all the planes we travelled on but you had to go and get this yourself in your own bottle or cup. The seats were reasonable (except for the dreadful position of the call button). They like to board the planes really early so be prepared for that. We left on time each flight with one major upset with one flight where 2 hours from Singapore to Taipei we had to turn back to Singapore due to a medical issue with a passenger on board. I was surprised we did not even get a free cup of tea after what was ultimately a 5 hour delay - beyond their control admittedly but some recognition of the inconvenience would have been appropriate. Another delay due to weather when leaving Taipei was affecting all aircraft so once again frustrating but not their fault. No problems with baggage at all and although a very slow check in at Gold Coast Changi and Taoyuan check ins were a breeze. Did saving around $4000 in fares for a family of 5 make up for the inconveniences of the flight? Absolutely!

It appears however that I may well have been very lucky. The value for money is excellent but if you can afford it then certainly fly with a full service carrier. Once you pay Scoot for all the add ons the price difference is not really that great. I myself have booked to fly with them again but if I had the money I would not.

Catering was very disappointing. We pre-ordered wraps for lunch and these came with a drink. Wraps were as tasty as cardboard and drink was choice of coke or green jasmine tea in a can. We did not want either drink and asked if we could have water replacement. Completely surprising answer was that this was not possible with pre- ordered meals.

My friends had previously travelled on this flight and recommended I purchase the extra ""Yellow"" Stretch seats from Rows 21-25. Definitely do this! It cost me $66 extra but was it worth it! I'm close to 6 foot tall so the extra legroom was worth it alone. Food wise I played it safe and ordered the Ham/Cheese croissant and that was fine. I agree that a can of coke and small pringles is not the best ""health"" option but I bought my own food on board and there was no problem with that. Take an empty water bottle to refill. Don't try and take the bottled water through Gold Coast Customs - no go so you'll have to stand there and scull it! Scoot staff were fine and efficient. I can relate to the call button being ""dinged"" continuously due to the major design flaw of where the button is located on the armrest. All up I paid $745 back in January for this airfare and I am happy to do it again - but only in the yellow seats! The layout is 3-4-3 in economy and there were so mighty ""squashed"" people in those seats so invest the extra $70 (and hope that no one has the middle seat!). I agree with other reviewers that this section (Rows 21-25) is child-free and feels like your own little section.

Being a budget-type airline we had no high expectations and were satisfied with both journeys: Sydney to Singapore and Singapore to Sydney. On our forward journey we had chosen the economy blue seats 38A and 38B - and we had a passenger sitting near us on 38C. Found it very cramped. Decided to upgrade for the return journey to the yellow seats and must say that the extra room was well worth the extra payment. I would travel again with Scoot – next time booking the super economy (yellow) seats. With such low air fares you get what you pay for so we can't whinge about being offered coca cola and pringles as a snack! The meal on the return journey (beef wrap) was a huge improvement on the forward journey which was some sort of very ordinary rice concoction. The staff at every step of the way - from when we checked in until we landed were very efficient and courteous. In recommending this airline I would suggest that potential passengers do a bit of homework beforehand and choose a seat that maximises their comfort. The small cabin directly behind business class (rows 21 to 23) are excellent as it is a small cabin which has been declared ""child and baby free"" - so no screaming babies directly nearby.

We aren't exactly the youngest passengers on flights (60's) so the blue seats get a bit (lot) cramped after takeoff plus an hour. This time we splurged and got yellow seats in the back of the plane. Also ordered a meal. Everything worked well and the meals were exactly what is/are required on an 8 hour flight. The small extra cost for the seats was well spent as we were in a bracket of two (window and aisle) and it was only the two of us to sprawl across each other. The cabin crew was/were really good. Spoke good English and didn't seem to be troubled by the usual few fools that adorn every flight! I'd certainly fly Scoot again. Next time to Hong Kong. If I can get a decent Gold Coast to Hong Kong connection. Check-in at the Gold Coast was fast and efficient. Same at Changi. Tip. Take your own Tablet device loaded with your fave TV or Movies. Yep. The battery will expire before the flight lands but by then you will be ready for a few hours of sleep. Also take an empty 500/600ml water bottle on board.

Then for some unknown reason it stopped in Perth before continuing to Sydney. Finally it landed in Sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. I missed my onward connections to Canberra.

Overall a good product check in very efficient through dedicated Biz desk young man was very friendly and professional he also mentioned we could board the plane as soon as boarding begins. Unfortunately no option to purchase Business Lounge Access at Perth. Boarding was efficient with a call to all Scoot biz to board at the start excellent much improved on last time. Boarded the cabin to realise there were only 4 people of the 32 seat occupied in the Biz section as always we were greeted warmly when boarding the plane. Drink orders were taken before take off and we were allowed any drink on their menu something not offered on our previous trip so improving all the time opted for Singapore slings we were told we would get these after take off. As with Biz we were provided with a small sealed cup of water like you get in economy take off was earlier than expected which I was impressed with. It was about 30 minutes after we took off when we were provided with our pre ordered meal not bad with small can of pringles and a bottle of pre mixed Singapore sling with a cup of ice overall good for budget maybe disappointing for any other service. Once again we were unable to use the entertainment system this time using a tablet instead of a laptop but once again no luck. We rarely saw the cabin staff and they did not come out and give us the code to access the entertainment. Scoot need to look at this as I don't think I'm the only one to have this issue. My favourite part of the experience is the seat its like premium economy comfortable with 38 inch leg room and 20inch width great for a 5 hour flight.

If you want a budget airline with no frills substandard food at premium prices that charges you every time you blink then this airline is for you. I can understand extra for food drinks (even water) entertainment but to charge you for checking in early is a pathetic money grabbing option. Only $5 but no mention of fee at early check-in sign at airport after queuing in line for 20 minutes and many complaints from other passengers a staff member came from behind the counter to tell you of the charge when you are two passengers from the counter and by the time we got to the counter we were only 5 minutes early.

(Probably just an old aircraft. The seats looked old and dirty but overall very spacious and comfortable. The cabin seemed warm and stuffy throughout the flight though). Safety and budget transportation was definitely the main focus of the airline. In safety aspects the crew did their seatbelt checks after the turbulence announcement and constantly doing toilet-checks and house-keeping often. Announcements by the crew could be improved in terms of clarity audibility and tone of voice. I did not try the inflight entertainment and purchase any meals. But the menu of the inflight meals and the list of inflight entertainment seemed interesting and a bit on the steep side.

Although they announce that food purchased from outside is not allowed to be consumed many people have a bite and no one says anything - I would recommend this option over purchasing the inflight food especially as many people have said that it is not good. We watched our own movies on our iPad so entertainment wasn't an issue either. Safety measures were taken very seriously and the cabin crew were responsive when they were called for. I would definitely recommend this airline it does what it says on the tin and at a very decent price.

The sorting out of pre-booked meals is stupid.

A bad decision was to opt for payment of excess baggage (over 15kg) at the airport which cost $264. Boarding was chaotic the plane eventually departing 35 minutes late. My wife ordered a meal that would not be fit for a dog's consumption mine being a concoction which was barely edible. Onboard in the equivalent of premium economy the seats were sufficiently comfortable for a 5 hour flight but no more. There would appear to be very little the cabin crew knew of basics that is so superbly demonstrated by its parent company. While in Singapore I tried to pay for baggage through the website and only with the assistance of a family member was this achieved after 3 days of trying. The return flight was about 40% capacity and the service was still below average. Duty free shopping was not on a trolley but was available at the rear galley of the plane (no announcement to this effect). I did like the list of passenger seat numbers showing who had ordered food on line - a scrappy piece of cardboard stuck to one of the cupboards.

scoot,265322,2014-01-02,5,Australia,,Scoot customer review,PER-SIN-PER just after Christmas as the fares were incredibly cheap (less than $850 for three people to SIN and back). Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot.

When boarding they asked people at the back of the plane to board first not sure what seat numbers this included. Got on board and had a stretch seat plenty of leg room which was great news being over 6 foot. Generally the seats are more comfortable than any budget airline I have travelled did notice the 3-4-3 is much tighter than the 3-3-3 with Singapore Airlines on the same plane but was ok. Food and tablet arrived quickly once we took off and I was seated very close to back of plane. Big issue was that they collected tablet an hour before we landed I managed to watch one movie and half of another. Even with watching tablet as soon as I received and whilst eating. Food was tasty and very spicy with a can of coke and a small pack if Pringles this was a pre paid meal.

Had to remind check in that we had business lounge and asked for process and direction also had to ask for tag for hand luggage as given on previous trip. Lounge which cost extra was operated by SATS comfortable and better than Qantas lounge we used recently. Good food and drink choice massage chair and internet. No loungers or flat chairs. Boarded plane easily not sure if announcer asked Scoot Biz to board but we got on with no issues. Comfort in seats good I would rate cabin and seats as comparable with premium economy as I've travelled business and generally seats are much wider. Service was good with getting water at start of flight and meal promptly after take off. Would be good to get another drink later in flight to make it more biz style. My big issue was with taking my own laptop on and not getting it to work I downloaded at home before going but could not get it working. My advice hire a tablet for $20 or take your own entertainment. It's a shame as this was the only negative of the experience. Flights all good on timings.

The interior was clean and had a fresh look. Seats are not too uncomfortable with good legroom. However the light and call attendant buttons were too easily triggered by passengers shifting about in their seats. Pleasantly surprised that the cabin staff regularly ensure that the toilets are cleaned and freshened. They seem to put a lot of effort into it which I greatly appreciate as an almost full load both ways result in heavy toilet usage.

Booking system is great and very flexible. You can pick and choose say Business one leg and economy return. Our SYD-SIN flight was cancelled and Scoot automatically re-booked us 1 day earlier. This didn't suit us so agreed to change at no extra cost and also changed the next leg returning to BKK bought on a separate booking. Also impressive from an LCC. Flew Business class from BKK to SIN return because the marginal extra costs wasn't that much more. Good seat pitch space. Not too full. Leather seats a little hard but OK. Food ordered was changed but no big deal on short flight. Staff were never rude but they were not overly friendly which was a surprise given their supposed ""Scootitude"" (attitude). Bought Business for the late night overnight SIN to SYD because we wanted space to sleep and was glad. Very empty with only 8 passengers so we all shuffled around and had a bench each. Except that 2 of the 3 middle row arm rests would not lift up so it wasn't really a bed. Worse luck! On this leg the staff were very attentive and around. On the daylight return SYD to SIN we flew the extra space yellow seats in the child free front economy cabin. This was very good and highly recommended. Great amount of space and worth the slight extra premium charge. Had an excellent meal on this leg with free rum and coke. Again not much attention from the staff to be honest but remember this is LCC. Only one minor point was that when we checked in for one leg we wanted to upgrade to buy the business lounge service in SIN and were told that it was too late. Rules are rules but there was at least 2 hours to go before the flight and that seemed petty to me frankly. I had been hoping to use a tablet for the entertainment but the system doesn't support a tablet. Pity but no big deal. Lastly all 4 flights were extremely punctual. I was surprised.

Then they changed my meal from a hot meal to sandwiches which I already paid for as an option. Then they lost my baggage even though I paid extra so that they would specifically look after my baggage. Also the seats are a nightmare with no headrest and are very cramped.

This is our second time travelling with Scoot and both times we were quite happy with the airline. It is a budget airline and it delivers exactly what it promises. The seats are by far the most comfortable of all budget airlines that we have used and the food quite decent and not exorbitant. I had not pre-booked a meal reading reviews that food is bad but when we ordered on board we found it quite good. One tip would be to order sandwiches or food that does not need to be heated. The transit at Taipei was smooth and we reached Narita on the dot. Only reason I have not given it full marks is that we had pre-booked iPad for my daughter and the stewardess first said they had none that were working. When I insisted on the fact that we had already booked and they should refund our money she promptly brought the iPad to us. But it was a small point in an overall good journey.

Now the negatives: the seats were uncomfortable the legroom was poor (I'm 6 ft 6 so an exit row seat in economy would have been better) the movie selection was dreadful the FAs were inexperienced and the 2.10 am departure time from Singapore to Sydney is a killer.

Yellow seating was great for 6 foot tall family members. We did not use the inflight entertainment as we had good books and ipad for music and we did not eat their food. They hit you 4 dollars for a small bottle of water so bringing your own empty one is a good idea. You are not meant to bring your own food aboard but it seems many do and have no issues from staff. Booking online was fine once I took the time to figure out all the options. We used the Scoot lounge in Singapore and will do this again too. Shower good food wine spirits fruit coffee internet massage chairs all good. We were on time out bound and 30 min late on our return but this was fully explained by the pilot as because of air traffic control. It could have happened to any airline.

Less than 12 hours before my flight I realized that my seat allocation had gone. Not only the business class upgrade but also the yellow coloured seat. If I want to return to my original seat I have to pay again 14 Singapore dollars which I am not happy to do but no choice. What surprises me is that Scoot can give yellow coloured seat number 52 for free but not my original seat number 23. It just does not make sense to me. First I lost my seat allocation and upgrade to business class now Scoot asked me for SGD 14 at the last minute. I won't be flying Scoot again.

The only (small) problem was the crew kept bumping into me in the middle of the night when walking down the aisle during service but I wasn't too disturbed. Immigration in OOL is really strict!

Check-in very crowded slow and understaffed. Avoided the crowd by going to the ScootBiz counter and upgrading but could only upgrade to Singapore. I had to upgrade Singapore- Taipei at Changi. ScootBiz is not luxurious. Seat is a little wider and with a power outlet. Metal foot rest is uncomfortable. Meal was a sandwich and a small can of Pringles plus a drink. Flight crew were young energetic all very nice and well groomed. The pilot and crews English pronunciation were mostly incomprehensible. Entertainment package - you login using a special PIN. There are no instructions on how to set up your computer. No one from Scoot will help you. Upon arrival in Singapore I went to the Transfer counter in Lounge E Terminal 2 to get my new boarding pass.

At Changi Airport I had gone to the Widevine Media Optimizer website and downloaded the entertainment browser add-on after which it installed without a problem.

Check-in was chaotic with the supposedly dedicated business class line checking in a large group of economy class passengers. When I approached I was told to wait at the end of that line even though I was a business class passenger. No lounge access at Sydney airport. The main problem was onboard. Their business class seats were inferior to several major carrier's economy seats. Hardly enough legroom and the person behind was constantly bumping the back of my seat. Recline on the seats was minimal as to be unnoticeable. No inflight entertainment and all that was on offer was a miserable tablet pre-loaded with 3 movies which was not free not even for business class passengers.

A 7-8 hr flight is not hard work so we chose the Fly-Bag option and ate before we flew on both sectors. We paid to select extra legroom seats and travelled the equivalent of premium economy seat pitch and were very comfortable. Flights ran on time - and arrived ahead of schedule in both directions. Staff courteous and attentive. They cleaned the toilets at least 3 times an hour - more frequently than on any other plane Ive been on. I would not hesitate to recommend or fly them again.

There is nothing flash about this airline but the room between rows was acceptable! The staff were efficient and the food was OK. We bought ""FlyBagEat"" however you have to add on the cost of a seat to this fare how are you going to fly without a seat? The ""convenience fee"" of a $10 was added (apparently for credit card)! All in all we had no complaints about the trip over. We also booked a trip back but as this leaves at 2.10am we decided to buy a super seat for about an extra $40 each. This turned out to be worth every cent - we booked a seat in aisle 21 just behind business class and had the bulkhead in front. My husband could stretch his legs and we didn't have anyone in front so didn't have to worry about anyone wanting to recline their seat. On the way back we arrived at 5pm at Changi with luggage for a flight leaving at 2am. It cost us $5 each for the early check-in and you have to pay in cash. One good value deal was access to the SATS lounge for $S39 each. This allows you to use the lounge for 4 hours (consecutive use). This was a wonderful oasis for us. Also you get priority boarding which is a real asset at 2am in the morning! I thought the breakfast was revolting (fried mushrooms a sausage of sorts a triangle of some egg dish (omelette perhaps) and a soggy hash brown.

I should mention that between the four of us we did only have 3 small backpacks which were less then 7kg in weight and we checked them in as cabin luggage. On the way home we did arrive at both Bangkok and Singapore airports quite early (around 3.5 hours) due to an early flight from Koh Samui and an overnight in Singapore. So we were the first ones to check in. this worked in our favour as we were for some reason automatically upgraded to the yellow seats on both sectors. they are definitely more comfy and have more leg room then the blue seats. However to be honest we are not big people (average height average build) so the blue seats were fine for us anyway if you were taller or bigger in size it may be more uncomfortable I guess. Overall we had a great experience with Scoot. The price was incredibly cheap at just over $1400 for four of us.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5.0,yes,0.0

Allowing 15kgs cabin baggage is a grave mistake as most passengers on this flight brought in at least 2 pieces of baggage each making the clearance extra slow at the screening area. Those who board plane later had no space left for their baggage. Aircrew was not well trained the worst I've encountered in a budget airline.

When we got to the airport our assistance had not been assigned. We waited until the queues had vanished from check-in and the counter staff simply ignored us and went on with their other duties. t is impossible to get through to their call centre - they seem to be perpetually experiencing a high volume of calls never mind the time.

Flight departed on time which was a relief after seeing other reviews. Cabin attendants were far from 'fun vibrant' crew members mentioned in all the airline PR. More like exhausted/frustrated with their job. One snapped at a women when she asked to clarify the pre-ordered sandwich she had just been given. All in all an ok flight.

Seats were wide enough and recline was ok for a sleep with very good head rests the only complaint is there is no space between armrests so it's just like in economy where there isn't enough room for your arm and the person next to yours. Only 1 drink and meal included but the beers were reasonably priced at $4 AU but water was expensive at $3AU. Flight was on time and check in a breeze through the dedicated Biz counter.

I pre-paid for meals but wouldn't do so again. In future I would bring my own food. I also pre-paid for ""Scoot-thru."" - the Scoot transfer facility in Singapore for Scoot-Scoot or Tiger passengers. The advantage of doing this is that it provides a similar connection facility to that of just about any legacy carrier. Not pre- paying this fee means that if I had missed the connecting flight I would have had to pay (according to Scoot terms and conditions) a re-booking fare and the fare differential for the next available flight even if the problem was with Scoot.

Boarding was slow but smooth. The taxi and takeoff roll were done professionally. Food was served 1.5hrs after takeoff had lasagne which was not too bad its better to pre-order online to prevent long waiting times. For the rest of the flight I slept. Outbound flight ended well with a smooth landing but the immigration at Gold Coast wasn't very fast at all. OOL-SIN a long line at check in followed by another long line at immigration and boarding once on board managed to rest until takeoff. Food served 1.5hrs into the flight and had the lasagne meal which includes pepsi and fruit chips. Landing was fairly smooth.

scoot,265337,2012-08-28,10,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Flew Scoot for the first time and had a very enjoyable experience. The seats are actually very comfortable and already well reclined in its up-right state. I didn't feel the need to recline my seat throughout my SIN- SYD trip. There was sufficient legroom and space under the seats to stretch your legs and ample overhead storage space. I didn't miss the entertainment as I brought my own tablet as had most people. That said onboard rental of a fully loaded iPad at $22 seems reasonable to me. While I didn't try all food on offer I did load up on snacks and I like the flexibility of being able to purchase what I wanted when I wanted. The one issue I have is the positioning of the call button on the armrest that often gets accidentally depressed whenever you shift positions in your seat. I'm not a large person but I seemed to set off the pinging each time I shifted. The downside of course is that the stewards/stewardesses may not be as responsive when you actually want to call them.

I had arrived at the check-in counter at around 7:53AM and was concerned about the one-hour boarding deadline. The counter lady was busy assisting another individual, and my wife and I were the last in line to be checked-in. The lady finished the other individual around 7:58AM and as I was heading to speak with her, she said I could not board because the hour deadline had passed. As you can imagine, I was livid and told her that it wasn't my fault she took so long to assist the passenger before me. I said it was not my fault as I had arrived at the line before 7:55AM. We had several back and forth encounters as you can imagine I am out several hundred dollars and she told me I had to book another flight since there were no more ZIPAIR flights leaving Narita that day. She was not helpful at all as I asked how to inquire for a refund. She said you'll get the taxes back. I then asked how do I do that? She said to contact customer service. I asked how do I do it? She said there's no phone number, you'll need to email them. I literally had to ask her questions by piecemeal.

Back to the initial complaint, on flight ZG026 to San Francisco on 9/18/23. I got to my seat and I over heard the flight attendants that did not wear name badges, speaking in Japanese about of have to make sure the fat lady has a seat belt extender. This the behavior you allow for your company. Then one comes up to me and pulls the seat belt and extends it then says you need an extender. Not ask but stated that I needed one. Still remaining calm I told her I already have one of my own and proceed to click it to get her smoothly. She leaves and talk with the previous attendant that was talking bad about me and comes back saying it’s not safe for me to use my own seatbelt extender belt. Then shoves theirs in my hand and says be sure to give this back at the end of flight and stayed until I removed mine and connected theirs to the seat belt. The attendant walks off says something else that I could not fully hear but definitely heard I’m going to mark her seat down so she doesn’t steals it to the previous attendant they both laugh. I proceeded to state I really don’t need this extension belt and you two are making me uncomfortable and we haven’t even taken off. They lie and says it’s policy and then walk off. Fast forward to 2/3 of the flight nearly ending the same attendant wakes me out of my sleep to tell me don’t forget to leave the extension belt in the seat when I leave. I calmly say ok even though I am boiling because of the assumption of assuming that I’m going to steal a extension belt extender, then when we land and the seatbelt light is off. I took off the seat belt and detached everything and left in the seat. The same harassing attendant comes up to me and demands I give her the seatbelt extender. I reach behind me and get it for her and said I thought you wanted me to leave it in the seat but please do take note that you have it back in your hands. Because I am not a thief and do not appreciate being harassed like one. I wish they had name plates so I can post it in this review.

For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty.

We Googled Zipair to make sure it was a real airline. The moment we checked in we realized this airline is real and it's an amazing deal. The customer service reps at check in asked if we'd been to Japan before and what we were excited about doing while quickly and efficiently checking us in. It was a great start but were concerned about seat comfort and inflight Wifi. As we entered the plane we realized seat comfort was not an issue. The seats were a clean, comfortable leather and had more leg space than most American carriers. Once we got in the air the Wifi connected quickly so we could access email and order food. It's not strong enough to download movies or tv shows so do that before you board. Food options are limited, they run out quick if you don't preorder. I suggest eat early or bring your own food. Beverages were comparably priced with other airlines and it didn't seem to run out of any drinks. The inflight staff was very attentive and kept trash out of the aisles and seat backs the entire flight. Our return trip from Tokyo to San Francisco was exactly the same.

They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing.

Air Asia changed the flight schedule by 5 hours and this was not compatible with my holidays. So I asked for a refund on Dec 2. On Dec 16, I went through the long and inefficient talk with robot AVA until I get in the queue for a human agent with n°90. After an hour, I got an answer: your refund will be done in 2 days. On Dec 20, after playing again with AVA for half an hour, I was granted to the queue with number 144. And after 2 questions, the chat was terminated by the agent or ? and I still not get and answer. But every time the claim case was solved. I guess this is a great satisfaction for Air Asia to close claims, without answering their customer. In fact AVA was better than the agent, but both are inefficient. So I gave up with AVA, and called the phone voicemail service for Air Asia Thailand. I explained my case and  after 24 hours still waiting for a call back when it should have been done in 24 hours. But for urgent case I can contact AVA: joke. Form this experience, I notice that the customer service at Air Asia is non-existent, but also when you consider the price of the ticket (must check everything: seat, luggage, food), Air Asia is no more advantageous compare to a normal airlines like Malaysia Airlines or Thai. And for a small difference of the fare you can talk to a real agent instead of a stupid robot and incompetent agents.

Since I couldn’t get any clarity, I decided to go down to the airport counter and asked some questions to the ground staff at the AirAsia counter.  She checked and confirmed the refund request was actually for both depart and return tickets, something that is not made clear in the bot chat. The ground staff could not void my refund request as this has to be done by AirAsia and not the airport staff. I had thought that the refund was only going to be for my return ticket but I had lost both tickets. Because of this, they couldn’t guarantee that I will still have my name in the booking system on my departure date. The ground staff said there’s nothing that can be done on their side as they have no way to reach AirAsia. Basically, I need to book another ticket which is way more expensive now that I have so little time left before my flight. So before you book your tickets think twice.

As it was a 40min flight and a budget airline, there was not much the cabin crew had to do but they were warm and friendly. One interesting perk about this flight was the ability to stream the inflight entertainment into my own device without needing to download a seperate app; all I had to do was to connect to the inflight WiFi which was enabled even on this short hop and I found it very unique, setting aside AirAsia from other budget carriers, and the selection was quite generous too, with some movies, documentaries and even games.

Other than Low-cost fare, Air Asia well known with flight delay, flight rescheduled, poor customer service. It happens regularly that the flight rescheduled on every single flight.

I'm not the first one and I believe will not be the last one. How AA Customers support system fooling customer around? It must be a platform to train your patience. AA customer support system has 4 ways to contact Air Asia which are Live chat (24/7), call centre, Twitter(24/7) and e-form. I have tried 4 of them: Live chat (24/7): it has been removed - 26 Dec 2018 URL No Longer Exists You have to wait for average 1 hour on live chat queue to say hi to a live chat staff. If you miss the screen when the conversation started, you will kick out from the chatroom by livechat staff, when you check back the screen, it showed ""thank you for contacted live chat"". You have to wait for another one hour. Live chat staff could simply end your conversation without your notice, so even your question not yet finish,you will be kicked out by the staff again. Call centre: I have called to call centre from Malaysia at RM2 per minute! I wanted to buy/add-on/upgrade my baggage to 25kg (3 days before my flight), but it is no longer available on ""modify"" at the airasia homepage. The only way is you have to call them (yes waste time + money), otherwise it would me RM45/kg (not sure they increase the price or not) at the check-in counter. waiting time: generally 10 minutes. Twitter (24/7) the so-called ""24/7"" Twitter service is totally a lie. You can tweet them 24/7, but they will only reply to you immediately, most of the time a few hours or few days. (tweet them for 5 months due to my lost bag case). When the staff is free they will tell you Please wait for the investigation or there's not much they can do, please contact live chat/call/e-form. Live chat, twitter and call centre will push all the responsibility to e-form. Ask you to contact e form. E-form has annoyed and wasted my time the most. It took few days/about 1 month to reply to you, they could just reply sorry that they have done their best and simply closed the case straight after. I've created the same case for 3 times because the staff closed my case without solving my problem, but it is written in the email that my case has been solved, or you didn't reply the email within 7 days. Here comes the tactic: at first you can still contact the AA staffs, but after 3-4 emails, suddenly your reply cannot reach to the AA support team and this will end up case closed because the system shows that you didnt reply to the AA email. When you reply, a no reply email message will tell you that your case has closed, if you need any assistant, please send an e form again! I strongly advise you be aware when you book the AA ticket. The price is really attractive, but please make sure you add on all the bag, meal etc. For the locals, I suggest you check also the price from Malaysia Airlines, Fireflyz and Malindo.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur,Singapore,,March 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,1.0

I have no idea whether it is the best way of serving on board but I see many flight attendants who are serving passengers more actively. They refused my Chinese money once I ordered a can of coke. I have given them 14RMB, the flight attendant returned me with 2RMB and said it is too old. As a passenger I can't the control or reject the legal money given to me from a supermarket, can I?

We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldn’t a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for “express handling”. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1 ½ hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority – everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal.

What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money.

The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all.

At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries.

Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead. Overall, i recommend Air Asia whenever you're looking for basic service to get you where you have to go quickly and cheaply.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN,CGK,,December 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,yes,

When we arrived at the Gold Coast, the outside air temperature was 16 degrees - that felt warm. Moreover the lights were left on until very late (approx. 2.5 hrs after take off) and turned on very early (approx. 3 hrs before landing). We had very little time for sleeping. In conclusion, it was the most uncomfortable flight we have traveled on. On the return trip, we were notified via email around 3.40 am that the flight was about 3 hour delayed, however we left home at 5am and had not checked our email so we were not aware of the delay. When we arrived at the airport we tried to ask staff to issue us a Boarding pass for the next available connecting flight to Bangkok from KL as we knew we would miss our originally booked flight. However we were told they could not do that but she assured us that Air Asia staff in KL would be able to get us a flight to Bangkok that evening. When we arrived at KL we (and other passengers who missed their connecting flights) were made to wait at the transit desk for around 40 mins before we were notified that all of us had to stay overnight in KL and fly the next day.

So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters.

We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation.

I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations.

airasia,239577,2014-12-10,2,United States,,AirAsia customer review,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1.0
airasia,239574,2014-12-10,3,United Kingdom,,AirAsia customer review,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.,,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,1.0

The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats.

When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security).

I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them.

I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard.

Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable.

So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport.

Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage.

As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor.

Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor.

Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one.

I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown.

Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes.

Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience.

I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour.

airasia,239439,2012-07-02,2,Vietnam,,AirAsia customer review,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,3.0,no,0.0

I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that.

The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this.

I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure.

There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG.

Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe!

Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer.

The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,

And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around.

I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane.

The check in counter had 5 lanes open, and about 15 groups ahead of us. We did the online check in, and used the kiosk to print our bag tags. Did this save us any time? No.  We had to wait in the check in line for over an hour waiting on other passengers to adjust their bags to avoid paying extra baggage fees - if it was one group I would understand, but it was every single one of them, and the gate agents did nothing about this. Instead they played on facebook. When it is finally our turn the gate agent says we did the bag tags wrong and re does them the same way I did. He sends the first 2 bags to be loaded and continues to the next 2 bags. On the second 2 bags he puts a transfer ticket on them without telling us that he forgot to on the first 2 bags. We noticed it but he didn't think we did. After going thru security, we talked about it and came to the conclusion that we needed to talk to someone. We couldn't afford for these bags to be delayed so we asked the security agent who we should talk to. He directs us to go back thru security and talk to the supervisor. We asked 2 people for a manager, they refused to get a manager and offered to help themselves. When we expressed our concern they offered to check our bags and they went to the sorting area and came back stating that our bags have already been sealed and cannot be checked. We then went to a security manager to express our concern and we were able to finally talk to the desk manage. He told us he could pull the bags to check, but I'd he did, they will probably not make the flight.  We arrive to Manila and departed the plane and took a bus to terminal 3. We noticed that many passengers were not getting off the plane so we asked a stewardess if this bus was for transfers and she said yes, so we proceeded. We arrived on the bus in terminal 3 at the baggage claim and needed to be at terminal 4. Confused and short on time to catch our connecting flight we found the transfer desk after having to ask for directions. The agent at the counter didn't look up from her phone until we started filming and threatening to put the video on social media. Only then did she show us where the transfer bus was. We get to another agent at the bus transfer depot and he informed us that the bus had just departed and it would be at least 30 minutes till the next one, and by then we would miss our boarding cut off.

Any flight I took with this airline started and ended in a chaos. People dragging way too much luggage into the cabin, people seemingly clueless where their seat is while blocking the aisle and frustrating the boarding process. The crew is helpless, but tries to keep cool. While preparing the cabin for departure several people start using the toilets meaning that during taxiing people are in the aisles. The flights are uneventful, although the last landing at MNL was quite rough. All in all not bad for the price paid, but an experience.

They cancelled that and gave us a halt at Philippines for 18 hours. - Initially when we asked at our check in counter in Bali about this they said, sorry we cannot do anything as Cebu pacific doesn’t have any office or personal there. - There was no easy way to get in touch with them that, we even tried the Facebook messenger which was completely managed by the bot and not helpful at all. - Once we arrived at the Philippines airport, the staff of Cebu pacific had made us wait at the transfer desk for almost 1.5 hours and then they just left to hide from the other passengers in distress. - As per the immigration rules many passengers couldn’t exit and were stuck in the airport for 18 hours. - They tried offering us compensation after repeated complaining from our end, After making us wait for 2 hours additional We could see it was a ruse as they offered us 3 hotels. Out of which two of them were 2 star hotel and one of them was a 2.5 star and extremely far from the airport. Crisis management was extremely weak, we were given statements such as “you took the flight from Bali to Philippines , that means you accepted our conditions” , “You can take your own hotel” , “You can post whatever you like” etc. in short, they did not care about the passengers concerns, wellbeing or comfort they just wanted to do escape from the situation.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bali,Dubai,Manila,January 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,

My connecting flight, which was supposed to depart at 04.55, was delayed until 10.10 am (without explanation). The airline bought one free McDonald's meal for every customer, but in my opinion, that did not make up for a 5 hour delay. 2. When I made my booking, it was made clear that there would be no food available on the flight. However, once on the flight, I noticed that other passengers had been able to pre-book meals. It would have been nice if this option were available to me to - would have saved me from having to buy food at ridiculous prices in Dubai airport. 3. I understand that this is a budget airline, but the low cost is not worth the discomfort. The seats are tiny and do not recline. There is no inflight entertainment. This flight was almost 10 hours long and it was incredibly uncomfortable. The restrooms were dirty and smelled bad. 4. When we landed in Manila, the captain announced that because of the red thunder, there would be a slight delay in de-boarding. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the terminal we were supposed to use for de-boarding was occupied by another airline because of the disruption of the thunderstorm. He said we would wait for 10-15 minutes. This went on for two hours, with him periodically announcing that it would only be another 10-15 minutes. After the 6 hour delay and almost 10 hour flight, this pushed me past my breaking point. The pilot said it was beyond their control.

If the handcarry is too heavy, there will be an opportunity to move stuff to the check in. The lady at the counter didn’t do so, so we assumed that everything was ok. Once we got to immigration, the officer started checking the weight of our luggage. I’ve never seen an immigration officer check the weight for airlines because each airline have different standards. This was already sketchy to us because it felt like a scam. This didn’t give anyone an opportunity to rearrange the luggage to suit the required weight and you would have no other choice BUT to pay for the extra weight. 2nd JPN-MNL we still haven’t flown but I’m just really disappointed with Cebu Pacific so I’m writing this. Aside from the flight being delayed for an expected 4 hours and more, we had to pay 2900 yen for our check in luggage. Apparently we only paid check in luggage for one way (MNL-JPN) and we didn’t do so the other way. But when I did the online check in, I clearly saw that we had one check in baggage. The lady said that she can’t find it in the system and that we would have to take it up in the Philippines. We tried to explain that this was an online booking and if she can’t find it in the system. Most likely they won’t be able to find it in their system too. Assuming that they run the same system. So we paid and the lady said we should just try to get reimbursed. We left the counter and my mom realized that we didnt get a receipt. We went back to get it because they didn’t accept any forms of card and only accepted cash.

No service at all times. At the Check-In staff always well trained to seek for additional sales. Like when you are in your limits of baggage you can see the disappointment in their eyes that no money can be taken from you! Delays are not being announced. My travel partner was not able to make the flight. All reservations from my side were done through my credit card accounts and I booked everything through their website! As we had one booking, I needed to call 5J as I was not able to split the booking myself through their website. Calling them takes quite a while time, getting hold of them takes time. The agent I spoke to was friendly, providing me options within my case. As a rebooking for my travel companion was out of question listening to their options in our case, he decided to fly a different carrier! I was given the option that I could not refund the ticket although the ticket was refundable, instead I would be given a travel fund for 90 days! I was OK with that option cause I knew I would be flying again sooner. I asked the agent to split our booking and I was advised all further processes you can do through our website as you will be able now to change/rebook/cancel yourself online. I asked also the Travel Fund will be processed through my option to cancel and I was confirmed. Trusting the fact that I could manage all on my own, I did cancel the booking one day after in the knowing I will have a travel fund. What I was not told that the travel fund will now be only claimable under the surname of the booking carried in the booking! Which was now my travel companion and not mine. I paid all tickets and I did pay above 10.000PHP for this one way flight from Bohol to Manila. I felt sure and assured through my call that I can cancel it through the website and not needing to place a call again as waiting time and costs to save! So I cancelled all through the website! Doing this with the secure feeling of eveything I wanted to purchase a new ticket for myself. After being back in Europe I called 5J at least more than 30 minutes to find out that I will not be able to collect my travel fund on my name and to being told that I did agree to the conditions given as it clearly states online. I explained the call center agent the situation and she forwarded my case to an escallation team, and I was told I could call back within 24-48 hrs to find out of further results. I called back 27 hrs after, no updates spending 20 mins to find out, I callled 57 hrs after after spending 40 mins with waiting on hold in line due to busy agents noone available. I decided to contact 5J through Social Media - answer after 10 hrs NO UPDATE. After additional 2 hrs I was contacted by 5J via phone. My request was declined. Clearly 5J does not really care who pays the tickets of its passengers - their policies are clearly made to keep funds pending and to make it difficult for someone to claim their money! 5J does not care about their passengers, they just care about your money. 3300 PHP will be a gift to them as they stick to their policy not understanding the customers side.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tagbilaran,Manila,,January 2018,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,3.0,no,

In general, all my flights were a pleasant experience. Often times the Jakarta-Manila leg is on time. When it gets delayed, it's usually due to long boarding process (around 15-30 minutes) because passengers need to be moved by a shuttle bus from gate to the aircraft. Meanwhile, the Manila-Jakarta leg lately was always on time. It's worth noting though that both flight schedule are considered off-peak hours of the airports. Cabin crew service are so-so. Some were nice, welcoming, but also some were not. Though, I am usually not expecting too much from a low-cost airline. When it comes to food, so far, I've only tried their Beef Tapa and Chicken Tocino. Nothing special honestly, and in fact it is overpriced. The serving is too small for it's price tag. The only good thing is that they accept payments in multiple currencies: PHP, USD, and IDR. Lastly, their A320s look well maintained. In the inside the cabin looks clean, smells good, and is cold.

I concur from experience with much that has been written in complaints as warnings to prospective passengers, but the worst scam from Cebu Pacific, and most likely it is Company Policy, is their one of an “onward” or “return” ticket requirement. My partner and I have both experienced that demand from their check-in staff, yet from no other airline during our frequent travels. In one instance my partner's destination visa was clearly annotated “Return/onward ticket not required”, and we subsequently found that it was not possible to obtain a refund for the return ticket purchase demanded by check-in as a condition of boarding. I was told just several weeks ago that “return” ticketing (to where? country of departure or home country?) was a “requirement"" for my return to the Philippines, despite holding a 59 day visa as I have used regularly for 5 years, taking usually 4 flights every 2 months, almost exclusively with Cebu Pacific. On arrival at Manila I was granted entry, and no evidence of an outbound ticket was requested by the border staff. Both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bureau of Immigration suggest that this an ""airline requirement”, which means that everyone, every time they fly international routes with Cebu Pacific, may be scammed into purchasing a new ticket with no refund option, reschedule fees exceeding the value of a new booking, and only a smug reply from the Customer representative suggesting you “Put up and Shut Up”! My experience suggests that any further correspondence or discussion will be ignored. So if the check-in delays don’t steer you towards another airline; as untrained staff study the world’s immigration requirements, then check with their superior, before eventually accepting the next “Guest” from the queued backlog; maybe the very real likelihood of your ticket actually costing you twice as much as advertised, and reasonably expected, will find you seeking out an airline which cares just enough to complete your journey without further blackmail. I’m not willing to take that risk again, despite their cabin crew, aircraft, and timeliness being quite acceptable, as their admin staff and I-hate-to-call-them “managers” have finished them for me! I have seen many other passengers subjected to this same arrogant inconvenience and expense, our experience appears very common, but I’ve seen it only with Cebu Pacific check-in staff. Online booking hassles are a warning of things to come, both price changes and charge confirmation difficulties requiring calls to CP. When you finally are accepted at check-in there are pedantic baggage weight limits applied indiscriminately, apparent separation of baggage for customs scrutiny at the destination, last minute flight cancellations with no alternative offered, musical chairs boarding gates and unintelligible announcements - it’s an impressive list, and don’t think you’ll forget the hassles over a delicious in-flight meal, either!",,Business,Economy Class,Hong Kong,Cebu,Manila,September 2017,3.0,4.0,,1.0,,1.0,no,

On Cebu Pacific, things go ok until they don't, and when they don't go ok, they become disastrous very quickly! I and two business companions booked a flight to Macau for an important business meeting in China. Instead of trying to make connections on the same day of the meeting, we broke the trip up into two days. We chose one day to travel and rest up for the meeting on the next day. We had a 3:00 PM flight to Manila and a connecting flight to Macau at 7:30 PM that evening. We were at the airport in Cebu at 1:30PM. Our flight to Manila was delayed 3 hours and when they finally told us we would be leaving we asked for help because there was no way we would be able to make our connection. The ground staff helped us by checking us in for the Macau flight and giving us our boarding passes so we could proceed quickly to the departure gate once we arrived in Manila. Then they told us they would notify Manila that were delayed and coming! However, when we got to Manila, we missed the connection! Turned out that no one in Cebu informed the gate personnel at the Macau flight gate that we were coming. The ensuing ""remedy"" made us extremely late for our China meeting, cost of over $1000 in extra expenses we should never have had, and aged us all by at least 10 years. We expected Cebu Pacific to transfer us to another carrier so that we could get over to Macau, but it turns out that Cebu Pacific does not have any relationships of that sort with other airlines. The extent of the ground staff's attempt to find us a flight was limited to scanning airline websites looking for possible flights for us. In the end we had no choice but to stay with Cebu Pacific and let them get us to Hong Kong (not Macau) the next morning. Several days after arriving home I filed a complaint and the result was an email messages saying how sorry everyone was for all the delays and hassles, but that an investigation concluded that personnel followed acceptable procedures in handling our situation. I guess saying that you are ""going to call ahead"" and then not calling ahead are considered to ""acceptable procedures"" for Cebu Pacific. Never again. Most of the staff were very great during our crisis, except for one representative, whom when we first arrived in Manila and were trying to get to the Macau flight gate as quick as possible, we approached for information about our Macau flight. After calling on his radio, he informed us that the plane had already pulled away from the gate and that we would have to ""go outside and buy another ticket"", without even so much as telling us how sorry he was that the company had caused us to miss our flight.

Early AM departure from ICN, but as this is the only Cebu Pacific flight at that time, no need to arrive 2-3 hours ahead. 1.5 hours was sufficient as ICN has long lines lately in the morning. Slightly late departure, but plane clean and in good condition with friendly, fast crew. Booked exit row seat both directions, but empty rows meant I could move and lay down without any problems. Also used transfer service sold online and onboard and would absolutely recommend. Only two complaints: cabin crew really focuses on selling snacks and drinks too frequently, even on our red eye home departing at 1.50 am with again another pass before arrival at 6 am. Also, they didn't actually black out the cabin for this flight, just dimmed the lights down to faint brown. This made sleep difficult. Seat tip: stretching out in the last row is difficult for any taller person (180 cm for me). The curvature of the plane means a much narrower seat row. Also, the crew has to stay awake, and as such talks throughout the flight in the rear galley. Kalibo airport is tiny and is recommended to use the free lounge across the street. In the evening, five flights to Korea within two hours means a hectic departure area and wait to get into the airport. Wait in the lounge until they call your flight about an hour and a half before departure. Much more comfortable. If using transfer service, you will arrive at 10 pm for 1.50 am flight.

Check-in in MNL was an hour, despite arriving at T3 3.5hrs before departure. Flight was pretty much as before. Really not much to choose between Cebu Pac and PAL on this route - T3 is a much better terminal than T2 but PAL seem to have better slot times, less crowded planes and a better 30kg free baggage allowance.

As we arrived close to 40 minutes late in Manila, we aired our concern to the lead flight attendant after all passengers left only to be rudely said that it was (having my 6'1 friends legroom reduced by a blocking bag) as a very small deal.

Arrived at the domestic airport more than 2 hrs before flight knowing Manila airport is a shocker, and wanted to make sure we allowed plenty of time. Joined a slow moving check in queue, wondering why our flight number wasn't displayed. At exactly 2 hrs before flight departure, a garbled voice announced over the PA ""Cebu flight DG6243 to Caticlan is cancelled"". This was both amusing and worrying, not just cancelled but definitely cancelled ? This was the first we'd heard of it. I happened to look at my phone and lo and behold, a helpful email at the same time alerts me to the cancellation as well. Made it to the front of the queue to be told to join another queue to organise another Cebu Pacific flight. Spending more time at Manila airport than necessary was not appealing, so decided to book another carrier and get a refund from Cebu instead. Misinformation and delays ensued. Ticket office to get refund located outside the terminal, and knowing our new flight would be closing in 30 mins, and stringent security to get back into the terminal, decided to lodge refund request by phone instead. Did this on 5 June, it was approved, and were told it would take a week. Two weeks later still waiting.  2nd Flight - Caticlan to Manila 10 June. Quick checkin this time, though for some reason it took 4 staff to do it ? All giggling and having a great time. Asked if we had a connecting flight from Manila (that should have been a dead giveaway, more later), told them yes, but in 6 hours. Bit of Spanish and more giggling ensued.

To be fair, the delay was caused by air traffic in Manila, but would have appreciated to be told at checkin. Flight ended up being only 45 mins delayed, and when the heavens opened, Cebu ground staff gave us umbrellas to walk across the tarmac.

The flight out was meant to be at midday but was delayed several times with no announcements before we eventually were taken out on the bus to the plane 3.5 hours late. We were taken back to the terminal again and told the flight was cancelled. We were then put on a later flight to Kalibo even though we had paid to fly to Caticlan - this was to leave at 5pm. This flight was then delayed 30 then 60 then 90 minutes finally leaving at 8.45pm. This got us to Kalibo at around 10pm and we then had to get a coach for 2 hours to get us to where we should have been at 1pm. We finally got to our destination at 1:30am - about 12 hours after we should have. The night before we flew back we got an email to say our flight was cancelled and we were to call them to rebook or get a refund. We rang and could not get through to anyone. As a result we had to book a Philippines airline flight at our expense to ensure we got back to Manila for our connecting flight home a total disaster. Trying to get a refund from them for the cancelled flight took over 30 minutes on the phone and it will then be 10 business days until the refund is even processed.

I had to ask to find out and I was told 30mins delay or more. I thought because Kalibo airport is small that's why it seemed so unorganized. I finally get to Manila where I have a connecting flight to Hanoi. And it happens again. Gate changes twice flight delayed without any notification. No one at the gate to assist. No communication whatsoever on why we aren't boarding at the time indicated on our boarding passes. My flight ended up being delayed by over an hour again.

The fare cost AUD150.00. A competing carrier was offering a fare of AUD700.00. A nice touch was entering the aircraft into the cabin not via a galley which is standard of most aircraft designs. Entering directly into the cabin creates the impression of more space. The configuration of the Cebu Pacific A330-200 is tight with only 8 lavatories.

Having flown AirAsia many times I knew the standards of a low cost airline it was pretty much the same. The planes were very quiet (new Airbus A330-300) seats were a little bit smaller and not as comfortable (harder) than AirAsia seats also the recline angle was not as generous but for the price and short distance who cares? A little over cautious on the final security check at the gate on our return flight from MNL total unnecessary (probably not their fault though but rather a requirement set by the Australian Government same thing happens in KL for example). This meant a delayed departure of about 40min they should have allocated more time prior to boarding. Would I fly with them again yes if you love the Philippines and don't care about 'proper airline' service then why not I could even see myself pay $600 for a flight beats flying to KL and then onwards.

cebu-pacific,315539,2014-09-22,1,Japan,,Cebu Pacific customer review,"If you are looking for a cheap easy flight look elsewhere. Cebu lists low rates to get you started on purchasing a ticket by listing a super low price. By the time you're finished making the reservation it might be quite a bit more and by the time they finish ""nickle-and-diming"" you for all the ""extras"" you will have paid more for the flight. In my case I got a round trip ticket from Japan to Manila for what I thought would only be about $300 USD. By the time I finished checking in for my return flight I will have spent more than $700 USD in total. For an international flight that provided no food or water without extra payment. Everything about the flight is cheap. There are no movies no pillows no blankets if buy food on the flight they hand you a hot aluminium case of food (street vendor style) without a tray like other airlines do which makes it all to easy for things to drop away under other seats. In my case I only had so many Philippine Pesos left so I could only afford a dish to eat but couldn't get any water or anything at all to drink. Take my advice if you want a well priced flight that has transparent policies provides food and water during long international flights has movies to watch provides comfort in the cabin (with bedding and providing liquids to drink) choose another airline: for example ANA Singapore Air JAL United.

On Feb 18th Cebu notified me that this route had been cancelled but they would offer me a BKK-MNL-CEBU route and return at no extra charge. I told them that the BKK-Manila they were offering me departing Bangkok at 12.30 in the morning arriving in MNL at 4.50am and then a multi-hour layover in MNL before the late morning flight to Cebu (total flying and ground time of around 9 hours) was not convenient to me and could I take the mid-morning departure from BKK and connection from there. Answer no. I asked if I could take the early morning routing they were suggesting but take a two day layover in MNL (at my own expense) so I could rest and then continue on the late night flight to Cebu. Answer no. They insist I must take the inconvenient departure time and complete my travel in one day.

Flight left on time on both sectors clean cabin but with a broken tray table legroom is restricted and uncomfortable for a red-eye flight since most PAX reclining their seatbacks so it was hard to move. FAs were mixture of smiling and cheerful ladies down to bored but still polite crew and I like that they were proactive in turning on/off the reading lights for the PAX. Buy-on-board choices are good and I think were in the right price too. Overall it was a good value for the money especially for short flights and I would recommend it to those travellers who are on a budget.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,0.0
cebu-pacific,315568,2013-03-14,7,United Kingdom,,Cebu Pacific customer review,BKK-MNL. Flight left 1 hour late though that was beneficial to me. Staff really pleasant and helpful. Plane was clean and cabin announcements clear in both English and Filipino (sometimes I can never hear what's being said). Legroom bad but not unexpected for an economy airline. Food prices very reasonable at about 80p - £1.20 for soft drinks and the same again for snacks. £5 for a meal but didn't try. Only grumble is the shocking seat reclining pitch. If the passenger in front reclines then you can't even bring your tray down. It was a nightmare.

HKG has a well earned reputation as one of the best airports in the world. I love the fact that you can do web check-in with Cebu. It helps when you get to the airport and puts them above some other low cost airlines. Busy flight to MNL but flight on time and in-flight staff are excellent as I've experienced in the past with Cebu. Quick baggage delivery in MNL and terminal 3 is by far the best in MNL. Love the all over free wifi as in HKG. However the experience there during the return to HKG was not quite the same. Cebu staff managed to give us the wrong boarding card which we discovered after going through security (and the associated payment of airport fees). It got fixed but it was the first time I've ever experienced this sort of thing. Made for a stressful departure out of MNL. Better look closely at your boarding pass when flying Cebu. Inflight to HKG was exactly the same as before. Again a very busy flight but friendly in-flight staff and plenty of smiles.

I usually buy the 20kg Baggage Allowance just to avoid the hassle. Both flights were on time even late in the day but arrival into BKK was delayed because the pilot parked incorrectly and had to be pushed back to the correct position... Cabin Service was fine but the flights were quieter than usual I think because many passengers (me included) are flying Tiger from Clark to BKK because in some cases it's half the price of Cebu Pacific who are not significantly cheaper than Philippine Airlines on some routes. I've been looking at prices over the next few months and Cebu Pacific need to be more competitive if they want to fill their planes like they did a few years back.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,

Sat in premium seats up front (row 1) so leg room was definitely not a problem. Arrived in the Budget Terminal but one of the first to leave through Terminal 2 after the Budget Terminal's closure. I just wish they use the tube in Cebu when boarding. Some people tend to forget that 5J is a budget carrier hence buying everything on board the new Hot Meals being offered actually was pretty good a bit expensive but pretty tasty. Really made the cabin smell good. Only suggestion is that they could provide passengers with food trays so things don't get messy or the mess could be kept in the tray since 5J tables are pretty flimsy. Just remember to Bring a good inflight kit (Bedroom/Hotel Slippers Blanket Neck Pillow Eye shades ear plugs headset fully charged iPad and MP3 Player thick socks lip balm and probably something good to eat). All in all a pretty great experience. Cebu - Singapore flights with 5J have always been traditionally on-time.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,

I'd really like to know who gets these so called cheap GO Fares because it doesn't matter how far ahead you book nothing is available on the routes I fly.

cebu-pacific,315491,2011-10-23,5,United States,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Have flown Cebu Pacific many times now. They are cheap unless you have extra bags or extra weight or make last minute changes or miss a plane out of Manila. (get to MNL airport early!). Sometimes the flight leaves before the posted time. Their website is frequently not working correctly. Tried to pay for extra bags and kept getting an error message until after it was past the deadline for adding bags. Then had to pay at the airport extra. You can expect a last minute gate change frequently and you can expect to walk or bus to Term 2 in Manila from the plane even though the plane is sitting right at the enclosed walkway. Carry-on policy is sporadic so going from an International flight to a domestic flight on Cebu Pacific can be tricky and costly. With Cebu Pacific you get what you pay for - cheap flights and not always the greatest in customer service. Most Cebu employees really try hard though.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,

On a daytime flight its fine but at 2am it can be irritating. Also flew MNL-MPH return.

Prices can vary quite a lot from day to day and I've never managed to get one of their so-called very cheap GO Fares. Changes can be expensive and I usually do those at their ticket office in NAIA-3. This terminal is by far the best in MNL. Check-in is efficient in MNL (though less so in BKK) and pre-paying for excess baggage (over 15kg) is now available when you book. Excellent on-time reliability on all flights. For some reason they do run the cabin temperature very cold on the A320 and this can be uncomfortable on a 3 hr+ flight. I've no problem paying for a snack and a drink if the ticket price is significantly cheaper than the competition which it is. No in-flight movies so bring a book.

The queue seems to take forever as the staff are very slow which is not surprising as the admin and ticketing process they have is ridiculous. Multiple pieces of paper stapled together when just a boarding pass would suffice. At Manila expect to wait in line for at least an hour for check-in even if you are early. Every flight we took was at least an hour delayed this caused issues with our connections at the other end. The delays just seem to be a natural occurrence to Cebu Pacific which is probably why they offer no apology when they finally get round to notifying you of the delay.

When checking in I was told that no record existed and because I had missed my previous flight I would have to buy a new and much more expensive ticket.

Quite large variations in price depending on precisely which days you travel. Cebu Pacific used to have very good last minute prices - not any more and the cost to change a travel date was about the same price as the original ticket. They're also cracking down hard on excess baggage - 15kg for checked in bags and 7kg hand carry. Don't expect to haggle an extra few kilos for free - and they're checking (weighing) bags again at the gate. I'll continue to use them in favour of PAL or Thai since their prices are still very competitive their reliability in my experience has been very good and NAIA-3 is by far the best MNL Terminal - just don't carry too much luggage.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes,

We booked and purchased our ticket 3 months in advance. Between that date and the flight date Cebu Pacific called 3 times to change the time of departure. The worst thing happened when they called 6 days before the actual flight date and told us the flight would be cancelled and they would fly us to Kalibo (3 hours away from Caticlan by bus). The airline rep tried to appease us by providing a free bus ride from Kalibo to Caticlan however this would mean we would arrive in Boracay past 7pm instead of the original schedule of 3pm. This in effect wasted 1 entire day and meant we paid for 1 night's hotel stay which was useless. Having no other recourse we agreed but to our horror upon arriving in Kalibo the bus they prepared from Kalibo to Caticlan was not big enough to accommodate all passengers. They had to fit all 13 of our group into 1 small van. Needless to say we have all vowed to never fly this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,1.0,no,

I am disabled and require a wheelchair for long walks. That is always a challenge for any airline to get right. My usual airline, AirAsia, does not charge for a wheelchair if arranged up front. Lion charges a whopping 30.00 SGD for a wheelchair. Now my first piece of advice, do not use Lion Air is you need help getting around. I found that the words ""Customer"" and ""Service"" are fairly unknown. Lion is especially bad with that concept. If there was a zero star rating I would readily give them that rating. I am an American, Indonesia extends what is called a ""Visa on Arrival"" to USA and some other countries. When I went to get my boarding pass the Lion Air employee refused to give me a boarding pass because I did not have an Indonesian Visa in my passport. I tried explaining that I get the visa on arrival. He still refused. I asked for his manager and explained it to her. Finally after much deliberation (and showing where I have done this many times before) they issued my boarding pass. The young man apologized that he was only doing his job. Well I am sorry too but warning people of poor service in this forum is mine. In all fairness most of the people were nice but still did not take care of the customer.

Being extremely tired, we agree. One of the payments didn't process on the credit card so we went to their Lion Air customer service. They fleeced us there too with bad exchange rates. Post that we go in and since one from three tickets was yet to be cancelled and reissued we did that at the machine. The cancellation for which was less than 5 million! And now the flight is delayed.

That being mentioned I can't actually say much about the level of comfort that I get from LCCs you get what you pay! Now lowering down my standard to the level of LCCs Lion Air is a pleasant airline to fly with. What they can do to improve passenger satisfaction is to improve their punctuality.

The major difference between Lion and the rest of the budget carriers is that they do not hawk duty free sales so once meal service is completed passengers are left undisturbed.

Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first.

Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code.

Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight.

My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED.

However, in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and I felt compelled to warn other travellers. Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport. It's now been 3 days, my bag is still in Delhi and IndiGo have no idea what's going on. They don't even know the right number to call at Delhi Airport to get an update. At the end of the day, fly IndiGo if you want a cheap flight and can count on things going according to plan, but don't expect any support if there are any disruptions as they don't appear to have the customer's best interests at heart.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu,Delhi,Chennai,February 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,no,

The boarding also started well on time. One thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions. Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future.

The airline claimed that the flight was cancelled due to Covid restrictions but is clear that the flight was cancelled due to lack of good loads and so instead of the usual travel time of 2.5 hours the total flight duration was almost 6 hours which could have been better. At least during the online check-in the airline didn't charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief. Both the flight segments themselves were quite okay and departed well on time even though some of the conduct of the passengers was questionable like not wearing the face shield / hazmat suit for the middle row seats even despite the crew reminding the passengers to wear it numerous times. Nowadays when flying low cost carriers, it seems like a bus journey with wings where the airlines try to get as many passengers stuffed inside the aircraft as much as possible. If you are a passenger who likes to travel in a bit of exclusivity and luxury without feeling claustrophobic about the number of people surrounding you, you are better off travelling on other airlines. But if however, you prefer getting from point A to point B with slightly cheaper fares, then IndiGo does the job very well.",A320 / A321 Neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai,Kolkata,Hyderabad,January 2021,4.0,4.0,,5.0,,4.0,yes,

We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on.

The aircraft was well maintained and even though every seat was practically full, the crew did well to manage things and requests from fellow passengers. The seat pitch is around 30 inches which is decent enough but might be more uncomfortable for someone taller. The flight was very smooth and the crew were very pleasant and indulged in small talk among the passengers when it came for the in-flight snacks which were kind of pricey. Arrival was on time and the captain of the flight announced that this was his last flight and so all the passengers were requested to send their best wishes to the captain during de-boarding which was a nice touch.

After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he can’t help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to “deal” with us that was even less helpful.

Unfortunately, our flight from San Francisco to Delhi (Via Shanghai) got delayed and we missed the 5:10 am flight from Delhi to Vadodara. The Indigo staff at terminal 2 acted very helpful. They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi. We barely reached to Terminal at 6:35 am. We had to get our tickets modified, checked in and boarding passes printed by 6:40 am to get into the Ahemdabad flight. That is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state. I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed. In couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance. She ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast. Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time! Then she ran with us to the security area, asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate. We got to the gate as last passengers entering!

As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can.

indigo-airlines,254423,2015-02-24,2,India,,IndiGo customer review,Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,no,0.0

I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,yes,0.0

indigo-airlines,254435,2014-10-12,1,India,,IndiGo customer review,Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,1.0

It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger.

Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment.

We flew with kid (not infant, 2 yo paid ticket) and we brought a foldable cabin size pram with no bag, so it couldn't go into the cabin and must be given to the staff at the gate, free of charge. Which is common on most airlines. The ground staffs in Sydney were friendly. But the flight back from Melbourne to Sydney was a nightmare. The flight delayed for hours, after our original flight was canceled a day before. We were not allowed to check the pram in at the gate. The ground staffs weighed all of our carry-on luggages at the gate, including the pram. So the pram was counted and it caused us to exceed the cabin weight limit. We complained because the pram was not an issue on our previous flight. It's weird and unreasonable because how come the rules in Sydney and Melb are different. But the staff did not accept the complaint and gave us 2 non-negotiable options. 1. Pay the extra charge (double from the normal price) or 2. If we are not willing to pay the charge, they will move us to the next flight for us to checked in the pram but it will cost us more money. We often travel with kids and never have a disappointing experience like this. It was obvious they want to upsell us so bad. We feel scammed. Some staff were rude and arrogant. The way they talked to us from the beginning was disrespectful and intimidating. And one of them kept complaining about our not-so-loud kids.

I was happy we were on a Dreamliner 787 for all the good features it delivers. I paid extra for an exit row so I could stand up and avoid a third DVT. In fact the knowledge that I could fly on a 787 both ways confirmed that I would go to Bali. On the return trip, Jetstar changed the aircraft to a A321LR Neo, a narrow bodied smaller plane with no entertainment and a minimum of space to stand and exercise. All previous seat booking disappeared so I tried to again book exit rows. The Jetstar webpage interface was so unaccommodating that it was difficult to execute this so I missed out on the two that were available. I think it is pertinent that I wouldn't even have known the plane had changed except that my travel agent had sent me an email. I received nothing from Jetstar. When I finally did books some seats and Jetstar emailed me my new itinerary, it indicated that I now had no checked luggage even though I had paid for it.

Had a holiday in Queenstown, New Zealand and booked a Scoot flight to Sydney from Singapore, and a Jetstar flight to Queenstown from Sydney. At the start of my trip, I faced no issues entering Sydney with my valid Australian Electronic Travel Authority (ETA), and was promptly cleared by immigration. After which, I took my Jetstar flight to Queenstown, and did not encounter any issue as well. At the end of my Queenstown holiday, I arrived promptly at Queenstown airport to check-in for my Jetstar flight back to Sydney (where I would then take a Scoot flight a couple of hours later from Sydney to my final destination - Singapore). At the Jetstar check-in counter at Queenstown airport, I was asked to present my Australian ETA which I did, and was told by the Jetstar staff that there was an issue with my ETA, because my full name was stated in the Family name field, and told me to apply for a new ETA right then and there. Flabbergasted, (as I had not encountered an issue with my ETA that had allowed me entry into Australia twice before, most recent being the start of my holiday AND my ETA only expired in Mar 2023) I did as I was told and started to apply for a new ETA using the Australian ETA app. As retrieval of passport information via the app is by scanning the chip in the passport, my Full Name auto-populated in the Family name field (and could not be edited). Even on the app, it explicitly said ""For some passport types, the applicant’s given name will appear in the family name field… Please do not rescan the applicant’s passport in these cases as the information is displaying correctly"". I highlighted this to the Jetstar staff and was then told to NOT use the app to apply for a new ETA, and to do via the website instead, which went contrary to what was written on the website ""From 6 April 2022, all ETA-eligible passport holders can now apply for an ETA using the Australian ETA app… At this time, ETA lodgement is only available through the Australian ETA app"". Long story short, as I was not able to reconcile this alleged issue at check-in, the Jetstar staff informed that she would not be able to check me in for my flight, and hence I missed my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, which meant that I also missed my Scoot flight from Sydney back to Singapore. Given that I had to return to Singapore ASAP, I had to spend about SGD$2000 for a one-way last-minute flight ticket back to Singapore from Queenstown, and also spent about SGD$300+ for an unintended additional night's stay in Queenstown given that the next available flight was the next day. Lodged a complaint to Jetstar requesting for an explanation, and was informed that it would take up to 15 days for the Resolutions team to get back to me. 15 days came and gone and I again followed up with Jetstar, who informed that it would take another 5 days to process. 5 days have passed and I have yet to receive any word from Jetstar.

The lack of flight choice without ridiculous stopovers was appalling. And thanks to the airline, we lost an entire day of our trip. But that’s not all.

And once again, this morning we received a message in the middle of the night, telling us our flight (JQ941) has been delayed.

I thought being 11.45pm I would be waiting only like half an hour but no I waited 1.5hr. No call back facility available. Then I get a lady who was very, very rude. I told her about my disappointment since the first time I called was due to Jetstar having messed up my transfer in a way that I missed my connecting flight. No apologies for having waited so long at 1am in the morning or for the inconvenience of cancelling the flight. So I asked her to see what other flight i could take so i could make my connecting flight to which she says and 11am flight but its through Qantas and yours was through jetstar so you will have to pay the difference. I questioned her on this as i said but Qantas and Jetstar are the one company and you are the ones who cancelled the flight not me. To which she retorted `You were the one who chose Jetstar'.

Is the Call centre in Mumbai as only one time out of the 3 times I called I got a clearly spoken customer service agent that resolved my problem swiftly and courteously.

SYD - MEL flight was good, and I can't see myself ever paying extra to fly QF or VA for an hour hop. Everything had to be paid for, but honestly, I didn't mind - you close your eyes and you're there. Seats themselves were not very well padded, but that's to be expected. Legroom was ideal, coming from a semi-tall bloke. Bags came out quickly, had an on-time departure and arrival, service was great. That's to be expected, and from someone who had never flown them before, I felt that what everyone always says about them is misguided - it's a budget airline after all. We took the Skybus from St Kilda to Tullamarine - the last of the day @ 8 pm, so we had to wait around the airport for a bit. However, for a $20.50 fare for two adults (special), the convenience and not having to catch public transport was worth it. Check-in at Tullamarine was easy, as was bag drop, went through security, only to find our flight had been cancelled due to the crew timing out (read - legally worked too long that shift to be able to operate the onward flight) - so, back through the terminal and waiting in a line for help. Thank god we got there when we did, because the queue stretched for ages right after we arrived. The good thing is, it's super easy to change your flight when it's cancelled. We originally changed our flight to a 6:05 am departure with Jetstar, but seeing the provided accommodation was in Preston - a good 45mins away by taxi, we tried to get a better flight - also seeing that people had been able to change to Qantas flights. They are constantly loading more flights and options into the system in the event of a cancellation, so we asked to see if there was anything better they could do for us, and it turns out that there was a Virgin flight the next day leaving at 9AM. This suited us, and we were set. The accommodation they provided was great - fairly modern and gave us meal vouchers to use at the hotel - we used them for breakfast, which was okay, but I would use them for dinner depending on when you need to go there if you're in the same situation. They also reimburse you for any taxi services you need to get to and from the airport - however you need to coordinate this yourself after the journey is done. However, the lady coordinating the giving out of hotels at Tullamarine was rude. Too sassy for her own good, we tried making conversation with her and all she could do was give snarky comments back - when she was literally doing her scheduled job (write people's names down on a list), at her normal shift time. We're the ones being delayed here - you're getting paid. Cut the attitude. However, everyone else at the service desk was friendly, which was good. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Jetstar again given my experience on the first flight, but it's also good knowing they have a good system for cancellations - you're covered even if they're unable to fly. And, for paying $150pp incl bag, getting a free hotel, taxi service, and a widebody Virgin flight the next day with inc food and entertainment was great value for money. Thanks for cancelling my second flight, Jetstar. It couldn't have gone better, for me at least :)",A321 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne,Perth,,January 2020,3.0,4.0,,4.0,,5.0,yes,

jetstar-airways,710412,2020-01-26,1,United States,Trip Verified,"""was very disappointing""","Queenstown to Auckland. Our experience with Jetstar Airways on a flight in New Zealand was very disappointing due to the disruption in the flight, the subsequent lack of communication, and the promises of staff that were not supported by corporate. Jetstar experienced a countrywide failure in their computer systems causing manual processing leading to delayed flights. Our flight was delayed over 4 hours causing our connection to the US to be missed. There was no later flight, so an overnight stay was required. There was no communication about status - the flight boards were not updated. In fact the board showed that we had arrived, when in fact we hadn't even left. I was not able to pursue changes with the connecting flight airlines because they showed the flight on time.  Upon arrival in Auckland I was informed we would be transported to a hotel and provide meals. Later I was told the transportation would not be provided but we could take the Skybus and submit expenses for reimbursement. I asked if there was more than one hotel for the brand and was told no. When I got to the Skybus counter, I was asked which of the two hotels for that brand. I went back to the ticket counter to get the specific location, and by the time I returned we had missed the bus. Upon arrival in Auckland there was a long (1km) walk to the hotel. Upon checking out the next day we were advised that the hotel was paid, and a $30 credit for meals was applied. The latter in direct conflict with written policy that it should've been $60 and further that the airport representative stated that would not be limited to $60. Upon return to the airport the next day, there was no one available to handle the reimbursement request so we submitted the request for expense reimbursement online ($167). After waiting over a week past the processing timeline I followed up via chat. At which time I was advised that they would not support reimbursement of any kind despite the statement of staff. No avenue for escalation was provided. I accessed their chat complaint system, uploading all of the original documents supporting the reimbursement request. I was on the chat for 2 and ¼ hrs. and asked redundant questions and then to be advised there is no reimbursement. At one point the individual stated there is no reimbursement when in home city, which was blatantly wrong as it was clear my home city is in the US. Thankfully, Jetstar did arrange and pay for the hotel as they obviously acknowledged the need.

Arrived at the counter and one has to check in and also tag their own bags. I had no problem once I was able to find a working kiosk and one that was available. The lines were unbelievably long due to most people having no idea how to check in at the kiosk and were dumbfounded with the bag tag. It was mass chaos and no one from JetStar assisting in any way. I had done my research and paid for my extra baggage and carry-ons before arrival. By the time you pay for the extras, believe me, I spent much more than if I just flew Qantas or Virgin. But Jetstar had the flight schedule I needed. Arrived at the gate, weighed my carry-on and the customer service rep tagged my bag. We sat there and sat there. No plane, no announcements. Then about 200 other passengers descended upon our gate. Something was up. No gate agents at the desk. Finally an announcement of a gate change. I move to the new gate. There is a plane. We sit for another 30 minutes, I'm suspect there is a problem as we are scheduled to fly an A321 and an A320 is at the gate, which will not accommodate all the passengers. Suddenly, I watch all of the gate agents pack up and leave. No announcement, nothing. They just walk away and disappear. Again, I get up and walk over to the departures board and see that again we have a new gate. I go back and announce it to those of us sitting at a gate. We all move to the new gate per the board. An announcement was never made of the gate change and passengers were running all over the place, confused, furious - mass chaos. Finally we board. I'm sitting in the first row 1A, extra room seat and I paid the premium for it. I notice that I'm sitting in a wet seat and the carpeting is soaked and squishy. The cabin manager, who is professional, gregarious and superlative in customer service briefs us on operating the emergency exit and then we sit and wait. We sit and we sit. The PA of the plane is not working. The cabin crew notices the water and the wet carpet. Mechanics determine that due to the heavy rains, someone left the door open and the water affected the electrics of the PA system. We sit as they try to fix it. Of course the plane is taken out of service, and our cabin crew is now illegal and we disembark. We gather again in the gate, and remarkably a new plane was promised and delivered. At this point, the gate agents were finally competent and doing their jobs. I have to say I found the cabin crews to be excellent and I felt very safe flying Jet Star. The hassle one experiences at the gate is absurd to say the least. Flying is bad enough on a full service carrier, so why torture yourself with JetStar.

They made me open my bags in front of everyone, I had to pull out some clothes to wear. They then noticed my partner was with me and made her weigh her bags too. In the end, they made us pay $65 each. The ironic thing is that we flew from Japan with no dramas, same airline. Our bags already had the carry on tags which even the Jetstar staff let people through when they saw these tags on peoples carry ons as they walked in. I guess we were just unfortunate as we were singled out and made an example of. Safe to say this will be the last time we will fly with this atrocious airline. We rather pay that little extra to fly with a flagship airline, at least they provide in-flight meals, fly direct, and you don't have to buy your luggage, which is probably how Jetstar lures people in with their so called ""cheap fares"".

I read all the horrible reviews and thought, aw c’mon, how bad can they really be? Well, here it is. Booked a non-stop flight from Honolulu to Melbourne scheduled to depart 8AM and arrive about 10-1/2 hours later on October 1st. Arrived at the airport and stood in the check-in line only to find out that the flight was cancelled. No advance notice whatsoever! We were sent away to a hotel shuttle after being assured that we should be rescheduled for the next day and would be notified later in the day in any event. After hearing nothing from Jetstar by early afternoon, we logged into their website to discover that we had been rebooked for 8:30AM on October 5th, connecting through Sydney with a 7-hour layover! So, instead of a direct 10:30 journey, we were now spending 3 nights waiting for a 19-hour journey and all without even the courtesy of a notification. To make matters worse, when my wife and I finally got on the plane, we discovered that we were not even seated together on this wonderful replacement flight and we had paid extra for our seats on the original flight. Plus, it gets even better. Jetstar does not transfer luggage between an international and domestic flight on the same ticket so we needed to collect our bags in Sydney and drag them around the airport with us for 5-hours because Jetstar will not accept bags until 2-hours before a flight. This also meant that we could not get through security to reach a decent restaurant for those 5-hours as well and needed to just hang out in the outer airport by the ticket counters. But this still was not the end of our ordeal. As a cherry on top, we were rewarded by the likes of a very nasty counter clerk who insisted that the very same bags that we had dragged over from international were now 2kg overweight each and demanded another $60! What happened? Did our bags pick up 4kg of grime off the airport floors as we dragged them around behind us for the past 5-hours?

On return from Singapore on 19th, however, your check-in clerk first demanded to see my Thai Residence Card. Of course there is no such thing as I explained to the clerk’s evident displeasure, and implied disbelief. Then she wanted to know which bag was mine. My wife and I had one suitcase for our clothes, one bag for our shoes and paraphernalia, and one hand bag each. Check-in bags weighed just over 32 kg. I had purchased 20kg of luggage, and my wife had purchased 15kg so I had no concerns over weight. However your clerk insisted that luggage cannot be combined, and that one bag must be mine, and the other could be my wife’s, so I agreed that the suitcase could be mine, whereupon she demanded payment for 7kg overweight on “my” case, despite the total being well within our purchased 35kg. Naturally I was not attracted to her proposal. So then I had to remove some contents of the suitcase and put them in the shoe bag, remove bulky but light items from the shoe bag and put them in a new carry-on bag purchased from Smiths, and make my carry-on briefcase into a check-in bag. This took a lot of time, so your clerk wanted me to do that away from check-in because I was now causing a backlog in the queue. Of course this was impossible, because I needed access to the scales to balance each bag to a spurious amount. The frustration mounted in all quarters. Your clerk told me “it’s not my fault it’s Company policy”. I told her she represented the Company, and that this was unacceptable. Certainly I would not permit one of my staff to say that. We finally got our boarding passes, no money had changed hands, everyone was frustrated, no-one benefited, I was thoroughly stressed, and we had lost all the time we had planned to spend in the airport. Then I saw that your clerk had not given my wife and I adjoining seats. “All other seats are taken, and this is the closest I can give you” she told me. This was a lie. When I took my seat, both seats next to me were empty and so were the entire two rows in front of me.

The flight to Cairns is just over 3 hours and was without incident, the staff went about their role in a business-like manner and provided food and drinks to purchase. The flight back was not quite as good. The forward toilet had the ""engaged"" light on from the start and I decided to check it out, there was a lady waiting who said that one of the flight attendants said there was someone in there. We concluded that if that was the case then due to the time they were in there they may have had a medical incident, so I decided to open the door. I discovered that there was no one in there but someone had thrown up in the sink and it was still there. In the meantime one of the flight attendants returned and proceeded to reprimand me for opening the door. Another flight attendant was talking to a passenger and was doing so for a large portion of the trip, another was in the last row reading a book. A couple of observations, the toilet appeared to be blocked from the time of leaving Cairns, why was it not fix prior to departure? There appeared to be a lack of service from the flight attendants. No information was passed on to the passengers regarding the forward toilet being out of action. An incident like this doesn't mean that Jetstar is a bad airline. There may be a need to train the staff on their attitude. Maybe their attitude is ""this is a budget airline so suck it up"".

Once I booked I felt like I had made a mistake after seeing all of this bad reviews. I chose jetstar as the timing was great for me and so was the price. About $60 cheaper than air new zealand. I had just flown in from the UK and had checked myself in online and used the self service kiosk at Auckland airport to get the baggage tags. Auckland airport did have quite a long queue. Flights to queenstown, Christchurch, Dunedin & wellington were checking in. But the airport is very small so you wasn’t missing anything past check in anyway. Took me around 10 mins wait to get to the front (baring in mind that I was about the 40th behind so pretty fast. The lady at check in wasn’t particularly polite. But I was infront of her for less than 30 seconds. Passed me a boarding card and off I went. I know my luggage was about a kilo over too but nothing was mentioned and I didn’t need to pay any fee - however, if I did have to I wouldn’t have complained and blamed the airline. this is my problem. I know the baggage allowance and so does everyone else!!. Baggage wasn’t weighed for cabin, though they said several times that 7kg is the limit. So again, anyone who is over and charged the €60... there are NUMEROUS announcements before check in, and also information online about this so if you’re over you have to pay. I don’t understand the annoyance. Flight left on time & arrived on time. Pleasant crew, 3 female air hostess and a cabin manager called Dave. Was very nice. 2 females in the cockpit.

After our flight we landed in Denpasar (Bali), we went to collect our luggage, stood there for an hour and my bag was no where to be found. After talking to the luggage people at the Denpasar airport, they have gave us a piece of paper and we had not heard anything else. We then put in a claim with Jetstar and waited to hear back from them, we found out our luggage had never actually left Brisbane, where we departed from. This was extremely frustrating as we were in a foreign country with no more then a couple pieces of clothes. Meanwhile waiting to hear back from Jetstar we had to spend a lot of money just to accomodate ourselves with clothes and everyday necessities. We had money, expensive clothes and undergarments in this bag. We finally heard from Jetstar 2 days into our trip saying our baggage was in Bali and they would deliver it to us at our villa. We sent our address and never heard back, here we are leaving and still don’t have our luggage. We went a week without anything, we constantly emailed Jetstar to see what they would do to compensate for this massive problem and they showed no compassion or care for what has happened and have only told us to wait. Luckily a nice man at the Denpasar airport has located our luggage and has set it up on our flight back home and that is the service we wanted. Jetstar has still not done anything at all to help, fix or apologise for this entire issue.

He said I had a minimum of $60 to pay so I did, less then 2 mins later a lady tells me they overbooked the plane and I didn’t have a seat even though I booked months prior to our trip. They got us a seat on a Virgin plane and their baggage limit was different being 23kg per person so we absolutely did not need the extra $60 dollars worth that I spent on a different plane and airline. I went back to the man who charged us extra for a refund and he said he can’t do anything so we had to go online and talk to someone else for almost an hour but she just made excuse after excuse not to just give us the refund.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane,Melbourne,,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no,

My experiences: - $120 to change a flight when the original flight was weeks out from departing. Flights are delayed all the time. Of the 13 flights I've taken, 3 have been delayed and 1 has been cancelled. Not a great track record. - They now weigh all baggage to the nearest gram. $60 fee if you're even slightly over. Explain to me how this isn't a money grab. Myself, a 65kg male with a bag weighing 7.1kg, gets charged $60 for an overweight bag when a larger man, probably 120kg+ has an underweight bag and is considered fine. If this actually about weight cumulative weight, my extra 100g would not make a difference. As said, one of my flights was cancelled. Fine, no worries, it happens. The problem is their customer service and focus, or lack thereof on customer satisfaction. Jetstar informed me that I would receive my refund in 7 working days. Warning: This is a lie. I attempted to fly on the 6th January 2019, this flight was cancelled. It is now the 26th April 2019 and still no refund to be seen. I called them today to which I was put on hold for half an hour and told was there was a 'technical glitch'. This 'glitch' seems a little coincidental when I'm asking for money back, especially from a company that loves to money grab at the slightest opportunity and lies about returning refunds. I digress. In my case, they cancelled the last flight out on a Sunday evening to which I had to spend an extra $100 to get to work the next day - not impressed. Might I add 0 compensation for this. You can tell Jetstar is an awful company to work for and their customer support policies highlight that. The girl dealing with my refund call said 'I'm sorry sir, I can understand why you are frustrated but I'm just following company policy'. I told her that my frustrations are not toward her but toward Jetstar as a company and how they operate. I've been on the other side of that coin in hospitality, I know how a disgruntled customer feels. I expressed to her that my frustrations were not with her, told her to enjoy her day and thanked her for her help. She thanked me at the end of the call for my understanding and to quote, I was the 'first person to ever say that'. Back to the point.

Often our major complaint is the the poor customer service, the lack of service and the grossly rude staff. This trip however was Jetstar's worst example of service to date. With my elderly mother in-law traveling with us we requested assistance as she suffers from MS. In Melbourne we were convinced to use a buggy instead of a wheelchair. As many of you know there is a lengthy corridor to the gates so assistance was required, she cannot walk more than a couple of hundred metres without stopping for an extended period. By the time we reached the service area after security there was a sign stating they were closed. No buggy, no wheelchair and an elderly passenger pushing herself to the gate down that long corridor. Once in Tasmania, her legs and knees swelled so badly we could not walk anywhere at all. Our days were spent sightseeing from a car, evenings at home, no outings, no dinner and no shopping because what little energy and strength she had was used to walk to and from the house and car. We cancelled dinner reservations, wine tasting and MONA. As a family we know how to manage her condition, all of this inflammation in her legs was a direct result of her Friday walk and when we tried to explain this Jetstar staff were dismissive and naturally did not want to accept responsibility. On our return we were overweight with our carry-on only baggage. We are only to assume we were overweight on our way to Tasmania given that at absolutely no point did anyone check our bags in Melbourne or weigh them so we assumed we were fine. Owning this mistake we unhappily paid the exorbitant $60 fee to check an 11-12kg bag. At this time we discussed that nobody checked our bags at check in at the counter, nobody asked if Anjutta required assistance, nobody did their job yet again but had the nerve to cripple us on check in at the gate. We have no problem folllowing rules, process and guidelines as this is very familiar territory for us however all we ask for Jetstar is that you ensure your business upholds the quality, consistency and values it preaches. It is simply another example of your poor service and more importantly your lack of consistency from airport to airport. This is a training issue and an onboarding issue, you cannot run a successful business unless your employees are being taught and upheld to the highest standards.

Yesterday I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Bali around 5:45 pm. Firstly, I got a message from Jetstar about delay for 2,5 hours due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Then after arriving to the airport for 2,5 hours later as was said we had to wait for another hour to be seated. When all passengers were finally seated the pilot announced that there is a small problem regarding air conditioner and we needed to wait for technicians to fix it. 1 h later the pilot apologised again and announced that the problem was almost fixed and we were expecting to depart soonish. After 1 hour more which was in total 2 hours of waiting on a plane we were informed that we weren’t able to depart that day and were asked to leave the aircraft. Then the lady on a check in desk advised calling helpline to figure out what my next steps are. So I immediately contacted Jetstar and after chatting with a staff member of the helpline the nearest available flight which they could provide was in 4 days after my actual one which means that I am going to lose 5 days of my holidays! I understand that technical issues can happen but to not accommodate and suggest a flight that would arrive 5 days later is ludicrous! You have effectively ruined more then half of my holiday. I had to buy another ticket through another airline and also requested a refund for my canceled flight because there was no point of flying 4 days later. However, customer service said that they would not reimburse for my accommodation and transport (for the extra incurred directly arising from jetstars failure). I will never ever fly through Jetstar airline again. Yes they have lower price in comparison to Qantas for example but it’s not worth it.

JQ117 leaves Singapore at 5.20am and arrives Perth 12.30pm, with a 50min stop in Bali on the way. On this trip this A320 aircraft was 1 of 3 versions and had more legroom because the seat pocket was above the tray table. Other Jetstar flights I've flown domestically and internationally, my knees hit the seat in front due to the layout and lower seat pockets, so i was very pleased with legroom, however the seats are lacking some serious padding and if the seat behind you puts something in the seat pocket and closes their tray table, the object pokes you in the back. We were lucky to get row 4 and I was actually seated next to a Jetstar employee who was hitching a ride back to Perth after working the same trip in reverse the previous day. The 1st leg I unsuccessfully tried to sleep for the 1st 30mins as we had been in transit at Changi airport for about 9hrs. I then struck up conversation with the Jetstar employee the next 1.5hrs went quickly with conversation and soon we descended for landing. On arrival at Bali all passengers had to disembark with all luggage etc, even though the same aircraft was our aircraft continuing to Perth and our seats were exactly the same.. this is probably the most poorly organised part of the trip. We disembarked at gate 9b, the last and furthest gate of the terminal. The transit lounge, as we followed signage on and on is at the other end of the terminal, where our tickets and passports were checked again, then security check again, where we lost our water bottles again (you learn to travel with empty bottles because every time you go through security you lose it). The metal detector was so sensitive, the only metal my wife was wearing was her wedding bands and it still set off the sensor and she gad to be scanned manually. Meanwhile all this walking and lines for checks takes up quite a bit of time, so by the time we were through ( and remembering we were in the front of the the aircraft so we disembarked fairly quickly), they started final boarding call for our flight. We checked the monitors - go to gate 9b, looking down the long terminal we couldn't even see N o9 so we started our brisk walk, 3 kids in tow. At about 1/2 way 1 child needed a toilet stop so three kept going and I waited, hearing again the final boarding call. We basically jogged the next 4 gates thinking we would muss it. On arrival at the gate my flustered wife and 2 kids were waiting, unable to board because I had all the tickets and passports. Anyway, another line up for another security check, this time full open all bag checks? Thos that somehow found time to buy water, lost them again, I was down to my last empty bottle. Finally boarded to find my Jetstar friend still beside me and hadn't had to disembark, they couldn't believe we had all just had to go the full length of the airport twice and 2 more security checks to get back on the same aircraft,  by this time my wife and I were pretty annoyed. We had to wait a while for all passengers to board, the last passengers being 3 quite elderly people who were also very flustered and short of breath, i felt sorry that they to had to walk that marathon. I was told i could refill my water on the aircraft, I asked several times but never got it.

After reaching the gate and having my carry on luggage weighed and being over by 3kg, I was told I would need to go and check it in for $60. Back out of the departure lounge I go, passing the security I just waited 20 minutes to go through and to the service desk where I would recite that my carry on baggage is over the designated amount and that I have been told to have it put under the plane. The staff member on the service desk re-weighs my bag and tells me that it doesn't need to go under the plane, I just need to pay $30 for an extra baggage allowance, which I do, and then he puts a tag on my mini suitcase and handbag and we proceed back towards the even larger cue at the security check. At this point I'm a little bit annoyed that I had to walk out and re do this process just to be told that my bag doesn't need to go under the plane, however, I was the one who went over the weight limit so I don't mind. After getting back to the terminal where my plane is boarding I am singled out by the staff member who originally told me I needed to go pay extra to have my bag put under the plane. I tell him that I have just been out to the service desk and already had my baggage sorted. He said no, grabbed my bag from me and put it on the scales. Said that it needed to go under the plane and started telling me callously that he told me this already and that it's my fault- I would have to pay an additional $60 and have it checked in. It had been a long morning and after being sent here and there I was emotional (my anxiety caving in around me) and against my best efforts, started crying. This elicited no sympathy, only a defensive manner of tone from the staff member. I tried telling him again that I had followed his instructions which led me to the service desk who then told me otherwise. Thank God my boyfriend was there to help communicate because I was a mess. The lady who processed the payment was helpful and caring,  in the end instead of charging me $60 on top of the recently paid $30 she only made me pay the difference. It was the lack of communication and knowledge of policy by staff members as a whole, and the rudeness and belittling nature encountered by one staff member in particular that has made me decide I will not be flying with this airline again nor will I be recommending it.

Jetstar had a great price for flights, so we told our families we would be able to afford Christmas at home with them so long as they knew that we wouldn't be able to afford additional Christmas gifts. We each had 1 hiking backpack (to their low expectation of 30lbs per check-bag - which is 50lbs with every other airline), each had 2 small backpacks as a carry-on, and packed 2 suitcases of things we decided to fly home with us as we had accumulated quite a few things while living there on a Working Holiday Visa.

I had prepaid for check-baggage prior to the flight - only to realize that the bags were limited to 30lbs, and that I wasn't able to purchase additional baggage (I assumed I'd be able to purchase these 2 additional bags once we arrived at the airport). I assumed wrong. We arrived at the airport with our pre-weighed carry-on backpacks and our 30lb check bags. I planned to pay the same steep rate of $115 per additional check-bag (of only 30lbs and not the regular 50lbs) once we got there, though while checking in, we were told that was not an option and that we would need to pay $25 per kg.

We paid $1400 ($700 each) for our flights, $230 for our pre-paid luggage, and then would have paid $1300 dollars extra to get 2 suitcases home - both at 50lbs. More than our flights! We stepped aside and sorted through our luggage to decide what we were able to bring home. We narrowed our bags down to 1 suitcase and packed it to 20 kilos. We were charged an additional $500 for 1 suitcase  to fly back home. A whole suitcase of Christmas gifts had to be thrown out as we could not afford to take it home to our families. We found a security guard, asked him if he had kids, and said Merry Christmas. I wish it had ended there. The lady checking us in couldn't put our payment through as her computer wasn't working. When she finally got us checked in, her payment terminal wasn't functioning. Once the payment was put through, we had to move over to someone else that then printed our boarding passes for us.

I said I had the receipt for the paid checked-in bags. She looked through the computer again and said she still had to charged me for the two checked in bags. I could not believe it! It does not make any sense. I said I was not going to pay again because she could not find it. It is a form of incompetence. She then said ""I am not going to serve you anymore.

But it's very difficult to travel on this airline without thinking that they take every opportunity to shakedown their customers. In the departure lounge, I witnessed people being asked for more money for their carry-on. Thanks to other posters on this site, I knew in advance to check in my bag (which other airlines accept as carry-one without question), so it didn't affect me personally. I had bought a starter-plus bundle, which at the time of purchase was claimed to offer standard seat allocation, a baggage allowance, frequent flyer points, and a snack. When I received the itinerary, there was no mention of the snack. Equally, when I received the boarding pass, there was no mention of the snack, either, but there was a four digit code, so I asked a crew member at checkin what the four digit code was and she replied that it was because I had paid to have my seat allocated in advance (seat allocation is part of the starter-plus bundle). When the cabin crew were promoting the sale of snacks and drinks, they said that they would accept Mastercard, Visa, or American Express, but they said nothing about people who had bought the starter-plus bundle. When the crew member serving snacks got to my seat, I showed her the boarding pass and asked her if it entitled me to a snack. Yes, she said, your choice up to $10. Why don't they print this on the boarding pass and announce it when about to serve snacks? I nearly went without – I thought I must have got the wrong idea about what was included in the starter-plus bundle. I can't help but get the feeling the airline wanted me (and other starter-plus customers) to forget the fact that the bundle includes a snack. No doubt it's more profitable if people pay for a second time, or go without, as I nearly did.

Although we had to pay the extra surcharge for 30 kg's of checked luggage each the price was very reasonable (Considering a similar flight in Canada would probably be double the cost). Prior to boarding I saw another Jetstar flight weighing carryon baggage to make sure that everyones carryon baggage met the standard of 7kg. I was a little worried because although we only had a backpack each, 7kgs is not a lot of weight. However, when it was time for our flight to board we did not have to weigh our carry on bags.

We're sorry your flight has been cancelled."" Bit of a pathetic apology, but I jumped online immediately to investigate. This was due to bad weather - so not Jetstar's fault, but their responsibility to compensate none-the-less especially considering other airlines were still flying from Sydney, and I was paying for a promised service. My reason for booking a late flight was that I was working my part time job (ie.can't afford the higher fares for Qantas or Virgin) in the day and needed to fly from Sydney to Melbourne for a job interview. The interview was at 9am on Thursday, so the alternative afternoon flights they were offering on Thursday afternoon were not a solution. I was told that I could swap my flight for an afternoon flight on Thursday, or morning flight on the Friday. Or a voucher for the amount of the cancelled flight. I explained that my reason for travel was a job interview in the morning (not just leisure or an unimportant trip) and therefore an afternoon flight was pointless. I could not be flexible - not to mention my return flight to Sydney was scheduled for 3pm. Arrive in Melbourne at 1pm and return to Sydney at 3pm the same day?? I told them I had no need for a change of time and date unless that change landed me in Melbourne in time for my interview. I was given more options (and then fewer options) for Thursday afternoon or Friday, and not one that actually properly compensated me for this cancellation. A voucher provided in five business days was not a solution, and with no extra planes added the following day to compensate for the hundreds of passengers put out; I was left with no solutions, and out of pocket. Finally I agreed to their only form of refund (despite the assistant explicitly saying at one point Jetstar can refund cash depending on the reason...ie whether they deem it worthy). It was this point that I was offered the amount for the cancelled flight, only. They still tried to charge me the cost of the return flight despite cancelling my initial flight! The attempt to still charge me for the return flight, after an hour of nil solutions, was enough to firm my mind. Avoid Jetstar. They do not care about their customers. They are a budget airline because they take advantage of their customers to make a profit. I could only just afford the flight to an interview.

I do not have any solid travel dates but knew that I had to be in Australia by April 16th. I was told at the ticket counter that I could not board unless I had a flight out of New Zealand. This is my fault as I misunderstood the conditions of traveling into a country via visitor's visa vs. a working holiday visa. I was under the impression I could enter the country as long as I had enough money to purchase a flight out of the country. I had to book my flight at the ticket counter and fast since my flight was about to leave. I booked through kayak.com. I purchased insurance as I was under the impression I could use it to change or cancel my flight if I needed to.

I've talked to their customer service team about 4 or 5 times and they do not care about their customers. They won't even offer me a refund via voucher. The insurance I purchased to Allianz is a farce as well. The box I checked to purchase the insurance said it covered cancellations and changes to your flight.

There was no back-up plan nor any other flight options made available except to call the customer service team. The next available flight was the following day – the 5th (the original date I booked) and which we were told that we could confirm our presence 3 hours prior to the departure time. We called back 12 hours later and we were told that nothing could be done because the flight is now full. We needed to wait for 2 more days for the next available flight. When we asked if we could book other tickets back to Kuala Lumpur with the cost fully reimbursed the customer service answered that this is subject to the approval from the claims department. It is obvious that booking flights at such a last minute will be extremely costly, which defeats the purpose of purchasing the cheap fares from Jetstar months in advance. So no flight, no other options, except to accept the refund of the money paid or wait for the next flight out. To add on, the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful. Upon checking-in in New Zealand for our flights back to Melbourne, we spoke to the customer service at the airport. In less than 15 minutes, they confirmed 2 seats for us for the 5th December which was what we have been told that the flight was full.

Bearing in mind that we have a transit at the Singapore airport, the email stated arrival time to be 1840 hour whilst the departure from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was at 1945 hours. However on the plane, the captain announced that the ETA was at 1930. Logically speaking, we expected that the Jetstar crew would have had the information for passengers who are transiting in Singapore for the KL flight.

When it was our turn, he quickly briefed us on the flight to be taken then next day and the accommodation provided for the night. I asked if we had any other options and all he answered was no because that was the last flight and that is all they can do.

In comparison, all the AirNZ / Virgin Australia check-ins operating (about 6 or so) and they have self service check-ins - hence no real queue there. Therefore my rating for Jetstar, and Qantas for that matter, for check-in service out of Queenstown is 1/10. While I can't rate the delayed flight home at this point, on balance, everything about the flight to Queenstown from Auckland was great. Easy check-in, no delays and comfortable enough flight (although we were lucky and had 6 seats between the 4 of us) on which the crew were great. So 9/10 for that part of the trip. Overall I'll rate my Jetstar experience so far 5/10 and I would recommend them to friends and family but it will come with a warning that you generally get what you pay for.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ZQN,AKL,,July 2016,3.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,yes,

That meant I would have had to dispose of a few items packed in my checked luggage. (I was not able to check my bag through from HBA to CHC). When check-in for my flight finally opened, I found that I was slightly over the carry-on weight limit. This meant packing my laptop and charger in my 20kg allowance. Thus no laptop or charger to use while waiting for departure. At self check-in, the JQ system could only recognise me on a flight which would take me to the wrong destination. As directed, I approached a check-in agent, weaving my way through many JQ staff who seemed intent on chatting with one another, and ignoring passengers.

Hate the electronic window shading, was in control of the cabin staff so it was either all open or all dark. It was a night flight and I was watching the huge fires and some wicked lightening storms till they darkened the windows for people to sleep. Sorry but what was happening out the window was better than the in-seat entertainment. The seat has plenty of leg room but I don't think there was one seat where the recline/foot rest worked properly - there was a lot of times when the cabin crew were wrestling with seat. Recline is huge but you're reclining into the space of the person behind you. It happened to me - the tiny TV drops to where you can't view it unless your neck is double-jointed. You can't get up to go to the toilet without some contortions and using the headrest of the seat in front and then you receive that disgusted look because you woke them up.  Entertainment small screen was just that, small, very small and not great quality. And I ran out of movies to watch about 3 hours from touchdown on a 7.5 hour flight. What an awful poor choice - and in Business class! Food not quite as good as other airlines economy food. I was in row 2 of business class and they ran out of the first choice in row 2. Well actually they didn't run out because our friends (also in row 2) shortly after being fobbed off with the fish, noted that row 2 and 3 of the other side of the business cabin got the first choice. So that's a bit of an insult to be told that it's out to then watch people being served it after you. First choice - a Pie, no veggies, no potatoes, nothing but a pie! Had to check I was in business class! Drinks offer a good choice, and always there if you wanted it. Cabin staff were mainly good and attentive (not that we wanted much) but a bit disappointed with the lack of checking for meals. Goodies Pack was great:- earplugs, eye mask, toothbrush, tube socks (not so great), hand cream, lip balm, neck pillow and the bag it came in can be used as a computer tablet bag. There is one thing that all airlines should realize; tube socks don't work in the toilet (think about it). Ground service I've marked low for one reason - although we were the first off the plane we were last away from the baggage carousel as our bags came out last (that will teach us to be first at the airport!)

I provided all necessary details, again, and the overseas customer service lady tried to appear helpful by saying the cancellation was due to engineering difficulties and that she would try to put me on the partner airline Qantas to Melbourne. She asked me to wait so I waited - and waited for a very long time then, she hung up! Desperate to try to redeem the weekend I called again and went through the entire wait routine again. This time the lady informed that all flights were fully booked but if I could get out to Sydney airport in 8 minutes we may be able to catch the 5:30 flight! By this time it was 4:52 peak hour traffic time and although we live in Chifley, about 20 minutes to the airport with no traffic, this was totally impossible - it was Friday afternoon peak hour! While waiting and talking on the phone I had logged on to the internet to find that there were some available seats on Jetstar flights going to the alternate Melbourne airport, Avalon, same night. I asked if we could possibly be booked onto one of these flights as although it was very inconvenient we would still be able to arrive in Melbourne that night and join other family members who were already successfully travelling to Melbourne from various locations using other airlines. I was informed that if I did this I would have to pay for the flight again as it was not to the same airport and that I would not be refunded. I asked if I could speak to her manager and she said that was not possible, she would read out my options which were to cancel and apply for a refund through customer care which would take 15 days! or she could book me on a flight the next day, 12:45pm was the earliest - a night and day of our 2 day holiday ruined as we had to return to Sydney the next day Sunday at 6:30 pm. I explained and she said all I could do was present my case to customer care. I asked if she could put me through to ""customer care"" and she said she did not have a phone number for ""customer care"" and that I had to go online, email them and wait for them to examine my case (up to 15 days as above). Totally frustrated I asked again to talk to the manager. She said she would put me through to someone then left and again I waited for a long time. There was no response on the line so I called again same wait process and asked the woman not to hang up on me this third time and that I wanted to know if I took a flight that night on their partner airline would they refund me for the flight I had already paid for and pay the cost difference for the new flights, this cancellation being Jetstars eng. fault (there were still seats on these other flights).

On arriving at Sydney T2 we found that we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the scheduled 15.20 departure. This meant trying to find somewhere to sit in a heavily overcrowded departure lounge while guarding our luggage. The preferred method of checking in seemed to be using one of a row of machines which very efficiently printed our boarding cards and luggage labels. But when we went to the ""Bag Drop"" we were told to wait at the back of the queue. I'm still not sure if everybody in front of us had already checked in at the machine or not. The Jetstar staff member at check-in weighed our 4 hold cases. We'd paid for four x 20 kgs, but all of them only came to 70 kgs. We knew we were allowed 7 kgs per person for hand luggage. When we were asked to redistribute 2 kgs. weight from one case into other pieces of hand luggage which were underweight, we were shocked. We were 10 kgs under on hold baggage! A little common sense would show that we'd already paid more than enough for extra luggage. We'd flown Tigerair from Melbourne to Sydney and their luggage policy seemed far more reasonable - same weight restrictions but as long as the total does not exceed your limit it doesn't matter how it is distributed. Onboard we had serious problems with fellow passengers. We were seated together 27C my wife, 27D myself, 27E my daughter's boyfriend and 27F my daughter. There were 7 men aged 28-35ish seated 25C,D,E,F and 26D,E and F. They were very boisterous from the start, shouting and swearing at each other. Then they ordered beers repeatedly until one of the attendants refused to serve them more alcohol. They became more rowdy and then the one in 26F dropped a can of beer which rolled against my daughter's handbag. When she drew his attention to this they rounded on her giving her ""the finger"". I told them to be careful and they called me a ""rat"". The attendant came and asked them to calm down but it was having no effect. The ringleader appeared to be in 25F. He pressed the call button and told the attendant that I was annoying him by ""reading too loud"" he could ""hear my thoughts"". He looked at me and put his forked fingers to his eyes and then pointed them at me, in true Hollywood gangster style! I felt threatened and concerned for my family's well being. I was worried that they'd all come up to us at the baggage claim. As it happened the only thing was that 25F ran past and bumped into my arm on purpose. I feel the cabin crew allowed this situation to escalate. The entire rear of the plane had to put up with this childish behaviour for three hours. They even shouted at infants to 'Shush"". The staff should have threatened them with calling ahead to Cairns Airport Police to be waiting. This may have served to quieten them down.  Why can't Jetstar allow check-in earlier than 2 hours? I know I have done it with other airlines and it cuts down the queuing tremendously. Why don't Jetstar adopt a total weight luggage policy and show clearly if baggage drop is operational?

jetstar-airways,332419,2015-08-08,5,Canada,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"I flew HNL-SYD and a month later SYD-HNL. I was actually traveling from Vancouver to SYD, and broke up the trip by flying Air Canada YVR-HNL return for about $550, and the Jetstar for about $1100 (plus all the extras). I had to stay one night in HNL each way, adding $500 hotel. With the Jetstar extras the cost perhaps $500 less than a direct flight. Plus I was trying to break up the 15/16 hour nonstop flight duration.  Jetstar : I had a cordial reception checking in at HNL. The rest of the staff throughout the rest of the trip were indifferent. The Boeing 787 is a nice airplane, as they go. I paid extra for a good seat, which was a great boon on full flights. That was good value for money. I paid $40-ish for the meal: it was a rude joke both times. The meal was mushy, minimal and miserable, and you needed to wait 15 minutes for a drink to wash it down. The most demeaning part of the experience was getting dinged $125 for my 5 kilos overweight baggage on my return. There wasn't a weight scale where I was staying, so I couldn't have prepared myself for the problem. My carry-on backpack was at the carry-on weight limit, so I couldn't switch items into that. So it was either pay the money or toss out some of my clothes. I paid, and then fumed for the next hour or two. The only way Jetstar can avoid this kind of rude greeting for a customer would be to give staff some leeway on the overweight rule. But they were very stern. In most of the reviews people are willing to forgive Jetstar's faults because of the lower prices. I don't agree. A price is a price and a fault is a fault. If Jetstar worked on its faults, and upped its prices slightly, it could delight customers instead of annoying them, as it so often does. I think I'll flight direct next time, either Qantas or Air Canada.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SYD,HNL,,July 2015,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,4.0,no,3.0
jetstar-airways,330816,2015-08-02,3,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"Jetstar insist frequently enough during the online ticket purchase process that passengers must get to the airport 2 hours prior to departure which we dutifully did, arriving at Melbourne airport a bit before 4 am, to catch the 6:05 am jetstar flight to Sydney. When we arrived check in had just opened and there were only 2 staff checking baggage. Got our baggage tag and got in the queue. Then they proceeded to call out every single passenger whose flight were departing before ours, regardless of where they were in the queue. At one point the front line stood still for more than 49 minutes whilst jet star personnel were pulling people out of the other lanes and getting them checked in. When we finally got seen - after a riot nearly broke out - the check in guy told us we had less than 5 minutes to get through security and make our flight. We had to run like mad. Our flight was at 6:05 am!  I don't care about the pay per use for extra stuff like bags, food, seat assignments etc - it's a nuisance but fine. I'll pay, as long as I get the service. The lack of a coordinated path to check baggage for passengers and poor organization at the airport is simply not acceptable and no cheap airfare makes this worth the anxiety! It is maddening and made me angry and resentful. I can't believe this airline is a Qantas offshoot. In the end don't bother with the 2 hours early part. It does not make any difference trust me!! At least not for domestic flights departing Melbourne. Get there 45 minutes before your flight, flag a staff member and tell them your flight is boarding now and you'll get right up the front of the queue and wave bye bye to the poor sops who play by the rules. Basic definitions of service do not apply here and it is NOT first come first serve as they claim. It is next flight out gets first priority, which makes for a highly stressful experience.

Normally we would have taken an Air New Zealand flight, but flights all full and we had a time dealing to get to Wellington.

We get to Wellington and in a rush to make a function and in true Jetstar form, no bags arrive off the conveyor. After almost 20 minutes and about 40 plus customers all standing about awaiting bags, several customers like myself started making approaches to Jetstar. Apparently the machine that unloads luggage from the plane is broken and they didn't have another. Made worse because they were too cheap to hire one from Air NZ to get the plane unloaded. 50 minutes later customers were starting a small riot wanting to know what was going on. Jetstar never made any PA announcements, nor did they apologise when we finally got luggage 1.25 hours after the flight landed. They aren't a cheap airline to fly on anyway.

In row 2 of Business Class, I had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. There is an inherent design problem with JQ's configuration: Row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts Row 2 seats' access and space. When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms. The food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 Business Class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front.

Tired frustrated customers then had to be insulted by the Jetstar spokesman who simply kept reiterating that any costs involved in missed forward flights, accommodation etc were our fault if we had not taken out travel insurance – he likened it to hiring a car. I researched 5 different travel insurance providers and none would insure against an airline cancelling their own flight only against weather. Jetstar did not reply to my query as to whether our flight was cancelled due to engineering problems and if so why wasn’t another aircraft provided or due to an unfilled flight which several passengers had been told was the reason. Jetstar did offer $60 vouchers with an expiry date of 6 months – I asked if these could be transferred or extended as we did not intend to travel in that period and of course the response was no. The cancelled flight caused many passengers grief, in our case it set the stage for a nightmare 5 days of missed ongoing flights with huge rebooking fees (being Easter it was a nightmare getting seats on flights), missed hire car bookings, missed hotel and car hire, lost luggage meaning the same clothes for 5 days. Jetstar customer service responded that 'Section 9.1 of our Conditions of Carriage does state that flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us. This information is available on our website and you agree to it when you make your booking.' Jetstar is not a cheap airline, in fact there are times it is more expensive than Qantas and Virgin – we booked Jetstar because it fitted in with our dates.

We had seat 17E & 17D seats were comfortable. Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags. I have not come across this on a Jetstar flight in the past. Overall a very good flight and this is a very good low cost carrier. Would recommend to others but will warn them of these new changes.,,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,yes,4.0

Apart from Jetstar's normal rubbish administration (cancelled our original flight and seemed to think that putting us on a flight two days earlier should not even worth discussing) everything else was good. To put it in perspective - you get what you pay for. Sure we could have gone QANTAS or Hawaiian and had better seats but that would have been 3 times the price. We could have gone economy but I'm well over 6 feet and didn't fancy that. So it was a good compromise. It cost us around $1000 each one way (we were getting the ship back) The seats were pretty good (about Premium Economy level) the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent.

No priority baggage first off and last to get baggage. The all Thai cabin crew did not seem to have been well trained they were very friendly but the service was slow and haphazard. Some meals came out fast others really slow to arrive dessert of ice cream was liquid when it finally arrived.

As it was an evening flight we checked the Jetstar website throughout the day to ensure that our flight was not delayed before heading to the airport. On arrival at 3.30pm we were told the flight had been delayed until 4.00am. The reason was fog over Perth however we watched as other reputable airlines departed as scheduled. We were each given 'meal' vouchers which turned out to be to the value of approx. $7.15 - not enough to purchase a meal from any of the airport vendors. When we approached Jetstar for further compensation they did not provide any. We were forced to spend 12 hours waiting in Changi airport watching time pass. When the flight eventually did depart (after 4am following a long delay on the Tarmac) we were then brought the dinner meals that had been pre-purchased when we believed we would be flying out in the evening! Not being interested in eating dinner at 6.30am this was further money wasted.

Bought Jetstar tickets through Qantas as it was seemingly the only way to get sensible domestic connection from CBR. Price was nothing special. Bags were bang on 20kg if not a whisker over but a blind eye was shown which was a relief. They didn't weigh hand luggage at the gate. ADL-DPS sector was on a domestic A320 which was old dirty and the magazines in our seats were all torn. The seats were either developed by a bus builder or just stuffed judging by our numb behinds for the 5-hour flight. Crew fine and I gather ADL based. Disappointingly half the menu was unavailable as tragic as the choices are - they really aren't trying it really is lowest common denominator and undrinkable wine. DPS-MEL sector was on new B787 with Australian pilots but all Thai flight attendants. New Denpasar Airport is excellent very efficient even if the air con is a bit changeable. You can buy duty free (unlike other ports in Asia on flights to Aus?) which is bagged and given to you at the gate. First time on 787 and the big windows and nicer cabin humidity/pressure seemed to make a difference. I got a good sleep couldn't complain too much about seat or pitch.

I have to put my hand up and admit that my wife and I have only traveled with Jetstar once some years ago. From the outset (booking your tickets) the experience was horrendous with each separate step being asked if we wish to purchase an add on. And the number of times where we were reminded that carry on luggage that breached the weight limits (which apparently have recently been reduced) would be severely penalised and baggage placed in the hold. On our flight to Hobart passengers were called to board the aircraft then spent 20 minutes in a holding pen waiting to board. The flight left 20 minutes late. On our return journey from Hobart we arrived at the recommended 60 minutes before departure time to be told that the plane had been delayed and would be an hour late arriving which eventuality extended to two hours late arriving and departing.

The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes.

The trip over from Brisbane to Honolulu was ok but upon coming home I received an email at 11.42pm saying that our flight was delayed. After ringing them I was told that it would be leaving two days later at 12.45am. I was put up in the airport hotel and given USD 30.00 for meals. The following night I was given a note under my door saying to get to the airport at 12.00am so assumed again that our flight was delayed again. Yes it was it wasn't leaving until 3.00am! When ringing Jetstar and going onto their website I was told that it was still leaving at 12.45am and again the website said that as well. Many frustrated and angry customers we all proceeded to the airport. No one at Jetstar knew what was going on and after waiting for over an hour a non Jetstar customer service lady proceeded to tell us that it wasn't leaving until 3.00am.

Amazingly for such a new plane we were not the only one on the flight with this problem. The way JetStar have designed their entertainment unit is if it's unresponsive like ours were not only do you not get video but you cannot turn on the overhead light or call an attendant. It's all integrated in with each other. Due to the Dreamliner windows automatically shading out while mid flight we had to sit there in the dark with no entertainment or reading.

jetstar-airways,256466,2015-02-24,2,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"Sydney to Honolulu (Business Class) on 10 February 2015. The moment I got into my seat I was taken down ""memory lane"" of the 1990's. The seat of Jetstar's Business Class was exactly the same seat taken when you're flying Business Class in the 1990's. The only thing that was added were the two in-seat power points. Makes me suspect that Jetstar/Qantas cut corners by re-using the old Business Class seats from old airframes and installed them here. Like the old Business Class seats the in-flight entertainment (IFE) is a very bulky iPad with equally bulky battery pack. The first meal dinner I was given a choice of two dishes. After dinner I ordered for black coffee 15 minutes later my ordered arrived as coffee with milk/coffee. I ordered Scotch after dinner and it arrived 20 minutes later as Scotch and soda. For breakfast I was given two choices: Take it or leave it. This is where Jetstar cuts costs again. Instead of hot meal you're given a bowl of cereals. The seats were hard and I didn't sleep a wink because it was just plain difficult to lean back. Personally I wouldn't recommend anyone to bother buying Business Class as it is really not worth it. I have flown Business Class (Cathay Pacific) and Premium Economy (Air New Zealand) and Jetstar's Business Class is BELOW (in standard) compared to Air New Zealand's Premium Economy.

We were lucky to get seats on the 12.45am flight however the seats at the very back of the plane ""designated for cabin crew."" Because this is a budget airline we really didn't expect many thrills but the back seats allow for little room to recline and the three seats in a row are so compact it was the most uncomfortable experience I've had on a plane.

Jetstar have managed to take such an advanced and modern aircraft and jam it with cramped seats down in economy with terrible leg room. I am not even that big 175cm. It looks like they had a team from Tupperware design and install the entire interior of this plane. Plastic everywhere. The food (pre-purchased) was marginal at best and it'll cost you $10 to watch a movie. You go to all that trouble of installing screens in the back of the seat and it seemed hardly anyone bothered paying. The actual inflight experience (bigger windows air quality and smooth flight) was OK - and I am looking forward to flying the 787 again with an airline that actually designed a cabin with a hint of passenger comfort in mind.

I chose business class and left the flight feeling that the customer care food and cabin comfort was good. The food which was better than previous flights. My return flight JQ23 from MEL to Tokyo NRT - a very disappointing experience in 20 years of business travel. Check-in was the best customer handling that I had experienced with Jetstar. Two hours later at the gate the boarding process was mismanaged and turned into a stampede of economy and business class passengers jostling for access at the same time. Staff were flustered and lost control. The cabin crew communication customer handling and courtesy was very good. I appreciated their efforts and acknowledge that Jetstar standards has improved. The worst Business Class meal - 3 choices chicken and noodle pea and cheese soup or Hamburger ""raked"" sliced pork. The meal arrived - the hamburger was a dry reheated toasted sandwich with two pickles and mustard. Not a hamburger. One thin slice of pork between soggy reheated toast and pickles. This was not an optional snack this was the main course standard for business class. It gets worse the desert was two shortbread cookies and no tea or coffee. The breakfast was good with fruit yoghurt juice. I requested tea which was cold. I hadn't realised that Jetstar had included an inflatable neck cushion in the the comfort pack - a thoughtful and beneficial improvement however when I tried to brush my teeth before landing the tooth paste was missing and there was no paper cups in the toilet. These basic products are important. I can't brush my teeth so the comfort pack became ineffective. Jetstar is a budget airline it is not Singapore Airlines so fair assessment is needed considering value-for-money. Jetstar has made many improvements with cabin crew and ground staff customer handling skills. As I confirmed in my flight ex-Japan Jetstar can provide good food that meets business class expectations. However the toasted sandwich and cookies main course has me questioning whether my next flight to Australia in August should be with another airline.

jetstar-airways,256495,2014-11-25,1,United Kingdom,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Flew between Sydney and Uluru. The flights themselves were what you would expect from a budget airline. The check-in process however was a total shambles. At Sydney Airport there was just one long line for all their departures. Using the automated check-in machines was a waste of time - when we eventually reached the check-in desk the baggage tags we'd carefully put on were unceremoniously ripped off. We were still in the middle of the long line having arrived two hours before our scheduled departure time when we heard someone shouting our flight number. With great difficulty we managed to extricate ourselves and baggage from 'the maze'. Eventually we found the check-in desk where our flight number was being shouted. The check-in clerks were complaining to each other that they weren't being sent the right passengers. The return flight from Uluru wasn't much better despite being the only departure that afternoon. At the check-in they waited until all the passengers arrived before they very slowly began the process. Very galling to watch them sitting behind the check-in desks doing nothing while we all stood in line. Even when they did condescend to start work they seemed to believe that chatting between themselves was a higher priority than dealing with their customers. Value for money? I would want to be paid to experience that again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,no,1.0

I had just driven to Brisbane as Qantas do not go to the Sunshine Coast. When I arrived at Jetstar there was just one girl attending to the baggage drop. I was eventually given my boarding pass and allocated seat 17. The Jetstar representative checking the cabin luggage was very officious. I lined up and the representative said to weigh my handbag computer and fascinator for the Cup the fascinator weighed nothing the total weight was well under 10kgs. The fascinator was damaged during this process. I asked if I could just carry the fascinator on board then she said you can only have 2 bags. I said the hat weighs nothing though. She said well put the hat on your head! I then boarded the plane and by the time the food arrived the air hostess said there was nothing left and I had to go without a decent lunch. Prior to boarding the plane there were four people near me who swore they would not fly with Jetstar again.

Business class with a discount airline is of course really the equivalent of premium economy with a full service airline.

My husband had a fixed metal box between his feet Seat 2G and had to sit at an angle to stretch his legs. The footrest was of no value whatsoever. The so called 'touch' screen required a hard tap to operate and I felt every selection the passenger behind me made. He also had long legs and therefore I couldn't recline my seat as far as I wanted. The flight departed at 10.30pm and was scheduled to take just over 5 hrs. The first hour of the flight was taken up with Business Class passengers eating their 'free' meal. The small window of opportunity to sleep was reduced. The toilet was Out of Order from the start of the flight. We fly Economy Jetstar regularly and have low expectations high satisfaction.

Each flight left and arrived on time. The staff were efficient and friendly. We pre ordered vegetarian meals and they were excellent in fact some of the best airline food we have had. There is no inflight entertainment as advertised so we took our own iPads loaded with books and movies. We only had carry on luggage and although it complied with weight restrictions no one checked the size and weight. The seat pockets needed a good clean out as I found on both trips but the cabin and bathrooms were kept clean throughout the trip. The distance to the seat in front was a little squishy when the couple in front threw their seats back for the the return trip. This would be a problem if you are large. But I've had the problem on higher priced full serviced flights so it comes down to the courtesy of your fellow travellers. To date we have taken about 10 Jetstar flights and never a problem.

jetstar-airways,256503,2014-10-28,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Melbourne to Honolulu - we chose to fly Jetstar as it is the only airline that flies to Honolulu direct from Melbourne. It markets itself as a low cost no frills airline. It was certainly no frills but definitely not low cost. We flew the week before September school holidays and the airfares were very expensive. Overall I would describe the experience as mediocre. We were in economy and walking through business class I would not pay the extra for what looked like a sub par business class offering. The seats were okay but what you would expect on a domestic flight not a long haul international flight. It was a night flight so people were wanting to try and sleep. In the row behind us were four off duty Qantas flight attendants who proceeded to drink to excess talk extremely loudly and swear constantly disturbing other passengers for at least four hours. The flight attendants on our flight took about 5 hours to finally tell them to quieten down. I was astounded that they thought it was okay to disturb other passengers for hours on end. Appalling behaviour that should have been pulled up sooner. Inflight entertainment is non existent on back of seats which is ridiculous. You can rent Ipads for $18 which were woeful. The limited range of movies seemed to be geared towards the male audience. Even the lifestyle section was a selection of cars and music shows. They really need to take a good look at this very limited and poor offering. We heard many fellow passengers complaining about the Ipad content also. Food was either pre booked and very expensive meals or snacks you could buy on board. Take your own food on board would be my advice. It would have been good to see more gluten free offerings rather than a cookie. Service was basic not particularly friendly and mostly absent.

As a normal Qantas traveller and having not travelled on Jetstar for 8 years I was pleasantly surprised of how good the service was. The flight itself was full and boarded late. Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas.

jetstar-airways,256505,2014-10-22,,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,My family of three traveled from Manila to Sydney. We were delayed 2 days in Manila and were not informed when our flight will be until the last minute. They put us up in a very nice hotel in Manila while we were waiting. The morning of the flight they decided to take everyone to the airport at least 3 hours before the flight. I guess they were going for the Guinness book of records for the longest queue ever. Because they didn't start checking people in until all the bus loads had arrived. Little did I know this was a sign of what was to come. We had to change at Darwin to a connecting domestic flight where we arrived about 1pm. As our connecting flight was not there yet they put us up in a hotel in Darwin. We had to wait in a queue in Darwin 3 hours for our new tickets. That plus the 2.5 hours we had to wait in Manila plus an hour at the hotel. All this waiting in queues with a 12 month old infant. The flight from Darwin to Sydney left about 2am. A family we made friends with while waiting in the queue suffered worse than us. They were put off the plane at Darwin because their baby had eczema around it's mouth. Wasn't the whole family just the father and 3 kids. Mother was waiting for them in Sydney. The pilot said the family was removed because the child had an obvious illness. I witnessed the whole event and the pilot never left the cockpit. Anyone that has had a child with eczema would have known what it was. so anyway the family was taken off the plane and left on the bridge. One of the flight attendants coldly carried the sleeping girl and dumped her on the bridge. A memorably bad experience. If you have a family don't fly Jetstar.

jetstar-airways,256506,2014-10-22,2,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,HNL-SYD and HBA-SYD return. First of all our flight from Hobart was delayed by nearly 2 hours. When we arrived in Sydney were told that no luggage had been loaded. It was very windy in Hobart so I get why this happened but we were off to Hawaii. Had we been given notice before checking in the luggage that this was a possibility we could have got our swimmers out and left the big bag in Hobart. Anyway Jetstar managed to give us about 3 different stories about when our luggage would arrive in Hawaii and each was completely contradictory. I spent perhaps 3 hours in the first couple of days trying to chase down what was going on. On the HNL SYD flight the attendants all seemed to be lovely but were absolutely hopeless. They were disorganised we didn't get a veg meal that we had ordered. The cabin was an absolute pigsty too - there was an overwhelming smell of urine there were coffee drips on my tray table milk spilt over the seat a carton of milk shoved down the side of the seat previous passengers' rubbish in the seatback compartment. I took my daughter to the toilet about 10 minutes after the seatbelt sign had been switched off and there was urine on the floor. We got back to SYD late and we missed our connecting flight. I had tried twice before leaving HNL to check in online it wouldn't let me. Tried again before going through customs wouldn't let me. I then called once we had got though customs talked to someone who told me she should be able to get it done. I asked her if she could let me know the quickest way to get to domestic and she said she could then put me on hold. Very long story short I ended up on the phone to her for 38 minutes got to check in 29 minutes before takeoff and was not allowed on the plane. I have travelled with Jetstar many times and at this stage the bad experiences outnumber the good about 3-1. Last time on a flight from HBA to MLB I organised (booked and paid for) transport via Jetstar and ended up at the airport with the company having no record of it and refusing to pick me up. The thing that I think frustrates me the most is that through all this it has been me who has had to chase everything up.

Flew round trip from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The departure was fine nothing too major besides the language barrier. The return trip-was hell. I arrived at the airport and checked into the terminal at 1pm for a 2:30 flight. At 2 pm the notification was released that this flight and only this flight was to be postponed for 3 hours due to weather that was scheduled to arrive later that night. Why would you delay a flight so that it departs when weather turns bad vs while it's nice and sunny? I went to the ticket counter to enquire about being moved to the next available flight out and of course the next flights to my destination are on time and full. Great. So now my 2.30 departure is now a 5pm departure while all other airlines are on schedule. he attendant says I am more than welcome to book an earlier fight with a different carrier and will be refunded part of my trip - I was 'credited' 92USD not even close to half of the cost of the total trip but it was a refund. I proceed to a different carrier and walk away at the $430 one way option and sadly go back the original carrier after the prices were higher at each different carrier. I purchased the only flight to my destination for $115 - the only open and next available flight. I paid for the same seat twice. I have a seat on a plane that once again is delayed.

jetstar-airways,256513,2014-10-12,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary.

All passengers had to disembark retrace their steps through immigration and pick up their luggage - again fair enough I suppose. But then the whole planeload of passengers was left milling around trying to find out what was going to happen from a couple of harassed young Japanese Jetstar employees with limited English who were doing their level best in the face of increasingly bewildered and irritated passengers. After an hour or so news filtered through that there would be another flight late the following day. Eventually someone must have found the key to the room where the public address microphone is but no accommodation arranged or suggested and a couple of hundred people with all their bags simply left to their own devices in a deserted terminal in the middle of the night. Delays happen of course they do but you need a contingency plan for occasions such as these - and invest in a bullhorn for heavens sake so that you can keep people informed.

To be fair not all of the seats were broken mine reclined on the left side thereby putting my left shoulder on the lap of the person behind me while my right shoulder was touching the back of the seat in front of me.

The inflight crew on the outbound flight were mostly foreign and very professional and friendly. Food service was OK. On the return flight the food was inedible. The aircraft operating this service is the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The only dream we had was to be able to get out of our seats. Once the seats in front were reclined it was impossible to get out. The recline came back to the level of the armrest preventing one to stand up. The only way to exit the seat is to swing ones legs over the armrest into the aisle. If sitting in the centre of three one has to be dragged out.,,,Business Class,,,,,0.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,no,2.0

At Narita Airport the staff were friendly I would expect nothing less in Japan. Australia is where the drop in service is found. The first few flights were fine. Staff seemed a bit unfriendly. Melbourne was a whole other story. Ticket counter staff: The staff were chatting with each other and did not notice me standing in the economy line. The girl took my passport without a greeting and continued talking to her co-worker. In a condescending tone said ""You know this flight is 2 hours late right?"" Never an apology for the inconvenience. I was given my ticket with no explanation about where the gates were or how to handle this delay. I decided to wait at the gate and get information there. The 11pm flight now said 1.30 departure with ""Closed"" next to it. I had no idea what this meant and other customers seemed confused as well. My ticket said 12.30 boarding in pen so I just waited. At 12.45 a gate staff member came to the gate but made no announcements. At 12.50 we find out they will start boarding at 110 once the plane has been deplaned. Boarding: The female gate attendant at least said thank you to each customer the male said nothing. Just scanned all of the boarding passes like a robot. I was surprised they never checked our passports even though it was an international flight. Flight: The flight had about 100 people. The airplane could probably hold about 340 people. Still all the customers were assigned seats right next to each other. The flight crew announced that ""You may notice how empty the flight is. Please wait until we are in the air to choose new seats."" Once we were on the plane the pilot needed to get the weights and the flight crew needed to remember where meal customers were seated so they prohibited seat changing. Very poor customer service by airport staff! Flight: The seats were actually very comfortable. My intention was to sleep through the flight. Unfortunately my ticket said meal on it unbeknownst to me so 2 hours into my sleep the flight attendant jabbed my arm to wake me up and give me the food. Her exact words? ""You ordered the meal."" As we were landing the flight crew (not the pilot) made an announcement to thank us for flying and finally apologized for the delayed time. All in all - not the best experience. The food was good. The IPAD rental is ridiculously expensive and from what I heard doesn't offer a lot of selection. The flight attendants seems rushed or irritated when they did their jobs.

We could not check in until 6pm. The least Jetstar can offer is some bottled water and increase the meal voucher which is less than Aus$10.

Cruising: Drink served and soon the meal which was pretty good appeared. Cheese and wafers and fruit and a glass of lovely Rutherglen muscadelle were great. Inflight service: Once ""service"" is over staff become very scarce and those who are about do not overtly seek eye contact. However a walk into the galley is greeted warmly and efficiently for any small request. Inflight crew: The captain and second were good on announcements and I look forward to having them up front again. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous but you felt that was the extent of the service offering. I was sitting next to an off duty staff member and was not greeted with a hello or any form of inquiry as to my flight for the duration of the flight. I suppose that is what separates the great airlines from the good airlines? If you love your product or just go to work is demonstrated by behaviours not platitudes of company jingles. Overall: Great plane and cabin and faultless service for most part.

I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner.

jetstar-airways,256560,2014-06-16,7,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,12 June 2014. JQ 30 BKK-MEL. Business seat 1 F Boeing 787-8. First flight on a 787 and booked my normal 1F. At check in advised it was one 1 E. Due to language difficulties I could not understand why and my request for an explanation was polite but I was not able to master the meaning. I was informed it was a window seat so proceeded to the aircraft. I was then advised that I was in the second row. The reason I fly in row one is for the legroom and lack of a seat in my face for 9 hours making laptop use at times impossible. Again the explanation was difficult to understand and upon my insistence I eventually got back into 1F. It appears the IFE was U/S in seat 1F and the crew were trying to assist me. Lived without IFE. Food and service very good from an all Thai crew which is becoming the norm on this leg and JQ 29. Big drawback with the 787 in seat 1F is that the galley access is out of alignment with the seat so approximately one foot of the space in front of the seat is in line with the open galley. This means when the crew make their multiple visits the curtain hits the passengers legs. This could be some what alleviated with a retainer lower down the curtain. So for 787 flights I advise I will be sitting in 1B or 1J which are out of the way of the traffic flow by about 4 inches. The seats were reasonably comfortable with reasonable recline but footrests need improving as the rung like support is intrusive. Plane new and clean as you would expect. PA from flight deck was nearly indecipherable. This is a safety issue that needs attending to. The headset issued now has a 3 pin plug and subjectively the headsets don't seem as noise cancelling as the ones on the A330. A pity my Bose were in checked luggage as the 3 pin plug would not worth the headset with my phone or Ipad so no IFE and no music. Not the end of the world but an opportunity for better communication with customers one would have thought.,,,Business Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,1.0

I purchased their max. checked baggage allowance of 40Kg (wouldn't let me buy more) although I thought she might be slightly over since basically every other airline allows two fifty lb bags to be checked they cap it at two 44 lb bags. She was 4 kg total over at check in and they told her she would need to pay $25 per kg. I told her to start dumping things in front of the check in desk. She was on a half full flight and 4kg was going to matter? They also weigh purses as part of this luggage scam because you are only allowed 10kg carried on.

jetstar-airways,256569,2014-05-17,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Ballina-Melbourne on A320. Paid about $100 or so for a one way ticket which I purchased on Qantas website . Baggage allowance was 20kg and there was no detail on the QF website about incremental charges for excess baggage. Travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg - ie: 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. Jetstar charged me $300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. Qantas should be reprimanded for selling Jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and Jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesn't remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. Qantas customer service people in Melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a Jetstar issue (even though JQ is owned by QF and the ticket was bought on the QF website). Jetstar employees in Melbourne were unsympathetic said I should've known read the policies etc. One even suggested they should be charging more and didn't think $500-1000 was out of line.

jetstar-airways,256573,2014-05-08,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,My wife 3 children and I flew from Honolulu to Melbourne just under an 11 hour flight. No mention of needing to pre-book ipads. The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers?

It cost my group members over $800 each to fly from Singapore to Hangzhou when tickets on full-fledge flights with meals refreshments and entertainment on other airlines like SIA and Cathay Pacific can cost less. It's 'budget' quality in seats with very narrow leg space so the flight attendants insisted that all hand carry had to be stored in the overhead compartments. Problem is that all the compartments near our seats were full with the crew's and other passengers luggage. There didn't seem to be restrictions on the size and the number of hand-carry passengers could bring on the plane. A crew member offered to squeeze my backpack into a compartment that was far from my seat. As I had my passport and money in it it refused to have it out of my sight.

I had read online that these were the best seats with more recline what's the point of having them if they are only for crew - seems pointless! Seat config of 2-3-2.

Dinner was ok - Soup for starter which was tasteless Main was very tasty which was stir fry steak. Was accompanied with a 'salad' which was a couple of lettuce leaves in a bowl. Wine choice good. Entertainment system ok - had a couple of new release movies and some recent TV shows but quite limited. Overall it was good value for money but I'd hardly call this Business Class.

jetstar-airways,256596,2014-02-24,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Travelled for the first time with Jetstar in January to Launceston. Check in took 50 minutes at Sydney (just as well we were early). When on the plane I had to sit sideways as there was not enough leg room my teenage sons also had the same problem. The lady in front of me tried to recline her seat during the flight but could not because my knee was jammed up against the back of her seat. I had to ask her to stop trying to recline as it was hurting my knees. I Think Jetstar are greedy as they are understaffed and there are too many rows of seats on the plane for people of average size. Next holiday it will be back to Virgin.,,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,4.0,0.0,,,2.0,no,1.0
jetstar-airways,256597,2014-02-21,5,Japan,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Jetstar is a low-cost carrier but still they could do a little better in some specific areas to avoid disappointing their customers. For example: I was flying 3K764 KIX-MNL and they offer online check in. But when you get to the airport the special line for online checked in passengers is closed and you have to queue with the regular passengers. The local Jetstar staff doesn't seem to understand the concept of on-line check in and frequent travelers would agree with me that it's quite annoying.

No IFE and food and drink prices were reasonable. I had a coffee which was surprisingly good. The bugbear was the check in. Massive queues at Sydney but moving quickly due to the fully manned bag drops. However in Melbourne for the return two ""jobsworths"" asked where passengers were travelling to and only allowed certain flights to join the queue. Consequently when they did finally condescend to allow us in it was an almighty scramble to get the bag dropped and to the gate before the flight. Really let the airline sown.

We had carry on only and we used web check in so we could go straight to the gate no queuing or anything. Flight was on time and aircraft was clean. Seat was adequately comfortable however the legroom was limited it would be a bit uncomfortable on a longer flight. Crew were especially good on this flight very welcoming and helpful. Didn't purchase any food onboard or entertainment onboard - no need to spend the extra $$ on a short flight. Arrived early. JQ793 - 18th Jan 2014. Aircraft A320 VH-VQQ. Seat: 28F. Flight was good seat pretty comfortable more legroom on this older and differently configured aircraft. Once again didn't purchase any food or entertainment. Crew were helpful. Arrived on time. Overall I was very pleased with the service. We just wanted the cheapest fare so we don't care about extras like luggage entertainment food.

Check in manager very rude even after I produced my ASIC and advised her that I was fully aware of the conditions of being in an exit row. Inexcusable behaviour. Flight was out on time on a new A320 but I cannot understand the cabin crew. A person should not do a job like this if they are not cut out to do it. Sure the flight was a ""red eye"" and as a frequent flyer I can accept that this can affect your moods. But the fact that one staff member (Cabin Manager) was putting meals on the floor another male member of staff (who conveniently wore no name tag) was slamming around and making as much noise as he possibly could. He was on a mission not to let passengers sleep. And then the lot of them standing there and complaining about their jobs - well you get the picture. Paid a full fare for this flight and in my view if this is the way Jetstar operates their business they do not deserve any of the domestic market.

I tried to buy drinks on the plane and staff rudely informed me that they don't take cash (AUD or JPY) and only credit cards which I didn't have. To be fair the flight was a lot cheaper than any of the other full service airlines but you get what you pay for. Flew back to Tokyo on Air NZ a few weeks later and was amazed at the difference. Chalk and cheese. Seats are uncomfortable and have minimum legroom (even on a large aircraft such as the A330). Cabin crew are rude (and their polyester polo shirt uniforms are awful). Check in staff appear to be overworked.

Personally I found the seats in economy class quite OK compared to the economy seats on Qantas and Virgin who use Boeing 737's. Being a low cost carrier I made sure I read the fine print and terms and conditions. Once again as is so true in life you get what you pay for. Budget Airline means no frills and the bare basics unless you want to pay extra. As it is only a 3.5 hour flight I was more than happy to forgo the full services offered in exchange for a much cheaper fare. Both times Jetstar have provided a realistic service for the price paid. Aircraft was clean flight on time and fairly smooth. No real complaints. What I expected was met and I would much rather have the money I saved to spend on my holiday than enjoying all the perks of a full service carrier. Realistically it is only 3.5 hours out of your life! Will happily fly Jetstar again in the future on short haul flights.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,yes,0.0

Though the return flight from Osaka was average. They forgot my sons meal during dinner service (I had to ask them for it) they did apologise though he ordered chicken and got beef and I said nothing as I figured it was all to much trouble for them. Then the girl going through the cabin offering desert tea and coffee missed us completely. Once again I had to ask. The fight from Cairns started good with a very helpful girl at the counter. Some of the crew were terrible. Then a rather rude women on the crew ordering people to sit down marching up and down the plane and the two crew members sitting down the back during the whole trip gossiping in loud voices. As an Australian it was embarrassing. As a regular flyer I've got to say the service is pretty average and it really is hit or miss. Some staff members are very good while some are woeful.

They appear to be over-anticipating passenger demand on some routes and when supply outstrips demand simply cancelling flights and disrupting passengers by either flying them the next day or transferring them to flights to other airports on sister airlines and bussing passengers to their original destination.

More often than not you hear of overbooked passengers from Qantas being transferred to a Jetstar flight but you are never offered a seat on a Qantas flight if you booked through Jetstar and there is a delay.

Booked our seats about 10 days before travel ($10 fee) and got a printout. Made the mistake of not checking in when we arrived thinking the seat booking was sufficient. So after waiting 2.5 hours to board we discovered that we did need boarding cards. The supervisor then told us it was too late numbers/names had gone to the Captain and there was nothing he could do - catch the next flight in the morning. Where do we stay? Shrug. Sent us to the Jetstar desk to register for the flight and we were told we had to pay $150 late booking fee! Asked the supervisor if he could waive the fee as we had no choice but to book late. ""No can't do that."" Airport closing soon - see you later. No attempt to help or suggest any > accommodation or anything. Found some nice people who helped us find a hotel close by - $189: not much sleep. My question is: why if we've booked and the supervisor goes through the list to make up a manifest can they not make an announcement to check if people who've booked and paid for seats are in the transit lounge?

Both flights were extremely delayed and the flight crew were not helpful. Bags were moved by the flight crew and they did not inform the passengers. It took over 35 minutes to board the plane.

In our experience Jetstar is not as good as it used to be. Attitudes of airline staff are pretty dodgy with only one air steward on our recent flight seeming at all interested in passengers. It is a budget airline but the cleanliness of the cabin should not be compromised. Chewing gum was stuck to the seat in front of me windows were covered in finger prints which indicated a child had sat in the seat on the previous flight and the toilets at the front of the plane were not clean to begin with so were quite revolting by the end of the 6hr flight. To top it off the young couple in the seats directly in front of us reclined their seats as far back as possible so neither my hubby nor I could move his knees were literally squished into the back of the seat. When we asked the air steward to request they pop their seats forward slightly so we could at least move our legs the response was very cool but they eventually acquiesced.

When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient. Despite the aircraft being on the ground for a good 35 minutes most of the windows were grubby. The flight was fine and I had about 2cm between my knees and the seat in front.

Bear in mind that this is a low cost airline and meals etc are only provided to those who are prepared to pay at the time of serving. I took a good look at the number of passengers who did purchase meals and there were not many therefore the serving times should have been a lot faster than they were. In between serving the crew made no attempt to contain their noise coming from the galley. Probably the most disruptive flight I have been on and for a change it was not the passengers who were the cause. Perhaps a review of the serving processes is required to help speed this up.

jetstar-airways,256716,2013-01-15,8,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,MEL-SIN return. We chose not to pay extra for mileage credits. We sought legroom and we got it. The seat width was suitable. We needed a wheelchair and ‘pusher’ at all travel terminal areas as they had slopes difficult joining lips & pushing distances beyond what I am capable of doing. Jetstar assisted with a wheelchair on the outward leg. Only after much discussion did we get 'pusher' assistance on arrival in Singapore. When this came it was an excellent 'local service' - a gratuity was not begrudged. For frequent travellers being a continuing Qantas Club member as I am was wise. In Singapore they arranged the 'pusher' service to our return gate. Sadly at both check-ins knowledge by Jetstar staff about Business Class Max rights plus those of Qantas Club Members was either nil or misinformed. It was a bad start later righted by Qantas Club Staff at both lounges. The in light food choices were acceptable. No problems with the complimentary liquor nor level of service table decor or travel amenities supplied. Seat back lowering by the person in front was a concern on both flights as we had to disturb those persons when we wished to move about. Our outward seats were in Row 6 – the last in Business Class with restricted but acceptable lowering for a day flight not suitable if overnight. The Jetstar web-site would not let me pre-select a seat if you had asked for ‘wheelchair assistance’ as we had - it was one or the other and this is unsatisfactory. On return I opted to select Row 4 to fully recline. In this position the seat is not a fully reclining ‘sleeper’- footrest space is insufficient. With a 2-3-2 configuration in this cabin I would not choose the middle seat of a fully occupied ‘3’. We were fortunate both ways in not having a full cabin thus no problem with overhead storage but a number of the compartments were taken up with staff bags and service items-not good. Ours were Jetstar stop-over flights in Singapore as part of flying to/from China thus and correctly there were helpful Chinese & English speaking flight attendants however the level of English could have been better. In reading some of the adverse comments about Jetstar Business the benefits provided compared to cost is being ignored. It is a precious approach to compare Jetstar to a 'full service' airline.

During the delay the flight attendants were not any good as they had put them self in the galley and only came down with a small drink of water which wasn't that nice. The captain was much helpful with information during the delay. After take-off in flight entertainment started but not for long. Didn't have any food or drink as I was sick during the flight except water during the delay. Would recommend it if your looking for the cheapest way possible but at the same time wouldn't recommend it. I would personally keep to domestic with Jetstar.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,no,2.0
jetstar-airways,256374,2012-11-26,3,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Frustrating trip to Launceston flying Jetstar. Remember to book any checked in luggage more than 24 hours before your flight and if you get an error message that says you are not eligible to book call their service centre to resolve (which we should have done) as baggage charges increase significantly if you buy baggage allowance at the airport. We also arrived to the airport with ample time to spare but waited 30 mins in a service queue to sort baggage which caused us then to be late for flight.

Check in was efficient and flights on time both ways. IFE was the only let down. Very limited range of movies and even though we flew over in Oct and back in Nov we had Nov choices both ways so 20 hrs with only 2 movies I wanted to see out of the limited selection. We didn't buy food but took our own on the plane and this was no problem. Checking in baggage is not inexpensive but if you do it at time of booking it is not too bad.

Flight to Narita was 9.5 hrs from Gold Coast and add around 1.5 hrs from Sydney to Gold Coast but still being a very large plane and only around 50 or so people on board you can take advantage of the 4 seaters. I have learnt that you don't have to book seats on these flights and pay an extra $25 for it better to use that money to add check baggage to your flight and checked baggage isn't really cheap at $45 for 15kg.

There is so little room between the rows that when the passenger in front has his seat reclined it is almost impossible to leave your seat! On a short daytime flight perhaps but on an overnight flight sleep is impossible. The food was however quite good and the alcohol service OK but nothing makes up for uncomfortable seating or the lack of pillows (unbelievable even though they provide a blow-up neck support). They also don't offer the normal express service through immigration etc and no priority baggage handling which is quite annoying.

You can choose from the entire for sale menu from the economy cabin at any time which gives you access to a much wider selection of mid flight snacks than could be offered on a full service airline.

jetstar-airways,256401,2012-10-11,8,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,My partner and I fly with Jetstar regularly choosing them over Qantas because economy seats are more comfortable and the crew generally more friendly attentive and genuine. We are Qantas Club members (corporate) and only have one real complaint about Jetstar. We are able to access the Qantas Club lounge but cannot use the Qantas Club check in facilities. The queues at Melbourne and Sydney terminal 2 are notoriously long and while we all stand there waiting with people stressing and Jetstar staff running up and down the line calling passengers to counters for 'called flights' the adjacent Qantas check in counters (especially the dedicated Qantas Club ones) are empty with staff having lovely personal chats. Why doesn't Qantas Group either use these under utilised counters and check Qantas Club members in or create a dedicated Jetstar queue for these premium passengers instead of constantly annoying us by making us wait for ages. Surely it wouldn't cost too much to implement and would be a fantastic customer service to an already pretty good airline. Just because it's a 'low cost' doesn't mean premium passengers should be treated in a low cost fashion. Also I thought 'leisure airline' was the preferred term for Jetstar - perception is very powerful. Tiger is 'low cost'.,,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,4.0

We went to the gate and found other people some of whom had received text messages saying that the flight was delayed until 14.45 or 4.45.

Then we were given - reluctantly - $10 vouchers to keep us fed and watered for the next 5.5 hours. Had we been told this at check-in we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. Jetstar don't allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. When we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldn't be delayed!

I took my 86 year old mother for a family holiday. Because she is frail I am 190 cm tall and my wife needs to care for my 8 year old son we delayed our holiday for several days in order to secure the 3 aisle seats we needed. Can you imagine the humiliation I suffered in front of my mother and other passengers when after we had taken our seats the ground staff came into the cabin and demanded I move to a middle seat or else the plane's takeoff would be delayed. In order to avoid a fuss my mother agreed to move to the middle seat. However as soon as the meal service ended the passenger who demanded my aisle seat fully reclined the two seats in front of my mother so his 3yr old and 6 yr old daughters could relax. Because the armrests on the StarClass seats are fixed in position mum was trapped in her seat until the next meal service 7 hours later! To be fair the aircrew were great and handled this unpleasant situation very well. I do not understand how an airline can advertise that you can pay for seat allocation and then not honour the terms of their contract.

Unfortunately because of the limited number of StarClass seats on these long haul flights we were unable to fly StarClass on the return leg or rent an ipad to entertain my son because they only load 47 units on long haul flights from Honolulu even during school holidays.,,,,,,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,no,2.0

With all the add ons it was no longer ""low fare"". Value was non-existent. We had to take the bus at the terminal to the far end of the airport. Since many people don't want to pay for checked-in luggage overhead bins overflowed. By the time we got into the cabin it was past the time for taking off.

We selected Jetstar as Hawaiian and Qantas both use 767's versus the A330 Jetstar operates. No airline offers full flat bed seats so it made sense. Maybe Jetstar changed from Star class to business as they were not able to make us feel like stars. The all leather seats give you no support no pillows are provided all you get is a DIY blow up neck ring. The crew was running through the cabin with the attempt to avoid any eye contact with passengers. Coming back we had a great crew a vastly improved experience which made the poor seating and lack of room not as bad after all. For extra comfort we purchased our own pillows and did not bother blowing up the neck ring! Departure and arrival times where spot on.

Jetstar insist that their own international passengers claim their bags at Sydney domestic and then carry them across to International although they will check bags through for American Airlines passengers! In fact nowhere on the ticket is it mentioned that passengers have to make their own way from the domestic terminal in Sydney to the international - either a bus or a train fare away. The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid. I would suggest that elderly passengers in particular stay away from Jetstar International if their flight involves a domestic connection because Jetstar will require them to claim their own luggage and check in again at the connection point.,,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,no,0.0

On 11th June we returned from Phuket to Sydney once again in business class. I have to say the food provided on this flight was very disappointing. Very little difference to what companions were given in economy class. Bland tasteless muck. We did have metal cutlery! Once the meal was served the attendants seamed to disappear and even getting a fresh bottled water was a chore. I'm not convinced the extra cost over economy is actually good value. The seats are comfortable if you're above average height and you do get off the flight first upon arrival making it quicker at immigration. overall though I think they need to lift their game.

But you must check in at least 1/2 hr before - no exceptions - or then you lose your ticket. This means check-in counter staff are idle until each flight opens - then bombarded - by the people who are all waiting just outside the check in queue anyway. They usually don't use air- bridges so you have to walk in the weather across the tarmac. You kind of expect that on a little Dash-8 at a regional airport - but not on a big jet in a capital city. As per Jetstar website seat pitch on the A320 is 28"" - not 30"". All other Aussie airlines have 30-33"". That makes a big difference on a 5.2hr flight BNE-PER. Seats only recline about 4 degrees back as a result. You can't even get a drink of water for less than $3.50. No room in overhead lockers because they're full of carry-on luggage from those who won't pay $18 for checked luggage - but will happily pay for numerous $7 bourbons en-route. You can't move to spare seats because they are sold to someone. The worst aspect: You can't check your bags through on multiple domestic flights (only on some international). You have to get your bags after each flight and then re-check for the next flight and re-clear security. A pain when there's 5 hrs between flights (remember - can't check in until 2hrs before) but worse if your flights are close & first flight is late.

After meal was served crew were scarce and spent time gossiping in galley.
