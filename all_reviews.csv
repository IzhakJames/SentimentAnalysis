Upon arrival in Singapore, I found my suitcase badly dented and reported the damaged to Scoot's handling agent, SATS in Singapore. SATS will not handle the damage and directed me to to claim from Scoot Insurance Assessor online. That evening I dutifully submitted the claim with all supporting photos from SATS, boarding pass, etc. Response was prompt however unhelpful, it directed me to claim from my travel insurer which I refused. A reply from the Scoot's assessor requesting the same documents that were submitted in the online claim. Resend. Reply again requesting for same documents. Explained and objected. Reply and requesting for more photos! The whole process made my trip rather unpleasant! I decided to ignore that email. I was only claiming SGD 200 for the 2 year old damaged suitcase.

As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable.

scoot,890800,2024-03-15,1,Australia,Trip Verified,“A disgrace to Singapore”,"Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions.

Cheap, efficient and inflexible. My wife and I bought tickets from Sydney to Yogyakarta. I knew I might need to change my flight for work, but that my wife wouldn't.

On the day of my flight I discovered that I would indeed need to extend my stay I. Singapore, so got to the airport early and asked the staff to flex my ticket. They said they couldnt do it in Sydney, but I could do it in Singapore no problems. We landed in Singapore and the service desk said they could only change the ticket for one month and at a high fee, and that I should ring the 24/7 call centre. I rang the call centre and they had a recorded message saying they were too busy and to use the online chat. I spent an hour on the online chat, only to be told I couldn't change it online because I had already flown the first leg, even though that is what their staff told me to do! So I got up and went back to the airport with my wife to check her in, and make the one month change, only to be told by the morning staff that that was impossible and that the maximum I could change my ticket by was one week. The entire time, at every single stage of interaction the staff were grumpy, rude and every person tried to fob me off to someone else. This was also true of the staff on the plane. I have never experienced an airline that is so consistently mean spirited and where the staff are grumpy.

It was an excellent alternative to flying normal economy class being good value, good service with the comfort of a smaller cabin, bigger seats and priority check-in etc. The premium cabin has been renamed Scoot Plus some time ago but product remained the same. However, things appear to have changed. The cabin on this flight was dirty, the crew disinterested, the ""one"" complimentary drink served with the meal can no longer be a choice including wine/beer as you can only buy this as apparently the policy has changed and only water, soft drink, tea or coffee can be chose. I was informed I could only buy a wine when the Scoot Cafe opens. The meals were served immediately the flight reached cruising altitude and were being collected before I had even started. The lights were dimmed during the meal service and the crew disappeared. Other passengers started ringing the bell to order from the Scoot Cafe as it seems no trolley was going to appear. I thought selling food and drinks was the way to make money on these budget airlines! The crew freely allowed passengers from the back of the plane to use the one and only lavatory in the front of the premium cabin.

Also, their manager was unhelpful and avoided clarifying my issues with me. He said that he would escalate the matter to HQ and will update by the end of his work shift. But he did not do so as well. This resulted in me calling the call centre serveral times as I could not reach the manager nor the first agent that handled my case.

So 2 hours before my flight to Australia I was running back and forth between two Scoot desks to find out what was this about with no luck, no one gave me any info.

Scoot advertises itself as the small subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (""The little sister of Singapore Airlines""). This is certainly correct in terms of content, but it is absolutely misleading. The service Scoot offers has nothing to do with the fantastic Singapore Airlines! Absolute nothing! Scoot is an absolute no-frills airline in its purest form, even worse than Ryanair. The passenger has to pay for everything. It starts when booking with the food on board, continues with extra luggage and seat reservations. If you don't pay for your seat, a seat will be allocated to you during check-in without any choice for you. And, on board, the customers' money continues to be taken out of their pockets. If you want to drink water on board, which real airlines serve free of charge and in abundance to their passengers for health reasons, you have to pay for it at Scoot. There is no entertainment programme on board, not even monitors to track the flight route. If you use your mobile phone, tablet, etc., you will definitely run out of power during a 12-13 hour flight. There are power sockets, but if you want electricity for charging, you have to pay for it. Regarding the service on board: The staff was always friendly and nice. Thank you for that. But, the food is pretty much the most unappealing and uncharitable food I have seen in my life. And it doesn't even taste good. You are given simple, welded food containers and a can of water.

I never experienced something like this on an intercontinental flight, I thought it was not even allowed. You could of course buy something but totally overprice, like a small cola for 5 euros. Honestly, low cost has gone too far. The seats were as small as the ones of a 2 hours Ryanair flight, but for 13 hours. In addition, it was so unfortunate that I had to sit in the very last row, in which you couldn’t put the chair back, not even just 1 cm.

I got to my seat and I over heard the flight attendants that did not wear name badges, speaking in Japanese about of have to make sure the fat lady has a seat belt extender. This the behavior you allow for your company. Then one comes up to me and pulls the seat belt and extends it then says you need an extender. Not ask but stated that I needed one. Still remaining calm I told her I already have one of my own and proceed to click it to get her smoothly. She leaves and talk with the previous attendant that was talking bad about me and comes back saying it’s not safe for me to use my own seatbelt extender belt. Then shoves theirs in my hand and says be sure to give this back at the end of flight and stayed until I removed mine and connected theirs to the seat belt. The attendant walks off says something else that I could not fully hear but definitely heard I’m going to mark her seat down so she doesn’t steals it to the previous attendant they both laugh. I proceeded to state I really don’t need this extension belt and you two are making me uncomfortable and we haven’t even taken off. They lie and says it’s policy and then walk off. Fast forward to 2/3 of the flight nearly ending the same attendant wakes me out of my sleep to tell me don’t forget to leave the extension belt in the seat when I leave. I calmly say ok even though I am boiling because of the assumption of assuming that I’m going to steal a extension belt extender, then when we land and the seatbelt light is off. I took off the seat belt and detached everything and left in the seat. The same harassing attendant comes up to me and demands I give her the seatbelt extender. I reach behind me and get it for her and said I thought you wanted me to leave it in the seat but please do take note that you have it back in your hands.

There is no video screen, no in-flight entertainment, and the only Wi-Fi we were able to access went directly to their service site where you could order food and drinks.

I only get up from my seat to stretch occasionally and always bring my own entertainment options, no matter what is offered in-flight. I don’t need a lot of space or amenities to be content, even though I’m not a small guy. That was the initial attraction to ZIPAIR for me, not paying for things I wasn’t going to use. Entertainment? Bring your own (every seat has a USB-A charging port and they allow power banks, so don’t sweat the electrons). Meals, snacks, and drinks? Offered, but must be paid for separately either before you board, or in-flight via a browser interface using the plane’s WiFi system. Honestly, fine with me. I brought my own snacks and water on board, and used WiFi to order some drinks. The flights were incredibly smooth, the cabin staff were a vision of professionalism and care, the planes were spotless, and the seat comfort was better than expected despite being in Economy. For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty. Honestly, these are relatively minor complaints (especially WiFi, hardly a necessity), and I feel these in no way diminished the value of what I saved on my fare.

They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasn’t enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping.

It's absolutely unacceptable for an airline to operate in this manner, and I believe they should be held criminally liable for essentially stealing money from their customers.

Within the Kuala Lumpur baggage claim my baggage was lost/held up and was the last to go down the carousel with one package missing. Going to lost and oversized baggage claim area the officer had to trace where my luggage was which took a very long time. That said I rushed to the AirAsia departure area and asked the customer support which line I must join for baggage drop as they have no visual clues except alphanumerical clues. I was advised to join a the W line, after 15 minutes of waiting an officer asked me where I am going to which I replied “Perth, Australia”. He informed that I should be in the Y line. I rushed around to the Y line, with yet another group of travellers processing massive packages, that done I get to drop my bags to be told the baggage checkin has just closed. I can not catch the connecting flight. When I asked who I may speak to in this regard I was told an officer would be present in about 3 hours. I waited for the officer and presented my case about the luggage being held up, being sent to the wrong drop off point and missing the flight. I was told it was my fault for catching those flights and that I would have to pay more for myself and my luggage for the next flight.

No.  We had to wait in the check in line for over an hour waiting on other passengers to adjust their bags to avoid paying extra baggage fees - if it was one group I would understand, but it was every single one of them, and the gate agents did nothing about this.

He sends the first 2 bags to be loaded and continues to the next 2 bags. On the second 2 bags he puts a transfer ticket on them without telling us that he forgot to on the first 2 bags. We noticed it but he didn't think we did. After going thru security, we talked about it and came to the conclusion that we needed to talk to someone. We couldn't afford for these bags to be delayed so we asked the security agent who we should talk to. He directs us to go back thru security and talk to the supervisor. We asked 2 people for a manager, they refused to get a manager and offered to help themselves. When we expressed our concern they offered to check our bags and they went to the sorting area and came back stating that our bags have already been sealed and cannot be checked. We then went to a security manager to express our concern and we were able to finally talk to the desk manage. He told us he could pull the bags to check, but I'd he did, they will probably not make the flight.  We arrive to Manila and departed the plane and took a bus to terminal 3.

Right hand front toilet consistently with a queue of 3 to 8 people. I then found out that the left hand front toilet cabin staff were saying it was not in use despite a green light showing. Then when i pushed the matter they admitted that it was reserved for the Captain only. Absolutely unbelievable! The one working right front toilet was a total disgrace, absolutely filthy with no toilet tissue and contaminated water swilling on the floor. During turbulence announcements cabin crew took no action at all to ask the queue for the toilet to return to their seats despite they themselves strapped in ( a major safety issue!). Not even one pot of noodles available during flight and not even any hot drinks at all. Pre ordered food choices were not available and PAX fobbed off with other alternatives of which the quality was lousy. Generally the cabin crew were inattentive and spend a lot of time just sitting down. No pro active action to do more than the very basic.

I think they just didn't set it up to handle online traffic very well. It disrupted my booking constantly and worse, didn't process my payment properly so the booking was not confirmed, yet I was charged on my credit card. Their customer service is a Facebook chat and the staff are unfortunately not even trusted by their company with anything to do with my account so not very much help at all when I had to open a dispute on the charge since they never fixed that charge (to this day, months later and I had to book a second time, still unresolved and waiting for dispute case). The customer service help desk shouldn't be a Facebook chat - should be an actual phone line and their staff should be trained on account matters. Also their website currently is confusing with an ""old"" and ""new"" version for when you want to manage your booking. Certain options can only be done on either versions. The mobile app doesn't work at all. Always has an error. On the actual flight: the NRT>MNL plane does not have reclining seats and they do offer meals but you have to buy them. So if you are going to be hungry, eat before your board. While they were serving the snacks, I normally am okay and indifferent to the smell of instant noodles but somehow on that flight, it was just overpowering since we're in an enclosed space. After some time and just before our stomachs were going to turn inside out, thankfully the staff sprayed something in the air that eliminated the odor but I think serving such a strong smelling food is not good for flights in my opinion. The only thing I think that I can say is positive is that their check-in staff and cabin attendants were professional the entire time. I get they are a budget airline and for prices to be cheap, you compromise a lot on things but I think Cebu Pacific doesn't even meet the basic standards that other budget airlines do.

Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first.

Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight.

From the relentless PA announcements about how the crew should be treated, you'd think we were aboard a magical unicorn, not a plane. I get it, some passengers can be a handful, but did we really need to hear the ""be kind to your crew"" mantra four times during the flight? Speaking of the crew, they might want to consider that their primary role is to assist passengers. I asked for a glass of bottled water to take my heart medication. Her response? ""I can't help you, but you can pay $4.00 or drink tap water."" It wasn't about the four bucks; it was about the complete lack of empathy and urgency, especially when I explained that tap water wasn't an option due to my medical condition. Sure, I'd bring my own water onboard if I could, but thanks to Australian regulations, that's a no-go. For medical reasons, the crew should consider making exceptions or providing assistance.  The crew's customer service skills and smiles were about as rare as a blue moon. Upon landing in Sydney, the baggage ordeal was a two-hour-long spectacle. No announcements, no apologies. They even managed to announce the wrong baggage belt twice before passengers had to play detective to locate their belongings. It was absolute chaos – more circus than a well-oiled operation. The only reason I'm being generous with a 1 and not a 0 is because the aircraft did land safely.

The flight delayed for hours, after our original flight was canceled a day before. We were not allowed to check the pram in at the gate.

We complained because the pram was not an issue on our previous flight. It's weird and unreasonable because how come the rules in Sydney and Melb are different. But the staff did not accept the complaint and gave us 2 non-negotiable options. 1. Pay the extra charge (double from the normal price) or 2. If we are not willing to pay the charge, they will move us to the next flight for us to checked in the pram but it will cost us more money.

But Jetstar called us all down to the already crowded departure area, to spend the time milling about and trying to work out if there was a queue. Seats were comfortable if basic.

Then they lied as we were told the hotel was close to the airport when in fact it was 25km away as I noticed when we were on the bus the driver drove past the area where they told us the hotel was so I asked him where he was going to which he replied ""Phuket town"". If I knew that before I could have gone to my home in Phuket instead and save myself a lot of time. But because they said it was close to the airport I figured there was no point going home. We got there around 3am and aircons blew hot air then got told we would be picked up at 1pm to go to the airport even know the hotel manager stated a late check out was totally fine. We got to the airport before 2pm and check in didn't open until 0340pm and i got told by check in staff the flight might be cancelled again as there were not enough first aid supplies on board and they needed to be flown in. At check in we got a 300baht voucher which was only valid at burger king where meals start around 500baht. The flight got further delayed because aircraft was not ready yet. So I missed a whole day of precious family time whom I hadn't seen for 7.5 years plus spent a lot of money on overpriced airport priced food and drinks. The crew was nice put the plane was dirty as hell. Dust everywhere, drink marks etc. When we landed in Sydney they parked us on a remote stand near cargo and we couldn't disembark because the AFP had to come onboard. After that there were no busses available as Qantas parked an A380 on the bay next to us and those passenger had to be disembarked by bus too. Once through customs I went hunting for Jetstar Australia customer service. A very rude agent told me to go to the office on the 3rd floor, when I got there in was closed and dark. I went back down and asked her why she sent me to a closed office. Then some ladies with Jetstar uniforms where there but apparently they worked for Swissport. The supervisor seemed very cold and had lack of empathy and tried to brush me off and was very condescending. She told me to go online and contact Jetstar or call the call center but then said call center might be a waste of time (really?) I am not gonna let this go. I will be pushing for compensation!
