The journey was a pleasant one despite the episode of my child became very unwell, alternating between drowsy and cranky in the mid of the journey. We sought the crew for help. They are very professional, helpful and friendly. They checked us out first, discussed with their captain and then prep us on the travel duration and preparation on ground. Besides, they offered ice pack/wet kitchen towels along the way. Nearing to the destination, they even moved me and my son to the front row. The flight arrived 20 minutes earlier.

Upon starting to use the toilet (after about 15 seconds) there was a very load banging on the door. As I started to stop proceedings and get presentable the banging noise increased and so I rushed to get out asap. As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable.

2024-03-15,1,Australia,Trip Verified,“A disgrace to Singapore”,"Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions.

Instead of assisting us, we were repeatedly told to ""just queue"". However, when we reached the front of the queue, we were told that check in for our flight had closed and refused to let us board. They referred us to another counter, where we were blamed for not approaching them earlier and were again refused boarding. We finally escalated the issue to a manager, who realised that we had already checked in online and needed to get to the gate quickly for boarding. We rushed over and made our flight.

Cheap, efficient and inflexible. My wife and I bought tickets from Sydney to Yogyakarta. I knew I might need to change my flight for work, but that my wife wouldn't. I explained that to the online agent, who told me to pay extra and get a flexible ticket but because booking together I would have to pay for flexible ticket for both of us, so I did that. On the day of my flight I discovered that I would indeed need to extend my stay I. Singapore, so got to the airport early and asked the staff to flex my ticket. They said they couldnt do it in Sydney, but I could do it in Singapore no problems. We landed in Singapore and the service desk said they could only change the ticket for one month and at a high fee, and that I should ring the 24/7 call centre. I rang the call centre and they had a recorded message saying they were too busy and to use the online chat. I spent an hour on the online chat, only to be told I couldn't change it online because I had already flown the first leg, even though that is what their staff told me to do! So I got up and went back to the airport with my wife to check her in, and make the one month change, only to be told by the morning staff that that was impossible and that the maximum I could change my ticket by was one week. The entire time, at every single stage of interaction the staff were grumpy, rude and every person tried to fob me off to someone else. This was also true of the staff on the plane. I have never experienced an airline that is so consistently mean spirited and where the staff are grumpy.

I have had no updates (not a single email or phone call) sent to me about the status of refund, the customer service team show no skill at fixing this issue and the last staff member I spoke to over the phone had an attitude and was completely unhelpful.

2024-01-26,2,Australia,Trip Verified,“extremely disappointed in the standard”,"When I first flew Scoot a few years ago, the ""premium"" class was called Scoot Biz although it was really just a premium economy product. It was an excellent alternative to flying normal economy class being good value, good service with the comfort of a smaller cabin, bigger seats and priority check-in etc. The premium cabin has been renamed Scoot Plus some time ago but product remained the same. However, things appear to have changed. The cabin on this flight was dirty, the crew disinterested, the ""one"" complimentary drink served with the meal can no longer be a choice including wine/beer as you can only buy this as apparently the policy has changed and only water, soft drink, tea or coffee can be chose. I was informed I could only buy a wine when the Scoot Cafe opens. The meals were served immediately the flight reached cruising altitude and were being collected before I had even started. The lights were dimmed during the meal service and the crew disappeared. Other passengers started ringing the bell to order from the Scoot Cafe as it seems no trolley was going to appear. I thought selling food and drinks was the way to make money on these budget airlines! The crew freely allowed passengers from the back of the plane to use the one and only lavatory in the front of the premium cabin. I paid a lot of money for this flight for me, my wife and daughter (being the end of the school holidays in Australia) and was extremely disappointed in the standard of pretty much everything on this and another recent Scoot flight.",Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore,Perth,,January 2024,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,no,Boeing 787-9,2.0

I do not know about this and went to check in exactly 48h as per recommended thus was being assigned the worst seats ever. Non-reclined chair and near the toilet. The system is not smart enough to know that I'm travelling in group of 4 and to assign seats to us together thus I was assigned 3 seats in row 30 (right side of aircraft) and 1 seat in row 29 (left window seat of aircraft). I tried to change the seats by calling the call centre but they couldn't. The agent escalated my case and told me will return a call to me the next day for an update. However, she did not. So I decided to call back and found out that she had knocked off work for that day. I tried to communicate with other agents regarding my case but eventually it was still unresolved. Also, their manager was unhelpful and avoided clarifying my issues with me. He said that he would escalate the matter to HQ and will update by the end of his work shift. But he did not do so as well. This resulted in me calling the call centre serveral times as I could not reach the manager nor the first agent that handled my case. Eventually, when I spoke to 2 of his agents regarding my case, they hung up my call as they said that they couldn't assist me and had to attend to other customers. I was upset with how unprofessional they had attended to my seat flight case and the empty promises that the agents said they will return me a call but no one had ever returned a call to me until I persisted in my callings to reach one of them. However, I'm grateful that when I approached the check in counter staff during my departure, the front counter staff managed to change the seats as there were still available seats on the flight.

Another agent also claims that ""its a secret that the system assigned starting from the last row"". I told the agent its unfair to not make this known to customers especially when its a common understanding that last row seats are one of the worst seats to sit.

Then, they couldn't get the plane off the ground, so on top of being 30 minutes late, they couldn't take off for nearly another hour. So the plane finally took off well over an hour late. Most ridiculous, was that the seat next to me was empty, and I set my jacket on that seat. The flight attendant made me remove my jacket from the seat for takeoff, and also remove my headphones. No US carrier makes you remove your headphones for takeoff. Is this an Asian thing, or are they that challenged that they think that is an effective safety measure.

They looked depressed, pressured, and tired as if they hated their job. However, once on board, the team of flight attendants changed the mood of the flight. They ensured everyone was well looked after with their positive attitude throughout the flight. The seats gave me extra few inches of legroom and were surprisingly comfortable. That, combined with the A320NEO's new cabin feel, was a perfect recipe for a clean, comfortable, and awesome flight. The in-flight entertainment was rich in content and easy to use, however, being a Wi-Fi-based entertainment used by many people on the flight, the signal strength was incredibly weak. That, and the less-than-good ground staff team at Yogyakarta, were the only two things preventing this flight from getting a solid 10/10. The landing was around 10 minutes ahead of schedule, and the ground staff team in Singapore quickly arranged our bags at a special spot thanks to the long immigration queue in Singapore.

On my last trip with them, I was told upon checking in, that I had 11 euro credit on my account and the lady at the counter was not able to give me my ticket till I pay. She did not tell me what this payment was for (I asked, but she didn’t know) and redirected me to the cashier (who was supposed to give me all the details). There, again, I was told that he didn’t know any details of the payment (“sort this out directly with the airline”), just that I need to pay. So 2 hours before my flight to Australia I was running back and forth between two Scoot desks to find out what was this about with no luck, no one gave me any info. I was naïve enough to think that this was probably just a system issue – I gave up and paid, I thought I would resolve the issue with customer service afterward. Wow, how stupid I was. I sent the refund request via Scoot website explaining the situation. I got the reply that the charge was for the seat selection, which I apparently requested and on which I was apparently informed.

The points apply to all legs of the journey, although the long haul Berlin-Singapore and back is clearly more significant and determines the rating. Scoot advertises itself as the small subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (""The little sister of Singapore Airlines""). This is certainly correct in terms of content, but it is absolutely misleading. The service Scoot offers has nothing to do with the fantastic Singapore Airlines! Absolute nothing! Scoot is an absolute no-frills airline in its purest form, even worse than Ryanair. The passenger has to pay for everything. It starts when booking with the food on board, continues with extra luggage and seat reservations. If you don't pay for your seat, a seat will be allocated to you during check-in without any choice for you. And, on board, the customers' money continues to be taken out of their pockets. If you want to drink water on board, which real airlines serve free of charge and in abundance to their passengers for health reasons, you have to pay for it at Scoot. There is no entertainment programme on board, not even monitors to track the flight route. If you use your mobile phone, tablet, etc., you will definitely run out of power during a 12-13 hour flight. There are power sockets, but if you want electricity for charging, you have to pay for it. Regarding the service on board: The staff was always friendly and nice. Thank you for that. But, the food is pretty much the most unappealing and uncharitable food I have seen in my life. And it doesn't even taste good. You are given simple, welded food containers and a can of water. If you know real quality airlines, what Scoot delivers is a huge disappointment. On the return flight SIN-BER, the folding tables (several in my row) were so dirty. I guess they have not been cleaned for a long time. Thank god I had disinfectant and a cloth with me. Yikes, Scoot! In summary, it must be said that the customer at Scoot is apparently only there to flush money into the company. There is no question of appreciation of the flight guests. These flights fall into the category: There is no second chance for a first impression. We flew exactly twice with Scoot, the first and the last time.

Arrived Changi Airport at 6.30 pm. Layover time at Changi Airport was 1 hour. No information regarding Covid Testing for transit. No clear instruction by cabin crew as to whether to proceed to Terminal 1. No staff at Scoot C-counter. Very confused, worried, exhausted and stressful because Air Asia and Thai Airways staff had to contact Scoot. Last flight to Kuala Lumpur was 7.30 pm. Stayed at Changi Airport till 17/1/23 for connecting flight to Kuala Lumpur at 9.30 am via TR453. The journey was supposed to take approximately 9 hours but it took more than 20 hours to arrive Kuala Lumpur. The long delay and uncertainties as to how and when I could arrive at Kuala Lumpur caused great inconvenience for family members to drive 2 days to pick me up at KLIA2. On arrival at KLIA2, lost luggage, waiting more than 2 hours at carousel. I contacted Scoot customer service but they were unable to assist. After numerous calls and emails, suitcase was finally delivered on 19/1/23. Not impressed at all. 27/1/23. From Kuala Lumpur to Changi Airport, the staff at Kuala Lumpur provided better service. The layover time at Changi Airport was 17.20 hours and incurring additional hotel bills. If direct flights, no hotels required. When boarded TR22, the take-off time from Changi Airport to Melbourne was again delayed by 1.5 hours due to transit passengers from Berlin. Cabin crew did not offer to load hand luggage into overhead lockers unless requested. Food was not served earlier and the meal was only served once in very small portion with additional waiting time of 20 minutes to heat up the food. I felt very hungry. No blankets and cushions were provided unless purchase. Total travel duration and layover time was approximately 26 hours. Very uncomfortable seats and the toilet is small.

When we checked in physically at the counter, the boarding pass were issued accordingly. However, after boarding the flight to Bangkok minutes just before the plane took off, the airline staff requested us to vacate the seats and move to the back row seats as though they did not know we had paid for front extra leg room seas (I shown them the receipts and boarding pass). Despite having secured 2 extra leg room seats as indicated in the boarding pass. Different staff appeared and indicated that the plane has been changed last minute and the current seats belonged to Scootplus and we must move to row 31 and 32. She took our boarding pass and use pen to amend the boarding pass seat number. We paid additional additional fare of SGD 190 for 2 to remain in Scootplus and requested for the refund of SGD 54 for extra leg rooms seats (2). After 2 weeks, still no news although the hotline said they would investigate and revert. The experience was certainly not something we cherished. It was ok to change plane due to unforeseen circumstances but refund should be made for overpayment. For any underpayment, we were happy to top up as well.

In reality we landed in Bangkok, everyone had to leave the plane, go through security and then back into the plane 30 mins later. Then we sat there in the plane for 1 hour without much information before the pilot tells us that the plane (787) is not airworthy due to a mechanical error, and they need to organise a new plane. Then we were given a voucher for food and told that a new plane was set up at 8pm, then they said 11pm, then 12am (14 hours later).

Fair enough, I want to change the date. But according to airport information, there is no Scoot counter or Scoot staff in the airport until 12 hours later, so calling Scoot is the only possibility other than waiting 12 hours.

After explaining that the plane I'm waiting 14 hours for is not currently up in the air, but is in fact delayed (they were clueless and kept on insisting that I must be on the plane, in the air), they would not allow me to change or cancel my flight. Why? Because I am in transit, and if I wanted a refund/change, I should have done it before taking off from Singapore (I obviously didn't know the plane was going to be delayed back then, and I was even told we would not disembark in Bangkok).

I then proceed to make a new booking, that is a one-way trip, from Melbourne to Singapore, and cost me around $500. When I am at the Melbourne airport, they asked me to look for the Singapore Service centre, which means I need to fly back right? But when I am back in Singapore, all service centres were all closed and there was absolutely no one there to assist me. Mind you, I seat an 8 hours economy flight and it was already 3am in the morning in Singapore. Now that I called the service centre, they are telling me I cannot get my refund back.

While I understand the logic in a bid where the misc fees already paid for seats, food etc. would boost the chances of securing the upgrade, I don't see the case since we were already onboard, had reasonably comfortable seats, with meals reserved and couldn't take advantage of the additional baggage that an upgrade provided and so didn't proceed. Scoot could have earned additional $362 if both of us had upgraded without incurring additional costs but it didn't happen because of its illogical pricing and many ScootPlus seats were left empty. Mid-flight I walked around the cabin only to realised that many rows of first row seats in economy were empty when it was indicated full when I made my seat reservations. Be it technical glitch or last min cancellations, saving grace would be for the cabin crew to offer to shift me and my partner or the guy next to us given we had indicated that we were unhappy that our row was the only one completely full, but no initiative was taken. I'm also still waiting for my miles from the bid to upgrade to be credited. Yes, it's a miserable 302 miles but Scoot should honour what it promised.

2020-01-29,1,Australia,Trip Verified,"""needs to be more courtesy""","I took Scoot on a return flight from Melbourne to Singapore. There's no in-flight entertainment, but this is acceptable given that it's a budget flight. What is unacceptable is the lack of cabin service. On the first flight, I was told by a crew member that no outside food was allowed. This is unreasonable as I have strict dietary requirements and could consume none of the main meals offered on board. None of the other airlines that I have flown with have ever picked an issue with passengers bringing their own food on board. I tried to buy a packet of nuts with my debit card but the crew first rejected my debit card, and asked for cash or credit card (which I had none), without giving any reasons. Only after I asked for the reasons that I found out that there is a limit of $20 spending on debit cards and they are phasing out debit card payments. I'm certain this wasn't made known to passengers prior to boarding. This is terrible for passengers on long haul flights who aren't aware of this limit, on top of the fact that Scoot does not allow outside food or serve water for free. The return flight was dismal. I had paid for a seat upgrade but found out that my seat could not recline as the button had dropped out. This was obviously a problem that the airline had previously known of, as there was duct tape around the sharp edges around where the button would have been. I highlighted this to the a cabin crew and her response was ""oh ya, doesn't work. Sorry about that"" and tried to walk off! I had to ask if there was a replacement seat, and (of course) there wasn't any in the same seat class. The cabin crew also talk over passengers to each other across the aisles and can come across as quite curt in their instructions / responses to passengers. I get that Scoot is trying to create a young and less formal vibe but there needs to be more courtesy in the way the cabin crew treat passengers. It is honestly quite embarrassing that Scoot is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, which prides itself on its high standards of service.

2019-12-17,5,Australia,Trip Verified,"""does what they say on the box""","Singapore to Sydney. For the most part, this airline does what they say on the box. It's a budget airline so you know you'll get the bare minimum unless you pay more which is fine. I was really disappointed with the meal service, I prebooked a ""meal, drink and snack"". They gave me no choice of drink and would only give me a 350ml bottle of water which I think is really misleading.  The meal was served almost immediately after departure for an 8 hour flight and I was told I couldn't  have it later. The flight left at about 0715 and my meal was a lunch/dinner option yet they served it as breakfast anyway. Refusing to give me an option honestly made it seem like they were rushing them out ASAP to get it out of the way since they already had my money, choosing to not care about what the customer wants, and hoping the unnecessarily early meal would lead to me needing a second meal later in the flight. I fly scoot semi-regularly and will never pre-book a meal again as a result. If it's any cheaper to pre-book it's only by about $1-2, so definitely not worth being misled about the drink and then force-fed the second you get on the plane. The stinginess with drinks doesn't even go away in their business class cabin which I've flown a couple of times in the past. They say you get a complimentary alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink, but upon asking for something like a whiskey and coke, you get told that whiskey is one free complimentary drink, so if you want coke it's a second drink you have to pay for! The only other issue I encountered was with the automatic check-in, where it refused to take my bag several times despite it being well within all the relevant limits. However, even with that delay, it was much quicker than with many other airlines so I can't really complain. I can't really fault the airline otherwise, they do pretty good deals and the seats aren't too bad. There's no inflight entertainment but in this day and age, I'd rather download something on my phone. Just ensure you have plenty of power as you'll be charged if you want to use the USB charger in your seat. I wouldn't recommend Scoot for a long journey like Australia to Europe, but for flights up to around 8 hours they're fine, just don't expect much other than a seat and a safe journey.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore,Sydney,,November 2019,3.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,4,yes,,

Our group had traveled with 2 children one 1 year and 10 months and the other 2 years and 25 days old. Since my daughter was over 2 years she was given a separate seat and charged fully (acceptable as she has exceeded the age of the infant) Then during the take off they wanted her to sit separately in her seat and wear a seat belt. The kid had slept sitting on her moms lap as the flight's take off time was only by 12 20 am. The air hostess took her forcefully and put her on the other seat and it was a rough time after that. Then the hostess said sorry and accepted to let her sit with the mother. The same thing happened on our way back from Singapore. The steward tried to put my daughter in the separate seat and she wouldn't sit. there was an announcement from the pilot that the flight will be taken back to the gate if the child doesn't sit in the seat. Luckily she slept for a while and we could lean her onto her seat and managed to put the seat belt over her.

Scoot however, revised their schedule a couple of weeks before my flight, reducing my layover time by 20 minutes. On the flight day, we saw that the flight was re-timed. We went to the check in counter to entire, but the counter staff were not even aware that the flight was re-timed. They checked and advised us that the flight departure time will be delayed by 2 hours, but the arrival time will remain the same, which is ridiculous. We went through the customs and went straight to the gate. The gate did not even display the updated flight time. There was no communication to the passengers, all waiting in vain and frustrated. No customer service representative came to address the issue. We called up the call center, which was outsourced, and they too, have no idea that the flight was re-timed. We went to confirm with the lounge staff, who advised us there was in fact a delay of 2 hours, arrival time will be delayed by another 2 hours too. We understand that the delay was due to the earlier flight being delayed, because they were waiting for 8 passengers who were performing their transit. In other words, Scoot opted to delay a whole plane full of passengers, just to accommodate to the 8 people. Very poor decision making and management on Scoot's behalf. While we were on the plane but yet to depart, the plane was being delayed for another hour. We understand that this was due to accommodating to the request of a single passenger who decided to disembark and then changed his mind to reembark again. This decision, again, costed the whole plane full of passengers another hour, just for the sake of a single passenger. We were seeking updates from the stewardess during the delay, but she does not have any clue as to what is happening, and she had this irritating habit of touching her hair once every 10 seconds or so. I missed my connecting flight eventually, and had to book another connecting flight. I wrote in to Scoot for the compensation. Their customer support team is outsourced, and have no clue that the flight was delayed. They kept insisting that the flight delay was less than 3 hours, until I requested them to show me the actual departure time and actual arrival time, versus the scheduled departure and arrival time. They kept replying with copy-and-pasted templates which added to my frustration. They have this ""promise to you"" page on their website which says that they will compensate with a travel voucher for any delay more than 3 hours. It has been more than a month since I raised this claim and till now, it has not been resolved. The issue being transferred from one customer service officer to another. Not too sure if they even intend to deliver this promise that they state on their website. Comprehensive travel insurance does not cover delay of less than 6 hours, but their customer service officer kept asking me to check with the insurance company for compensation. Scoot is an irresponsible airline, with poor customer service. With so many of Scoot's recent delays in the news, now I understand, this is of no surprise.

For the to SG flight, the ground crew were bordering talking down to the people trying the board (I get any group can be hard to deal with when not following instructions but you need to have some sort of control and courtesy). They called for first row, seniors, board me first. I was in the first row so I went yet the lady kept raising her voice and telling me later. I pointed out the seat number and told her to look at everyone tickets first. For the back to MNL flight, the ground crew just seemed inconsistent and rushed, eventually giving up on the section style bordering and just took everyone. It is what it is. As one can expect from a budget airline, there is no IFE and the food is not included. I found the menu very very pricey though even knowing their strategy.

2019-05-21,1,Australia,Trip Verified,"""regarding the excess luggage""","Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. To Scoot or not to Scoot In just one single trip I have come to the following conclusion about Scoot. There is inconsistency in the way they treat seat luggage allowance wise at different airports which cost us a lot. The web portal crashed multiple times when I tried to book luggage ... in the crash dump it said that they had ""been informed"" ... right. Maybe if the portal had worked I could have paid $105 return for luggage for my son as well instead of the total of $540. The air hostesses seems to look down on people, at least my wife who is kindness incarnated. The air hostesses seemed to have no information on extra seats and who is entitled to use them. The air hostesses apparently just assumed that we were getting off in Singapore .... the way they handled the stroller part in the story border lines theft of $400 in my books. It was only that I broke a massive sweat to ""pull it from the dumpster"" that I got my property back. The people in service phone has no clue about prices of luggage, again it seems this case falls out of their flow chart. The customer support does not respond, responds consistently only after the 10 days probably to wear you down and will apparently try and make you give up by death by paragraphs ... but I can read and this has become a matter of principle for me. The main issue was the the fact that we got trapped on the return to Gold Coast with luggage conditions that were suddenly different in Bangkok than in Gold Coast. This cost us A$300 extra  but even though thats a lot of money, there is a certain amount of unfairness to it which is why I am making my voice heard. I have written to Scoot regarding the excess luggage and waited the 10 days without a reply from them. Then I wrote again and have waited another 10 days without hearing anything. But then I heard from them with the following message: ""Our record shows that you have purchased an extra seat for your infant, however, infants are not considered as a full paying passenger. You may refer to our Conditions of Carriage 3.3 regarding infant passenger."" In fact under baggage allowance it says ""Infants not occupying a seat have no Checked Baggage allowance"" which must mean that our son, since he occupied a seat either had a checked baggage allowance or at least was allowed to have one. So, they seem they will do anything to deflect. I have written to them with this argument. And they replied back that they have considered it and that infants occupying a seat still cannot have Checked Baggage allowance.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Gold Coast,Bangkok,Singapore,April 2019,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,

Every experience with them has been frustrating and ridiculous. I have never encountered more unhelpful and incompetent people in my whole life than those who work at scoots call centers and airport transfer desks.  I tried to check my bag in online but the website links did not work, the app did not work, and it took 30 mins to get through to call center. The representative put me on hold after every question because it was clear he did not know how to answer basic questions. Finally, he informed me bag would have cost 400 Singapore dollars if I had checked it in at the airport counter! And this is insane considering how extremely difficult it was for me to check it in ahead of time with none of their websites or apps working properly.  I was wondering if they intentionally cause their website and app to not work properly so that customers who need to check a bag get trapped at the airport with a fee twice as much as the actual flight. I also tried to check in through Scoot’s app 3 hours before flight. To my panic, the app said that my flight had already departed which was entirely not true since it was 3 whole hours early! A kind of glitch like this is unacceptable on every level because of the panic that it would cause!!

The 3 emergency exit seats in the middle row were empty. After take off, I moved to the empty seats in the middle because I was unwell. I did this because I wanted to lie down, I wanted to be in closer proximity to the bathroom and I wanted to distance myself from the other passengers. Two staff initially asked me to move because the seats I was sitting on cost extra.

Instead of empathising with me, she treated me as though I was being dishonest. She aggressively asked me if I had a fever. I said I did not but I had other unpleasant symptoms. She demanded I list all my symptoms in front of the other passengers. I asked her if it was really necessary to openly list all my symptoms because it was embarrassing for me. This did not appeal to her sensibilities and, once again, she demanded to know what my symptoms were. I listed my symptoms in front of everyone. This was very humiliating for me. She then said I should have told the staff I was sick at the beginning of the flight. I informed her that I had done this. She then told me I could lay down on the vacant seats but not sit up. It made no logical sense. Nate said she would tell the Captain and alert the ground staff. She delivered this as though it was a threat but I agreed this was ok because I had nothing to hide.  When the plane landed a medic was called on board. The medic asked me one question - do I have a fever? I said no and he immediately let me exit the plane. He said that he only needed to be called on board if I had a fever in the last 24 hours. However I had already told staff earlier that I hadn’t had a fever, so why did she organise for a medic to board the plane on arrival?

There are some things to consider if you fly with Scoot. It’s ultra low cost in all aspects. Long lines for check-in which took about an hour. My bag was 20,8 kg and my hand luggage 5 kg. I had to shift some luggage to my hand luggage to prevent paying for overweight. In the end it doesn’t matter because the same weight is going onboard. No wonder it took ages at check-in if they do this for everyone. I paid extra for the quiet ‘child free’ cabin in front of the aircraft. Rows 4 to 8 are supposed to be quiet but it doesn’t add any value because there’s no bulkhead and with kids seated in rows 9 and 10 I wouldn’t call it a quiet cabin. They strictly enforce the ‘no own food and drinks’ policy onboard. Like a strict teacher a member of the cabin crew passed by every few minutes to tell passengers they were not allowed to eat food not purchased onboard. This was forbidden according to Singapore law. Just a lame excuse because there is no such law and it’s just a company policy to generate more revenue. Don’t order meals online because you pay 15 US Dollar, while onboard it will cost you only 15 Singapore Dollar. I ordered a hot meal and a soft drink onboard. According to their menu it costs 18 SD, because you get 1 SD discount when you order a meal and a drink in once. I was charged 19 SD. I told them it should be 18 SD but they insisted it was 15 for the meal and 4 for the drink. Pointed them to their own menu and then I got the excuse that I should have ordered the combo deal instead of the meal and the drink. They simply do not think logically because it’s exactly the same. In the end I paid 18. There’s no IFE onboard, not even a screen with the flight time, arrival time, etc. The only entertainment is looking out of the window, which they also ruin because immediately after takeoff the windows are blinded until shortly before landing.

Scoot personnel would not let her board her flight, without paying 90 dollars for a ""mysterious"" and spurious cancellation fee. She never cancelled. The agent had issued the tickets, there wasn't any rescheduling, but, they insisted. This was a scam to get her to pay them 90 more than likely. She did not have the money, she had spent all of her money on family in the Philippines.  Why would she show up at airport if she cancelled? You can't just cancel a roundtrip, you must reschedule, or there would be flags and notifications everywhere. The flight from Singapore was still valid, and they didn't know of any cancellation. Spent two hours on a conference call with our ticketing agent and Scoot call-center. They kept saying there was a charge, but for what, there never was a cancellation.

Both flights were punctual, check in and boarding were reasonably efficient (you'd expect such at KIX, less so at DMK, but both were good). I was quite impressed with the cabin crews - they were very professional, warm and efficient. Seats were comfortable enough, although don;t expect lie flat, just a bit more recline. The only real negatives were 1) quirky IFE which runs on your laptop, tablet or phone - despite multiple downloads of plugins, flash players, etc I encountered compatibility problems throughout with hardware, browsers, etc and ultimately just gave up - this is far harder and more complicated than it should be, 2) on the outbound flight DMK-KIX the biz cabin was filled with babies and infants (due to school holidays in SG and MY I am guessing). I actually had a mum with lap child in the seat next to me and there is no way the child was under two years old (ie - needs a ticket). With all of the crying/screaming, etc I voluntary downgraded to the economy 'quiet zone', where the crew gave me a full row to myself - felt it was the right decision and appreciate the crew's assistance in ensuring my comfort. It is ironic though that Scoot charges more for economy passengers to sit in a quiet zone, yet offers no comparable alternative for biz passengers who are paying more money for their seat - this makes no sense to me, and 3) the whole idea of paying for in seat power (economy only) is another example of the pay for play model of low cost carriers, and suspect will be more broadly adapted by competitors. To summarise, the experience was good, not great, but acceptable.

Mum flew with me to Sydney for a short holiday in September and on the return flight, I was unable to fly with her due to work commitments. I therefore applied with Scoot for a special assistance of taking her through the security checking, immigration checkpoint as well as leading her to the right boarding gate as the boarding pass is printed all in English as well as providing a similar assistance at the arrival hall in Singapore. Very much appreciated by both mum and myself and very thankful that the Scoot crew both at the check in counter as well as the cabin crew had been very patience, approachable and understanding of her conditions and had been taking great care of her on the plane making her felt at ease and removing her stress and worries by going extra miles of cracking jokes with her. This is especially so when Scoot had also arranged, at the arrival hall in Singapore, to had her wheeled out of the aircraft, led her to the immigration checkpoint as well as assisting her collecting her 2 pieces of luggage (40kgs in total) which is too heavy for an elderly to remove from the conveyance belt.

Having booked and paid for my ticket several months in advance, I was most surprised to receive an email about two weeks out from my flight advising that my sector from Singapore to Melbourne had been replaced by a Singapore Airlines charter. The email contained several links for various responses. As I had booked and paid for an extended legroom seat to mitigate a back complaint that I suffer from, I was concerned when I read that all pre-booked anything such as seats, meals or other services had simply been cancelled. When I tried contacting Scoot, none of the links worked. I tried emailing on several occasions, but all my inquiries went unanswered. I eventually tracked down some phone numbers to their call centre, but all my calls went unanswered. When I eventually arrived in Singapore from Europe, I finally had success on the day before the flight from Singapore to Melbourne and managed to get through on a local number. I was then informed that the Scoot call centre had no ‘visibility’ of the flight and could not provide any assistance, despite being the same call centre to contact that had been mentioned in the original flight cancellation email. When I got to the airport, I found that I was going to be jammed into a middle seat in economy class. Apparently, the extended leg room seats had been auctioned off and as I hadn’t been able to make contact, I missed any opportunity to make representation to secure the seat that I had already booked and paid for! After a lengthy stoush at the counter where I had to be quite assertive to achieve an audience with a supervisor, I was finally successful in at least getting an aisle seat. Clearly, they were not happy with being taken to task as on the trip home the cabin crew made sure that any part of my body (I am 6’3”) that slightly protruded into the aisle was deliberately bumped as they went past. They were rude and aggressive when I protested their actions. When I left the aircraft, I was in considerable pain from the cramped seating I had endured and required pain killers for the next two days. My recommendation: under no circumstances fly Scoot as they do not provide the flights or seats that they advertise, have no empathy for customer health needs, are deceptive, mendacious, rude, aggressive and clearly have no interest or intention of providing any reasonable level of customer support or service.

I have never been more frustrated in my life dealing with anything, as I have trying to get a fair customer outcome with Scoot. I had booked two seats with extra legroom for my wife and I, as we had a young infant flying with us and needed extra room. Without notice, they had changed the aircraft we were flying on, and the seats I had chosen were not extra legroom seats any more, they were just ordinary seats.  There were more spacious seats available, but the crew insisted we had to pay to change to them. Anyway, that was not the frustrating part. Ever tried to get a refund from Scoot? I will tell you it is probably impossible. You would think it is straight forward: I paid for extra leg room seats -> they did not give me extra leg room seats -> therefore I should get a refund? Not so simple. I had paid $158 for the extra leg room seats, they told me they cannot refund me the whole amount as I had selected seats during the booking process so they had to charge me a seat selection fee (something like $20). I proceeded to tell them that the only reason I selected the seats were because I wanted extra space as we had an infant with us, not because I liked 11D and 11E. ""Sorry sir, it is our policy"", but they cannot actually point to this policy in any of their policy disclosure documents. No one I spoke with seemed to understand the basic concept that if I pay for a service and do not receive what I paid for, I should get a refund. They said they will escalate it and call me back. Three months had passed, no call. I call them back, have to re-explain myself, and they said they will escalate and call me back. This went on for a year (can you believe that). I have called again today, and concede just to refund me whatever they saw fit, guess what? They are escalating and calling me back soon. Oh and another thing, Scoot will never give you a cash refund, only in Scoot vouchers. Why would I fly scoot every again after an experience like this?

Got told off by check in staff at Narita  because our soft unstructured carry on was 6 cubic cm over the limit. 3. Got screamed at no food during transit because we bought orange juice for the kids. And comment given ""You must  buy our food. Forced us to wake the 2 year old up to be buckled up in his seat. And woke up the 7 year old because he is not seated properly with legs down. On return transit, got told to hurry up by ground crew from passing security to gate. Whilst they watch us dragging 2 groggy kids + hand luggage.  After the whole fiasco, we appreciated the flexibility and understanding of 2 member of the crew. Male crew on flight back to Singapore who saw the fuss brewing, explained nicely their situation, moved the other passengers and helped arrange the sleeping 2 year old. Check in staff at Singapore who handled the situation nicely on the check in bags. While I know that every airline has different policies to adhere to, I believe it is fair to expect some courtesy and customer centricness.

But we ended up having one extra luggage, instead of charging us one extra luggage fee, they requested us to pay for $20SGD per KG for excess weight , which equivalent to total of $400SGD for one extra luggage. On our return flight, SIN to Taiwan, we experience very bad customer service with the ground crew who were giving us attitudes. The seats on the plane were extremely small, I’m only 5’ tall and my feet was already touching the back of the seat in front of me. I had a snack which I bought in the airport , and was told to stop eating because the airline does not permit any outside food and no water was offered on the flight. This is less than a budget airline! If you are connecting in Singapore, Scoot is actually a poor choice because it does not have a transfer/connecting counter inside terminal, which means you have to exit the terminal of arrival, goes through custom, collect your luggage and then check in again! You will  miss your flight if there is not 3 hours connecting time. Whereas other airlines have connecting counter inside terminal and you can easily transfer and check in.

However, still had to contend with the limited options of a low cost airline. The online booking process has many stages of options that one needs to wade through. The tally keeps growing until one reaches the end with a bill the size of one from a more comfortable airline. This is the only airline I've come across that offers  nothing included free. Baggage: We were travelling for one month so chose to add 20KG. Pleasingly they do include 10kg carry on. Scheduling: They arrived on time and left late due to no fault of their own they tell us. The thing we're really fed up about is the forced long wait at Changi. Three times this has been a feature of our flight. There never seems to be any short layovers. Of course this may just be the legs we are flying. Both legs of this trip required long (20-22 hours) waits at Changi. We spend $200-$300 each leg just trying to have a place to rest and eat. Again contributing to false economy. Food: In flight options are not clear for a person with food intolerances like myself. No food labelling. Not even water is provided free.

Their business class doesn't even have paper towels in the bathrooms - you can dry your hands on facial tissues. No blankets - unless you want to pay $15. (Oh, and though it's a Singapore based airline they charge for extras in USD - because they are bigger.) No entertainment - not even screens. Seats recline somewhat. Food varies from not bad to quite mediocre. Service is officious and rigid - even when there were only ten people in the business class cabin they couldn't bring themselves to be flexible on mealtimes. Everything is about the rules, nothing is about the passengers. I don't think that's the fault of the crew - it is probably the management. Trying to check in on line from Tokyo was impossible because the website - whether the JP website or the SIN website - only supplies Singapore as a point of departure, there are no other choices. Condescending - the pilot refers to the staff as ""our Scootees"" - as if they are owned property. It's basically a run-of-the-mill low-cost airlines with pretensions.

She  put the parents at ease and handled the situation in a most kind and professional manner. She also made it a point to talk to children on the flight and picked them up and took them for little walks whenever she saw the parent looking tired or the child looking restless.

Scoot had allowed me to change the passenger for the air ticket that I bought for my daughter. But due to unforeseen circumstances, she cannot join us in our family trip. I had to transfer the ticket to my niece. However, during the several telephone conversation, I have been told that the change fee is between S$80-S$100. However, when I tried to make the change online, I was told it would cost me $400, almost the price of the ticket itself! Plus there would also be a fare difference charge when there is no fare change, no change in date or time or selling away my existing ticket and rebuying another! The $400 change fee comprises S$100 for change of first name, another $100 for change of last name, multiply that by 2 for the return ticket! This is the most absurd charge and the airline refused to budge telling me its in their rule!. Firstly, the rule is absurd and secondly, during all the telephone exchanges, I have only been told it is between S$80-$100 and never $400! The discussion has been going on for 2 weeks now, but there has been no resolution. I feel that I have been held to ransom as I am due to depart in slightly more than a week. I have been using Scoot alot recently. But customer service, goodwill and ethical practice obviously has no place in Scoot's management! I will think doubly hard about ever using Scoot again.

I wanted to fly Thai Airways, however that wasn’t possible. On a timeline scale, I reserved an extra ticket for my Mum in business, as it was on sale at the time. It was only $200 on the first sector, so we brought it. It would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. Initially, I asked for an exit row, and got the best seat, 4J and 4H. However, the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. Once I got on board, the flight attendant at the door greets you,  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. I call the purser, and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. They then say that this was a double seat assignment and that I had to sit in row 15. The seat itself isn’t appealing, and some short haul aircraft have better seats. I could’ve paid extra for seats with extra legroom, but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in, and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. Luckily, the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. But the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse! The most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call button/light switch, awkwardly placed on the armrest. I understand the 787 doesn’t have call buttons on the ceiling, but can’t you find a better place for it? After takeoff, I order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. The lasagne tasted unappetising, while the pasta tasted really bland. A little bit later in the flight, I had Ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. All this food set me back 50 Singaporean dollars. The equivalent amount of food on AirAsia would only cost me a third as much, and also tastes better.  On the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, the staff at the check in were friendly like Japanese people are, and I requested an extra legroom seat, and found out I wouldn’t be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. However, my brother wasn’t allowed to sit there, so we asked if he was allowed to sit in The “ScootInSilence” zone, which he wasn’t allowed to, even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. There was a lady and her daughter talking in Japanese in the counter next to us, and later in the flight, I saw her and her daughter (who looked like she was 10) sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if I had a language barrier, even though the guy at the counter wasn’t Japanese. The crew on this flight were much more friendly, but still considerably cold. I went to have some conversation in the galley, and after 2 minutes of pleasant conversation they all had their backs turned on me. Scoot is a horrible choice and I would pay much more in order to be able to avoid it.

She then get another stewardess to help while still holding the tray of food. And when it was time to serve food to the rest of the passengers, the cart carrying food was being emptied and so a stewardess asked another stewardess to bring extra food to re-fill the card. The air steward bought 3 trays of food and simply just place it on the floor on the aisle. The tray of food was on the floor for a full 5-min before it was placed into the cart. Seriously?

From Singapore to Athens, the quality of service and the standard of the service was way below par. The air stewardesses do not know what they were doing, some told us that we could have free flow water, some then told us that actually they do not serve water unless we purchase. Thereafter when it came to meal time, the stewardesses were clearly unsure of what was on the menu, i.e. we were offered the choices of pumpkin or turkey wrap, but actually, it was a pumpkin and turkey wrap. As it was an overnight flight, we were woken up 4 hours before the arrival for our meals, which was a little annoying for some of us whom have given them instructions that we didnt want our meals. From Athens to Singapore, during check in, we realised that our first row seats were given away to customers who did a 150euro upgrade. It was unprofessional of this airline as we booked our seats way in advance, paid much more for our business class seats, and the walk-in customers whom came by the counters, decided to pay for the upgrade with simply 150 euro, and yet they could take our seats which we have chosen beforehand. And we can all foresee, the counter staff, ground staff etc all said they cant do anything about it. We sent in a feedback to Scoot and as we can all expect it, there wasnt any response from them. We met another passenger who also told us that Scoot just cancelled his flight.

At first they were only willing to give a travel voucher for a refund, now they are offering a refund but it will take 8 weeks to process. In the meantime we still have to purchase tickets to Athens at a premium price - a destination that we didn't need to fly into, we only decided to go that route to save money.

Was annoyed when I got to Singapore that we were flying Tiger, I thought we were flying Scoot. Before we returned I rang Scoot (was on hold and on the telephone call for just shy of 2 hours) to try and reinstate my meals. Scoot advised that I could not get a refund for the food not used on the first sector and now they could not guarantee any food on the return sector as was inside 72 hours. (I thought issue was resolved in Singapore on the way up), I was actually ringing to see why a seat hadn't been allocated out of Hong Kong for me as I had paid for it. I was advised that I had not paid for a seat. When we got to Singapore and was issued with boarding cards for the Singapore - Perth sector our seats were not where we had paid to sit. When I queried this, I was advised that ""we are just ground staff, we cannot do anything, and you will need to put it in writing"". I did this when I returned to Perth. Only to be advised by Scoot by email 2 weeks later that they were ""sorry for the inconvenience"" would give me a voucher for the value of 50 Singapore dollars (even thought on face value I paid $82 Singapore Dollars for each seat), and nothing was mention of the food that was not provided ($36.00).

Scoot uses Bangkok's older Don Mueang airport (DMK) which is slightly closer to the city centre than Suvarnabhumi airport and smaller which means a shorter trek between immigration and the boarding gates. I was not able to do an online check-in in BKK (which may not be an option out of BKK) but was able to do so for the return flight in SIN. I arrived at DMK about 90 mins before departure. There was barely any queues for check-in. After the online check-in in SIN, I was prompted to print my boarding pass which I did but there are many self-service stations near the Scoot check-in counters in Changi which prints the luggage tags and also issues boarding passes. Both flights departed on time and arrived at the destinations ahead of schedule even though the flight arriving into SIN was placed in a holding pattern for over 20 mins due to traffic in Changi. The plane from Bangkok to Singapore seems a little older with prominent carpet stains. The plane from Singapore was newer and somehow cleaner. Cabin crew were well trained and did several rounds of checks before departure and arrival. The level of detail to safety is not experienced even in some full service carriers. Announcements were clear and made in both English and Japanese. The seats have excellent recline which is way more generous than the other budget airlines I have flown on this route. Scoot flies the B787 which is my preferred plane compared to the other budget airlines which tend to fly single aisle planes for this route.

I like Scoot's 787 aircraft and the Economy class seats are some of the most comfortable around. For point to point travel they are a good deal, but I won't be using them for connecting flights again and here's why. Although Scoot will sell you an itinerary with connecting flights, the transit time can be very long. My original outbound schedule was changed such that it would have taken over 29 hours to arrive in Bangkok. I decided to connect in Singapore to another airline instead. Scoot does have a well-hidden policy for Australian travellers only, which allows for refunds in very limited circumstances - I did eventually get a partial refund on my flight, but only after I involved the Consumer Affairs authorities (and I still had to wait 10 weeks for the money). My return flight was a mere 17.5 hours elapsed, which was just about acceptable. But even though I had only carry on baggage, Scoot forced me to go through immigration in Singapore to get my onward boarding pass (after telling me in Bangkok that I could do this at the transfer desk). System limitations perhaps? Well no, if I had paid an extra $20 for ""Scoot-Thru"" they would have given me my boarding pass. Someone must have thought this was a great idea to make money out of customers, I think of it as a great way to lose customers. Another thing about connecting flights - according to the terms and conditions if you don't pay for Scoot-Thru and you miss your connection due to a delay by the airline, the airline won't help you at all - you've lost your flight! For the Singapore to Perth flight I paid THB970 for a ""super seat"". In extreme cases these seats can give you an extra 4 inches of leg room, but in my case it was only an extra 2 inches compared to my outbound flight - definitely not worth it. Speaking of extra expenses, the food is overpriced and awful. Vegetarian choices are particularly poor - and you're not allowed to bring your own. Scoot could have been a great airline, but by their mean-spirited practices they have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BKK,PER,SIN,January 2017,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4,no,Boeing 787-8 and Boeing 787-9,2.0

I complained and was told there was nothing they could do. I've also added up the money I save by the cheaper ticket, and with all the other hidden charges it would have been cheaper to fly with a better airline. Yes, they are a budget airline, but there are some things which shouldn't cost money, such as good service. When our plane was boarding, the staff were just talking to each other and a huge amount of people were confused and not even sure what was happening.

The baggage drop-off queue was about 100 persons long since there was only 1 staff-person attending that took 45 minutes of waiting which makes a mockery of doing on-line check-in. The cabin crew spoke poor and heavily accented English even for crucial announcements, and seemed flustered all the time - as when asked any question. They did nothing to stop a parent allowing a child to play with balloons which burst periodically sounding like a gun-shot. Nor did they stop another woman watching a kung-fu movie on her tablet computer without head-phones. By the time one adds the check-in luggage, meals and seat selection, the ticket costs as much as an SIA flight if booked a little earlier. Since they do not have the same facility to check luggage through to a connecting flight, one has to have the expense and inconvenience of entering a transit country immigration-wise just to collect luggage and check it in again when the other airline commenced check-in many hours later. So the parent company gets almost the same fare for an airline operating much cheaper and so makes a greater profit! Seems like the reason for having Scoot is to run it so poorly is to make SIA look better by contrast, and convince passengers pay the slightly higher fare. In compensation for the flight delay Scoot offered a trifling voucher to use on another flight in the near future - a highly unlikely scenario for most.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN,PER,,December 2016,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2,no,Boeing 787,

Service on the plane was decent, attendants treated us with good manners and respect, responded to requests promptly, and was generally very accommodating to the passengers. Plane delayed for 8 hrs at Narita, since Scoot didn't have arrangements with other airlines and we didn't receive the notification email before arriving, we had to sit at the check-in area for 4 hours before being allowed to go through security where we spent an additional 5 hours. Flight was scheduled for 7pm departure but by 6:45pm, the plane was nowhere to be seen, they change the departure time at 7pm, very poorly communicated. Meal vouchers were provided, which was a slight plus. Because Scoot uses one plane to fly through 4 different routes (Brisbane to Tokyo to Taipei to Singapore), delays at any of the locations would cause delays to all rest. On top of that, with the tight turnaround schedule, they had no time to clean the planes. The bathrooms were disgusting. The plane seats were dirty,  not exactly the new plane they had advertised. Greediness also comes to mind looking at how much they charged for water/drinks along with their policy of no food on-board. Carry-on luggage policy is what I had serious issues with. We carried on the same amount of luggage arriving to Taiwan as we did departing but we were told we needed to keep the carry-on weight at 10kg and below for each. Why wasn't this policy enforced from Tokyo to Taipei? Instead of taking everything out of our carry-on, we decided to check our luggage instead but then had to pay $20 per kg after 20kg, so additional $200 was paid for carry-on. To make it more infuriating, the overhead bins were empty on the plane, which means, they forced most passengers to check their carry-on. Seating, coming back from Taiwan, for our family of 4, 2 adults two kids 3 and 5, they decided to separate us and had us in different rows on different sides of the plane. Had the plane been completely booked, we would've been fine with it but there were at least 30+ seats available next to each other by the time we departed.

I wrote to Scoot feedback about this issue and they confirmed they run the cabin at 24c degrees. Once the sun streams in through the windows and there's no cool air in the cabin it feels a lot hotter. From this flight my mother got sick and she was unwell for the rest of our trip. I read all the negative reviews of Scoot but went into flying with them with an open mind but I couldn't ignore how uncomfortable flying with them is. Next the seats, after a few hours it feels like a metal bar is pushing into your lower back, I found them unbearable, the food wasn't much better. Because of this we changed carriers when we flew back and went Emirates, which after you add all the add ons on Scoot really wasn't much more expensive. It was like night and day - we had ventilation, the food was decent and the seats comfortable . Why do Scoot run the cabins so hot and why no ventilation. These are basic needs of human comfort.

It was our first time so we did not realise the biz class seats did not recline much and the leg rest also did not come up. We bought biz cos we thought we would get a better rest on the redeye but instead, passengers in economy were able to take 2-3 seats and lie down while there is a non-movable handrest between the biz seats and my toddler couldn't lie on my lap so ended up being even more uncomfortable. I brought packet oats for my toddler and wanted just a bowl of hot water but even that could not be accommodated. I guess this is budget but I don't know what biz class I was paying for. On the return flight, we missed the cutoff for the checkin counter by 5 min, that is clearly our bad as we didn't know it was 1 hour cutoff (In Singapore mostly 40 min) but what annoyed was the scoot counter staff attitude. It's tough for anyone to miss their flights but they were really mean and rude about it. I then realised the Economy class passengers for this flight were still being checked in and asked why we couldn't then get on but she said its because we were not already in the queue by the 1 hour mark. So it wasn't like the counter had closed which I would fully understand but just for the principle of it. This inflexibility really put me off. Next she tells me too bad, the tickets are non-refundable (we paid $2700 for the 3 tickets - not exactly cheap cos i wrongly thought biz class was worth it). They had no scoot counter at the airport and there is no wifi at the airport. So I had to make multiple long-distance calls to find out tomorrow's flight would cost be another $2k. At this point, I gave up and opted to buy 3 new full-fare ticket on SIA from Brisbane airport. It was a mistake to fly Scoot. Should have just flown a return flight on SIA from the get-go.

At DMK no early check in available, no dedicated Scoot Biz check in lane, but I asked and was shown to a check in counter immediately. DMK-SIN Boeing 787 has only 3 rows of business class but the seats are bigger and have more recline than economy class, but were hard as concrete. As I had 11 hours waiting in SIN for the connection I decided to pay extra for lounge access, they call it ‘scoot in style’. They use the SATS lounge which is very old and tired lounge, uninterested staff, uncomfortable seats, very limited snacks - the only redeeming feature was a shower, so refreshing for the next flight was helpful. SIN-PER was another Boeing 787 but with 6 rows of business class, same hard seats. The only highlight of the trip was both meals (beef) were quite good, not usually expected with discount airlines.

Bought the fares on a sale, and even with fees with checked-in luggage, it was about half the cost of a full-service airline. The seats were fantastic - especially for a low cost airline. According to Seatguru economy seats were a generous 18""-19"" wide. This is wider than many full-service airlines. Practically speaking, this could mean a difference between being able to tuck your elbows between the seat handles (instead of clashing with your neighbour's elbow) or not. Leg room was also adequate, although I am shorter than average (5'8""). The ScootBiz seat was, obviously, much more comfortable. But note that it is a Premium Economy, rather than Business offering. It involved reclining wide seats but added utility is limited because the leg rest awkwardly stops mid-calf and cuts off your circulation after a while. The major let-downs were twofold. Firstly, the appalling attitude the ground and especially call centre staff. After talking to them I felt like they were doing me a huge favour by allowing me to fly on Scoot. I get that it's a budget airline, but it doesn't cost much (if at all) to be slightly more courteous. The second is the food. You are not allowed to bring your own food, and you need to buy theirs. Not surprisingly, food is not cheap. But unfortunately, the Nasi Lamak I got was greasy and salty. Bottom line: if you're a budget traveller, they are nevertheless solid.

A day before our flight, my daughter said she might need an extra luggage so I went to the Scoot website ""Manage My Booking"" Section to purchase an extra luggage allowance. It took me half an hour to get to my booking details because the website could not find my booking reference. Finally after getting to my flight details, I added an extra 10kg on top of my luggage allowance of 20kg and paid $34. I also paid $24 to book our seat numbers. I tried to add meals in our booking but the website said meal booking was not available at that moment. Finally on the day of our departure, 15th January 2016, we went to Sydney airport and the check in guy said our luggage was over the 20kg allowance and I said I booked an extra 10kg the night before. They said there was no extra 10kg booked in our flight and that I have to pay $140 extra for the excess weight. I asked them to double check because I know I paid for it the night before. The woman said they see an extra 10kg booking for our return flight. I asked there was a mistake and if they could fix that problem and apply the extra 10kg allowance for this flight. The woman said in a firm tone there's nothing they can do, I have to pay the extra $140.  Before boarding  we bought a couple of bottled water and after take off I pulled a bottle water out of our carry bag but the flight attendant told us we are not allowed to consume any food or drinks we have with us. I said my daughter is thirsty and the flight attendant told us we have to buy water from them which cost $4 for a very small bottle of water, and we waited for at least 15 mins for the bottled water to be given us. An hour after later, the flight attendants started serving meals to those who were successful in booking their meals. I asked one of the flight attendants if I could buy food and she said we have to wait. We waited for more than half an hour before she came to take our order.

I highly recommend these. There was plenty of space to the side of the window seat to place books etc. I found the staff pleasant and flights were punctual. I can't comment on the food as I didn't try it but the on-board Wi-Fi was very impressive. Reasonably priced (about £8 for 3 hours if I remember correctly) which kept me entertained. Only negative was the placement of the lighting/attendant buttons on the armrests. Proper design issue there I think. The lack of entertainment was expected so I can't complain but it's probably the only factor that differentiates it negatively from a full service carrier.

However, instead of listening to what they were saying patiently, a stewardess just rolled her eyes which was rude. My family and I are vegetarians so we had bought some food in the airport to eat in the plane. We have done this before during traveling. However, the steward told us outside food was not allowed and so we told them this time we had already brought the food and we wouldn't do it next time while traveling.

2015-12-07,5,United States,,"""great Business Class rates""","For a recent business trip, I found Scoot which offered some great Business Class rates for locations that I travel to regularly and decided to give them a try. Because of route limitations (Narita to Hong Kong), I had to piece my flight together by purchasing each leg individually. While purchasing my flights, I found that even though the basic airfares offered are the same as those sold on other travel websites, it is not obvious until you have completed your initial order that everything else is ""a la carte"" with regards to cost. Since I fly Singapore Air regularly, it was nice that an option to count my Scoot flight on my Kris Flyer account, it was ridiculous that I have to pay extra for this feature ($20-$30 extra). But there are a number of things that Scoot's website either fails to disclose, is not well worded or has hidden on some obscure page on their site requiring hours of searching. One items it that their online check in is only available for flights DEPARTING from Singapore. Additionally, I suggest making sure to double and triple check your travel dates and times since their website did not provide me with a flight on the date and time of day that I had requested (requested Fri evening, was giving FRI AM past midnight schedule instead of making it Sat AM past midnight). For the HK to Singapore leg, I found that Scoot offered a nice comfortable ride, fast boarding (Business Class) and fairly good service from the flight crew. Scoot is definitely an all economy airline since additional beverages beyond what was included with the meal were offered even for purchase. Speaking of the meal, unless you like eating what is similar to cheap frozen microwave meals, I suggest as others have mentioned to bring your own food along. Also the flight crew do not remove the plastic cover before serving you so make sure to drape your napkin across your clothes to avoid splattering yourself. At least the flight crew were nice and friendly and were dressed like flight crew's from the 50's and 60's which was a nice change from the stuffy or garish looking uniforms that other airlines use. As for my Singapore to Narita flight, this is when I learned that Scoot's website made an error with my flight request. Like I noted previously, I had requested for a flight on Friday afternoon or evening specifically and did not realize that it had offered me a flight just past midnight on Thursday evening instead of Saturday. So this is where things got really interesting. First, based on the way the website was worded when I attempting to login and make a flight change 2 days before hand that the site said I could not make any changes until 24 hours before my scheduled flight. So I waited and tried to make the change 24 hours before my flight but was still not allowed to do so. Well like any other traveler, I decided to just call and have the change made over the phone - only to my surprise to learn that I was marked a ""No Show"" because the flight I had paid for had already boarded and was about to depart. Unlike other airlines, the Scoot rep rudely told me that the error was my fault and that their policy was to not refund the cost of the flight especially since I was now marked as a ""No Show"" and became argumentative, so Customer Service is definitely not a strong feature for Scoot.",Business,Business Class,Singapore,Narita,,November 2015,4.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,3,no,Boeing 787,

Starting with the booking process, you get the promise of a big seat (not a lay-flat such as AirAsia), free seat allocation, 20 or 30kg of luggage and a premium meal. The meal was terrible - probably the worst airline food I've had. Starting a bit early at Changi airport - we were told bluntly that early check-in would be additional cost - even for Scoot Biz.  Neither is internet and depending on what you read - even the streaming entertainment. Once onboard, I found the extra-large seat to be hard as a rock and only reclined a bit - not enough for a comfortable sleep. Yes, it was better than economy seating, but not much. And after 5 hours of flying, a request for a 100ml cup of water was denied - the Scootie insisting that I had to pay for drinks.

2015-10-21,2,Singapore,,"""no more Scoot for me""","Seoul Incheon to Singapore via Taipei. Scoot flight was fairly uncomfortable for me both to and fro. The seats were stiff and uncomfortable, there were no meals provided for 8 hour flights, they had to be purchased separately. The flight back from Korea was delayed for 2 hours, everyone who had to detour in Taipei was stuck for 2 hours and this was in the midnight 1-3am. I felt very sorry for a little girl who was extremely tired but since we arrived late from the Korea flight there were no seats left at the waiting area in Taipei so she had to sleep on the ground with her bag under her head. Both times I boarded the flight, both arrived late. No compensation was offered and the pilot claimed it was due to Taipei's runway being closed. Personally, I did not feel that the announcement sounded apologetic, it seemed more like an excuse to me. Afterall, the flight was already an hour late upon arrival in Taipei so clearly whatever the runway issues were the late arrival had nothing to do with it. A more comprehensive view of all the problems with my trip with Scoot. It was booked by my company therefore I was not given the choice to pick. When I checked the itinerary the first thing that alerted me was no 25kg check-in baggage. My boss' secretary booked it and when I asked she mentioned she did not know it was not provided because she assumed that all international flights would include it. Therefore, we had to pay for the baggage which eventually summed up to cost even more than Vietnam Airlines which already included the baggage fees (I did a price comparison on my own). I was sent on a two week business trip which required me to ship a laboratory equipment back. Another problem cropped up when I was supposed to ship the parcel back. I was paged by one of the airline personnel to the boarding gate. She informed me that the parcel has been detained because it does not fit the airline regulations. Firstly, like all the other normal, regular people, I do not read all the airline regulations although I have a rough understanding of what is allowed and what isn't. This knowledge obviously does not comprise of laboratory equipment and other aspects which are uncommon to be brought on board - if there was a problem they should have alerted me during the check-in of my bag, not when I am about to board a plane. The staff then told me I have to leave the equipment behind. She was pretty rude, trying to shove her piece of airline regulation in my face telling me that the specifications for the equipment exceeds those of the airline regulations. I am not Korean and the manufacturer's description were in Korean. I told her to open it and read it herself and I have no problem with that. She told me they already did and I just cannot check this in. She did not give me any solutions to my dilemma. What I got from her was basically, ""Miss, the airline does not allow us to take this on board, so please just dump it here and get on your flight."" I was obviously very annoyed by this as I had paid for the excess baggage. So I told her if the baggage is now left behind, I should at least be refunded for my baggage fees. She gave me a downright no. There was no effort being put into trying to make the customer happy. She didn't even offer to ask.

It's not the inedible food. No, it's the staff. I flew Scoot within a month of their first flight and they were genuinely trying. Now, they have all become SIA wannabes, following the rules with slavish zeal. I don't mind when there is at least the intention to improve my safety. I got used to being told to put my seat upright when still at 40,000ft, etc. And it is just amusing that none of the staff can pronounce ""Let's get outta here"", without it sounding like ""customers go away"". But yesterday, I arrived at DMK airport in Bangkok 56 mins before the departure time to be told, along with a bunch of other disappointed customers, that the check in desk was already closed. No amount of pleading would get the man with the walkie talkie to waver from the script, despite there being plenty of time to clear through. With Bangkok's traffic, I can imagine this is going to happen quite often. This cost me two additional airport taxis, a night in a hotel and a new one-way ticket (with another airline).

The seats are narrow - about 43-45cm but having three allowed me to snooze quite comfortably and better than in what is euphemistically called 'business class' with minimal recline and those horrible large non retractable armrests. Why would anyone waste an extra A$200 plus one way for less comfort? Staff were friendly but the design of the light and call buttons (and 'cancel call' button) in the armrest meant they frequently went to seats where passengers had mistakenly pressed it. Which designer thought of this? The meals are horribly expensive and a small icecream (we'd call it a 'buddy' in Australia) was an extortionate A$6. I brought my own water filled at Sydney Airport after passenger screening: a small Evian bottle on board was an outrageous A$4 with no free tap water available.

For this, no announcements were made for obvious reasons - the jetway soon became crowded. 6 airport security personnel were brought in. Cups of water were handed out to make the delay more bearable. The aircraft departed about 90 mins late. To add insult to injury, baggage was delayed in Singapore by 2 hours due to lightning risk. No representative from SCOOT was present to provide assistance or updates. Passengers had to wait clueless of how long the delay was going to last. This despite SCOOT extremely steep baggage fees. SCOOT's basement fares translate into rock-bottom service, which can make the experience extremely painful if things don't go as planned.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok,Singapore,,August 2015,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,no,Boeing 777-200,

If you pay for a meal, it is atrocious even by airline standards. Basic things like check in from the city of origin to destination if you need a transfer in SIN are not included - there is a fee (marketed as Scoot-Thru) if you do not want to go through customs. I took two trips with them (one “Business” – read premium economy) and one economy, and have had surprises on both. The latest was not being able to check in online from Hong Kong.

2015-06-28,1,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"Having flown Business Class on International routes with other airlines, we thought that Scoot Biz may be good value for money. Bear in mind we assumed Biz was short for Business. Instead of Business Class it was Business Farce. We had to pay extra to use the lounge and were told at the check-in desk to go to Singapore Airlines Business lounge - not so! Singapore Airlines wouldn't even admit Scoot Biz passengers, but instead referred us to another lower market lounge. The seats only reclined 8 inches and the leg support did nothing. I asked for 2 pillows to support my back and was told I had to pay for them. That was when the staff told me that it was not Business Class but Premium Economy. The meal supplied was the same as you get on any Economy Class flight with other airlines. Only one drink supplied for the 7 hour flight.

The schedule suited us exactly as it allowed us overnight in Singapore to catch up with friends. The flight left on time but due to strong head winds we arrived in Singapore a little bit late.  Biz class is good value especially if you buy on promo and we were glad to have  the extra leg room for that 8 hour flight. We booked aisle seats in the middle, so got an empty seat between us. Plenty of room to move about. We had the upgraded meals That was worth the extra compared to the normal meals we saw served. Scoot offers a free drink of your choice as part of the meal. Water was available free any time. We took our snacks onboard and there wasn't a mention from any staff about that. Then again, the snacks made no mess. We used Scoot in style at Singapore airport. Incidentally we used Krisflyer points to get a Scoot voucher and used the voucher to pay the  Scoot in Style upgrade after making our booking. You need to do all that on the website beforehand. It worked perfectly. So we arrived at check-in 3 hours ahead of the Bangkok flight and got about 2 full hours in the SATS lounge. It was worth it as you can eat and drink a lot during 2 hours! The Bangkok flight was pretty full as it was a public holiday, but Biz class was ok. Again we were offered any drink to go with our upgraded meal.  We got a seat between us empty. It was a good quality experience, I'd do it again any time. Behind us was the quiet cabin with no children.

I flew on a flash sale fare without any add-ons or checked luggage making my flights worth the money.

Knowing that there was no entertainment we had a book and magazines to read and had a snooze. We bought subway at the airport and took it on board to eat. The flight attendant told us it was not allowed but to quickly eat it - which we did. We had no issues with the seats the flight was early arriving into Perth which we were pleased about.

2015-05-13,2,Australia,,Scoot customer review,I was on the very first flight out of the Gold Coast to Singapore and felt compelled to write this review. Originally it was a great service with great customer service but all seems to have changed. The seats are uncomfortable the staff are unhelpful and the overhead light and crew call button is on the seat arm and keeps coming on due to just resting your arm on the arm rest. It is cold on all flights I have been on probably to get the passengers to buy Scoot blankets. My daughter recently flew to Singapore and her credit card didn't work for some strange reason. She only had a Travelex card and no cash which meant she was unable to purchase any food or drink. This is not a major problem but just inconvenient. What was deeply concerning was that the crew refused to let her have a glass of water for the whole 7+ hours! I have found the food to be unhealthy and average considering they are not charging insignificant amounts for any of it. Another word of advice is never change your flight unless you have to! They basically charge you almost the same again to change dates. It feels very much as though they have come up with a great concept and then decided to take advantage of any need such as food water warmth and entertainment and charge for it whilst providing the bare minimum of comfort. Like most airlines they even charge you a processing fee for the convenience of paying them. There is no other way to pay so they are guaranteed income from this. Then they have the add on's such as car hotel insurance and so it goes on! Overall an airline that has a great route from the Gold Coast to Singapore seems to have unfortunately turned into an uncomfortable and unreasonable airline. I will use the service in future due to convenience but not look forward to it as I have in the past! Incidentally I would have given them high scores on all aspect in the beginning except for perhaps the food. It may be better to just get the train to Brisbane and fly out from there in future.,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no,,
2015-05-08,6,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,"TZ6 Singapore - Gold Coast on 777. Seats were hard felt very comfortable mid-way through the flight even though I have short legs. The reading lights kept coming on as we ""hit"" the light buttons located on the side of the arm- rest as we turned to relief body stiffness due to the discomfort of the seat. We sat 3 in a row and ordered the premium meal. I noticed mine was the biggest portion of 3. One of the portions was noticeably lesser probably about 85% of mine. There was a water point providing basic drinking water or you had the option to purchase bottled water. This is our first time flying with Scoot. Other than the uncomfortable seat overall it was OK for me and I will probably fly Scoot again. Looking forward to my return flight TZ5 on the Dreamliner. TZ5 Gold Coast - Singapore. Dreamliner seat was so much more comfortable. The soft and creative lighting makes it very pleasant. The windows shades also helps to create a soothing ambience. I like the sensor toilet flush wash basin tap and auto water drain - so much more convenient. It is sad that with such an updated and modern plane there was no drinking water point provided and basic drinking water had to be purchased. The reading light is now located on top of the arm rest and it keeps coming on as we rest our arms on the handle. Our pre-booked premium meal on this return trip was served without the Haagen Dazs ice cream. After we asked about the missing ice-cream we were given a bar of Toblerone chocolate and were informed that our meals come with Toblerone instead of Haagen Dazs. Naturally we were disappointed that we did not get what we have paid for. Will I travel with Scoot again? Yes so long as I do not need to buy basic drinking water on board and I get my meals purchased. If Scoot cannot deliver the meals purchased online they need to reconsider their model of not allowing outside food and drinks on board. There was a meal change after I booked my ticket and meal. I don't take beef. Luckily the change did not put beef on the table for me. Otherwise I will stay hungry despite having booked my meals.",,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,4,yes,,
2015-05-05,7,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,TZ2-TZ1 (SYD-SIN). My previous experience with their 777s were not so great especially the seats which were as hard as rock. However they have changed to the new 787 Dreamliner since then and I had a much better experience this time. Food was below average the portion still wasn't able to fill my hungry stomach. However the seats on the 787 had much better cushion and more legroom. I realized that you don't need an IFE if you are willing to pay US$30 to surf the Internet for the entire trip and a bit extra for power if you are running out of battery (though I didn't see anyone paying that in economy). The only reason IFE still exists is when you don't have access to Internet or your phone. If you don't really care about travel prestige not having hot towels and complimentary toiletries is fine willing to eat before you board and is trendy enough to substitute IFE for Internet access then you can get a really good deal out of this airline which consistently offers half the ticket price of legacy airlines over long-haul routes.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,5,yes,,

For some reason they revved up the left engine to full blast when the plane was parked and then throughout the flight that engine's rev level was continually and dramatically going up and down.

Because my husband is in a motorised wheelchair we arrived early and paid $5pp for an early check in to avoid any hassles. The staff member at check in was extremely helpful and changed our seating from 42 H & J to 23 B & C to be closer to the exit and toilets. On our arrival to the departure lounge we were approached by an employee with a manual wheelchair and he told my husband to get in it! We explained several times to him that the wheelchair was unsuitable and that a smaller chair was necessary to get him on the plane. We finally got on board the plane and they took the small wheelchair off the plane! I asked ""How will my husband get to the toilet if there's no wheelchair on board the plane?"". The fellow from the departure gate got into an argument with the stewardess and we understood that he was telling her that she and the other stewardesses would have to carry him to the toilet which was approximately 20ft (6metres) away! My husband told the fellow that he was too heavy for them to carry him! Eventually other male passengers agreed to carry him. A few minutes later the staff member demanded I disconnect the battery on the wheelchair! I told him several times that it was disconnected. By this time both my husband and I and were getting very upset. A few minutes later the departure lounge man came back and said ""Good news the wheelchair is on board because it's a dry cell battery"".

2015-04-08,7,Australia,,Scoot customer review,March 2015 Gold Coast to Singapore to Taipei and return with stopover. Be prepared and read the fine print as if you don't expect anything other than what they say you won't be disappointed! The flight was very cheap and absolutely no frills - no pillows blankets tea or coffee included. They are clear about this on their website any extras have to be paid for. Do not expect staff to be there to look after you although I found them all to be pleasant and polite. The food did not look to be worth buying we took sweets and small snacks for the kids and were not questioned on this although customers in front of me were asked to put their own food away. There was a free drinking water dispenser near the toilets on all the planes we travelled on but you had to go and get this yourself in your own bottle or cup. The seats were reasonable (except for the dreadful position of the call button). They like to board the planes really early so be prepared for that. We left on time each flight with one major upset with one flight where 2 hours from Singapore to Taipei we had to turn back to Singapore due to a medical issue with a passenger on board. I was surprised we did not even get a free cup of tea after what was ultimately a 5 hour delay - beyond their control admittedly but some recognition of the inconvenience would have been appropriate. Another delay due to weather when leaving Taipei was affecting all aircraft so once again frustrating but not their fault. No problems with baggage at all and although a very slow check in at Gold Coast Changi and Taoyuan check ins were a breeze. Did saving around $4000 in fares for a family of 5 make up for the inconveniences of the flight? Absolutely!

It appears however that I may well have been very lucky. The value for money is excellent but if you can afford it then certainly fly with a full service carrier.

Catering was very disappointing. We pre-ordered wraps for lunch and these came with a drink. Wraps were as tasty as cardboard and drink was choice of coke or green jasmine tea in a can. We did not want either drink and asked if we could have water replacement. Completely surprising answer was that this was not possible with pre- ordered meals. We then thought we would buy something alcoholic - beer was warm so we decided on the wine. Decided on a white and then discovered that this was also warm.

No hot towel or wipe onboard. One meal only consisting of a small dish that would not feed an adult and a Toblerone. One drink of water in the entire flight one other drink with my meal. InFlight Entertainment nil unless one happens to have an iPad). No blanket or pillow. Scoot has managed to cut costs so much that they are falsely advertising the ‘biz’ class as something worth paying extra for but in fact it is even below economy in normal airlines. I was particularly appalled that they do not provide water on demand especially on the longer flights.

The entertainment streaming was unavailable on our flight which made the 5 hour journey seem quite long and tiring. The return flight was delayed 4 hours which totally interfered with our plans and cost us dearly for additional airport drinks and long term parking. We were bussed along with all other passengers to the plane which was still being repaired when we boarded.,,Business Class,,,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,,
2014-09-06,10,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Just flew Coolangatta - Singapore return Scoot Biz for the third time in two years and as usual excellent for the cost. Flight left and arrived on time both ways cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food is pretty ordinary but have never eaten anything worth talking about on any airline in 50 years of flying. Cabin is clean and seats comfortable excellent value for money. People who complain really need to look at what their saving.,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,5,yes,,
2014-08-28,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Flew TZ7 Perth to Singapore 18th August and returned TZ8 25th August. Medical emergency onboard during the outward journey meant we returned to Perth. Cabin crew were First Class in their handling of the situation. It was our first flight with Scoot and we were more than happy with the flight and service once resumed. We selected yellow seats in the quiet zone a good decision as we are both tall and the extra leg room made for a comfortable journey. The return trip was good also. Last year we did a trip to Japan using Malaysian Airlines and were less than impressed with the service. Their only redeeming factor was a 30kg baggage allowance. On balance we would fly with Scoot again if we could.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2014-08-08,10,United Kingdom,,Scoot customer review,Fly every few months from Bangkok to Singapore using Scoot the service is always excellent boarding is always on time check in is always easy and most importantly they're always the cheapest airline I can find even when other airlines have promotions Scoot are cheaper. As expected food is expensive and there's little in-flight entertainment apart from Wi-fi (which I got free!) but it's a low cost airline I don't expect it. I just bring a book or iPad. I always fly with Scoot and always recommend Scoot.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2014-08-08,4,Australia,,Scoot customer review,I booked Scoot for my sister and son SYD to SIN return. Whilst the outgoing flight was smooth and they were allowed to take their snacks on board on the return flight they were not even allowed to bring food/water onboard and being strict vegetarians it was tough as Scoot does not serve/sell anything that is purely vegetarian. The crew were rude and did not pay attention to anyone trying to call them. The tiny bottle of water sold on the plane - $4. A rip-off since they do not allow you to take water on board.,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no,,

2014-06-25,5,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Singapore to Sydney on June 16 the 1.45am flight. We booked bizclass and were very disappointed. The seats were most uncomfortable and the cabin was extremely cold for a night flight having not flown with Scoot before we didn't get any blankets or pillows so we were unable to sleep. For bizclass we got small water and pringles and a soft drink plus our ordered meal at 8am in the morning. We did not feel we got value for money.

We have sat on both standard (Blue) and Super (Yellow) seats and both were comfortable and have very spacious legroom (I could cross my legs with a standard seat). Cabin crew were very friendly and always served us quickly with a smile on their faces. We ordered a Beef Bourguignon Pasta Stew and some snacks on board and despite the small portion the meal was delicious.

2014-06-25,8,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Flew Scoot flight TZ7 from Perth to Singapore on 23/06/14. The aircraft was Goin'Scootin the crew were very fast to serve food and were very friendly. The captain however made announcements far too softly. We did not choose our seats and got super seats for free which have more legroom compared to the blue seats. However the seat was not cushioned and was quite hard the flight was quite bumpy so we did not feel relaxed at all. The food served onboard was very expensive but was needed for a 5hr flight.

You might realise that the blue seats are actually cleaner than the yellow seats which have stains. Pilots were very experienced and Scoot was actually a new airline so we were surprised that there was actually Senior first officers. Service from the ""Scootees"" were actually quite fast but they serve food rather slowly. Their English was actually quite nice but sounds unusual.

2014-05-17,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"Gold Coast Airport to Singapore. My friends had previously travelled on this flight and recommended I purchase the extra ""Yellow"" Stretch seats from Rows 21-25. Definitely do this! It cost me $66 extra but was it worth it! I'm close to 6 foot tall so the extra legroom was worth it alone. Food wise I played it safe and ordered the Ham/Cheese croissant and that was fine. I agree that a can of coke and small pringles is not the best ""health"" option but I bought my own food on board and there was no problem with that. Take an empty water bottle to refill. Don't try and take the bottled water through Gold Coast Customs - no go so you'll have to stand there and scull it! Scoot staff were fine and efficient. I can relate to the call button being ""dinged"" continuously due to the major design flaw of where the button is located on the armrest. All up I paid $745 back in January for this airfare and I am happy to do it again - but only in the yellow seats! The layout is 3-4-3 in economy and there were so mighty ""squashed"" people in those seats so invest the extra $70 (and hope that no one has the middle seat!). I agree with other reviewers that this section (Rows 21-25) is child-free and feels like your own little section. Gold Coast Airport Customs/Immigration is certainly not set up to cope with 3-4 International flights arriving at the same time definitely a poor ""first impression"".",,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,

2014-02-26,8,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"We have just returned to Sydney from Singapore after a marvellous three-week holiday flying both ways with Scoot. Being a budget-type airline we had no high expectations and were satisfied with both journeys: Sydney to Singapore and Singapore to Sydney. On our forward journey we had chosen the economy blue seats 38A and 38B - and we had a passenger sitting near us on 38C. Found it very cramped. Decided to upgrade for the return journey to the yellow seats and must say that the extra room was well worth the extra payment. I would travel again with Scoot – next time booking the super economy (yellow) seats. With such low air fares you get what you pay for so we can't whinge about being offered coca cola and pringles as a snack! The meal on the return journey (beef wrap) was a huge improvement on the forward journey which was some sort of very ordinary rice concoction. The staff at every step of the way - from when we checked in until we landed were very efficient and courteous. In recommending this airline I would suggest that potential passengers do a bit of homework beforehand and choose a seat that maximises their comfort. The small cabin directly behind business class (rows 21 to 23) are excellent as it is a small cabin which has been declared ""child and baby free"" - so no screaming babies directly nearby. Hope this has been helpful.",,Economy Class,,,,,0.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2014-02-24,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Our second trip with Scoot to Singapore. One out of Sydney and the latest from the Gold Coast. We aren't exactly the youngest passengers on flights (60's) so the blue seats get a bit (lot) cramped after takeoff plus an hour. This time we splurged and got yellow seats in the back of the plane. Also ordered a meal. Everything worked well and the meals were exactly what is/are required on an 8 hour flight. The small extra cost for the seats was well spent as we were in a bracket of two (window and aisle) and it was only the two of us to sprawl across each other. The cabin crew was/were really good. Spoke good English and didn't seem to be troubled by the usual few fools that adorn every flight! I'd certainly fly Scoot again. Next time to Hong Kong. If I can get a decent Gold Coast to Hong Kong connection. Check-in at the Gold Coast was fast and efficient. Same at Changi. Tip. Take your own Tablet device loaded with your fave TV or Movies. Yep. The battery will expire before the flight lands but by then you will be ready for a few hours of sleep. Also take an empty 500/600ml water bottle on board. Fill it at the water places on the aircraft.,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2014-02-19,1,Australia,,Scoot customer review,I was scheduled to travel on a non-stop Scoot flight from Singapore to Sydney by Business Class a few days ago. The flight was scheduled to take off from Singapore at 1.45am and arrive into Sydney at 12.40pm. The flight got progressively delayed and finally took off around 5.30am. Then for some unknown reason it stopped in Perth before continuing to Sydney. Finally it landed in Sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. I missed my onward connections to Canberra. So moral of the story is that if you have to reach somewhere on time do not travel by Scoot as they are usually late.,,Business Class,,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no,,
2014-02-17,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Have flown with Scoot several times and the planes have been on time and arrived early in some occasions all smooth with check in and bag collection as good as any airline I've used for this. Scoot Biz are much better than any standard seat with other airlines. Food is a bit basic but for the same price as the cheapest fare in economy with 38 inch legroom it's with it. The entertainment does not seem to work on my own devices which is probably the only downside. Overall a good service and will keep using if the price is right.,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,5,yes,,
2014-02-14,3,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,The aircraft was ok and service was almost the same as other budget airlines. However it was delayed 3 hours and 2 hours+ respectively for my 2 flights. I felt uncomfortable that the cabin crew moved my luggage without asking for my consent. The cabin crew are rude they don't give way to passengers when they are selling food and beverages. I stood in the aisle and waited for 10 mins until one moved his cart back a little and I could go back to my seat. Although it is a budget airline they should know we are the customers and they should provide quality service not a budget.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,3,no,,
2014-02-03,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Perth to Singapore - Scootbiz. Overall a good product check in very efficient through dedicated Biz desk young man was very friendly and professional he also mentioned we could board the plane as soon as boarding begins. Unfortunately no option to purchase Business Lounge Access at Perth. Boarding was efficient with a call to all Scoot biz to board at the start excellent much improved on last time. Boarded the cabin to realise there were only 4 people of the 32 seat occupied in the Biz section as always we were greeted warmly when boarding the plane. Drink orders were taken before take off and we were allowed any drink on their menu something not offered on our previous trip so improving all the time opted for Singapore slings we were told we would get these after take off. As with Biz we were provided with a small sealed cup of water like you get in economy take off was earlier than expected which I was impressed with. It was about 30 minutes after we took off when we were provided with our pre ordered meal not bad with small can of pringles and a bottle of pre mixed Singapore sling with a cup of ice overall good for budget maybe disappointing for any other service. Once again we were unable to use the entertainment system this time using a tablet instead of a laptop but once again no luck. We rarely saw the cabin staff and they did not come out and give us the code to access the entertainment. Scoot need to look at this as I don't think I'm the only one to have this issue. My favourite part of the experience is the seat its like premium economy comfortable with 38 inch leg room and 20inch width great for a 5 hour flight. Overall its a Premium economy cabin with a budget service.,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes,,
2014-01-25,5,Australia,,Scoot customer review,PER-SIN. Left on time cabin staff actually very good. This trip was better than some full service airlines. Problem in seat 15 - no overhead bin available due to Emergency oxygen and cabin stores and way the divider is set up also blanks out two other bins. Food was able to be eaten (just) and not worth the cost. Scoot should be taken to task as no android service of any kind. The 777's have a better feel up the front than say A320. Seat comfortable wide and lots of leg room in Biz. Excellent cabin staff. Cabin heat was rather hot announcements very hard to hear and garbled.

2014-01-21,3,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Gold Coast to Singapore December 23rd 2013. Singapore to Gold Coast January 7th 2014. If you want a budget airline with no frills substandard food at premium prices that charges you every time you blink then this airline is for you. I can understand extra for food drinks (even water) entertainment but to charge you for checking in early is a pathetic money grabbing option. Only $5 but no mention of fee at early check-in sign at airport after queuing in line for 20 minutes and many complaints from other passengers a staff member came from behind the counter to tell you of the charge when you are two passengers from the counter and by the time we got to the counter we were only 5 minutes early. However the aircraft was clean seat comfortable (just a little narrow) but plenty of legroom.

2014-01-20,7,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Traveled PER-SIN only. The ground staff were nice enough to ask if I wanted a window seat or aisle seat during check in. Boarding went pretty quickly. The crew were helpful with my carry-on luggage on board. There were some problems with the passenger call bell button and it was quite worrying. (Probably just an old aircraft. The seats looked old and dirty but overall very spacious and comfortable. The cabin seemed warm and stuffy throughout the flight though). Safety and budget transportation was definitely the main focus of the airline. In safety aspects the crew did their seatbelt checks after the turbulence announcement and constantly doing toilet-checks and house-keeping often. Announcements by the crew could be improved in terms of clarity audibility and tone of voice. I did not try the inflight entertainment and purchase any meals. But the menu of the inflight meals and the list of inflight entertainment seemed interesting and a bit on the steep side. However definitely use this airline again because of the price and comfort.,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,4,yes,,
2014-01-20,8,United Arab Emirates,,Scoot customer review,SIN-PER-SIN. Both flights were on time we paid to choose our seats (basic ones) and got them. We filled our bottles with water prior to boarding and carried with us some burgers and snacks. Although they announce that food purchased from outside is not allowed to be consumed many people have a bite and no one says anything - I would recommend this option over purchasing the inflight food especially as many people have said that it is not good. We watched our own movies on our iPad so entertainment wasn't an issue either. Safety measures were taken very seriously and the cabin crew were responsive when they were called for. I would definitely recommend this airline it does what it says on the tin and at a very decent price. If you want all the frills and creature comforts beyond a nice seat safety and being on time don't go for it.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,5,yes,,

Offered ScootBiz upgrade which supposedly included unlimited drinks during meal service and a blanket. This was not the case and we got nothing but a better seat for our $169! Customer service has done nothing. Boarding took forever as ground staff were incompetent with only one staff member. I understand you get what you pay for but this airline doesn't even offer that!

2014-01-15,5,Australia,,Scoot customer review,6-10th Jan. PER-SIN-PER. Service in the cabin was non-existent I couldn't get anyone to come to my seat with my service light on for hours I gave up. Both flights there and back were cold particularly the outbound flight. The aircon was broken it was freezing and we weren't offered different seats even though there were many available that were much warmer. Eventually given a free blanket hours later. The sorting out of pre-booked meals is stupid. It takes hours to get all the pre-booked meals delivered and meanwhile there is no service from the cabin crew you cant get a drink or anything until about 2-3 hours into the flight. For these reasons I would only choose to fly Scoot again if the fare is very cheap.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,5,yes,,

I am 6 ft 5 and found the seats in ScootBiz cabin perfectly comfortable. I have flown Singapore airlines on the same route and yes they are a first class airline no doubt but a fare which cost less than half of what a Singapore Airlines economy seat fare does the issue stops. Food included with the ticket was OK plane was on time and clean. Forget all the other whinging gripes people have if you want an airlines which offers the bare basics but an affordable trip go for Scoot if you need to have your every whim and desire satisfied go with a full service carrier.

2014-01-03,,Australia,,Scoot customer review,PER-SIN-PER. The website was difficult to access and understand let alone come to grips with what was on offer. A bad decision was to opt for payment of excess baggage (over 15kg) at the airport which cost $264. Boarding was chaotic the plane eventually departing 35 minutes late. My wife ordered a meal that would not be fit for a dog's consumption mine being a concoction which was barely edible. Onboard in the equivalent of premium economy the seats were sufficiently comfortable for a 5 hour flight but no more. There would appear to be very little the cabin crew knew of basics that is so superbly demonstrated by its parent company. While in Singapore I tried to pay for baggage through the website and only with the assistance of a family member was this achieved after 3 days of trying. The return flight was about 40% capacity and the service was still below average. Duty free shopping was not on a trolley but was available at the rear galley of the plane (no announcement to this effect). I did like the list of passenger seat numbers showing who had ordered food on line - a scrappy piece of cardboard stuck to one of the cupboards. Sure it's a budget airline but all the basics are missing.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,2,no,,
2014-01-02,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Singapore to Perth. Checked in 30 minutes early no problem. Had to remind check in that we had business lounge and asked for process and direction also had to ask for tag for hand luggage as given on previous trip. Lounge which cost extra was operated by SATS comfortable and better than Qantas lounge we used recently. Good food and drink choice massage chair and internet. No loungers or flat chairs. Boarded plane easily not sure if announcer asked Scoot Biz to board but we got on with no issues. Comfort in seats good I would rate cabin and seats as comparable with premium economy as I've travelled business and generally seats are much wider. Service was good with getting water at start of flight and meal promptly after take off. Would be good to get another drink later in flight to make it more biz style. My big issue was with taking my own laptop on and not getting it to work I downloaded at home before going but could not get it working. My advice hire a tablet for $20 or take your own entertainment. It's a shame as this was the only negative of the experience. Flights all good on timings. Overall it's a premium economy seat with a basic economy/ budget service if the comfort of the seat is important to you then worthwhile.,,,,,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes,,
2014-01-02,5,Australia,,Scoot customer review,PER-SIN-PER just after Christmas as the fares were incredibly cheap (less than $850 for three people to SIN and back). Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot. I was actually surprised that something so bad could actually come from Singapore. Only recommended on the basis of price.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2014-01-02,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Travelled Perth to Singapore on new route. Checking in was straight forward and plane on time. When boarding they asked people at the back of the plane to board first not sure what seat numbers this included. Got on board and had a stretch seat plenty of leg room which was great news being over 6 foot. Generally the seats are more comfortable than any budget airline I have travelled did notice the 3-4-3 is much tighter than the 3-3-3 with Singapore Airlines on the same plane but was ok. Food and tablet arrived quickly once we took off and I was seated very close to back of plane. Big issue was that they collected tablet an hour before we landed I managed to watch one movie and half of another. Even with watching tablet as soon as I received and whilst eating. Food was tasty and very spicy with a can of coke and a small pack if Pringles this was a pre paid meal. Overall a very good service comparable to other economy services better than any budget airline I have travel led with.

2013-12-21,3,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Thought we would give them a try as fares were reasonable but it's nowhere near business class good legroom on seats but more like a bad premium economy. Crew weren't really interested in customers. 30-40 minutes for them to answer a call for a drink on TZ1 Sydney to Singapore on the way back they were quicker. In scoot biz you can bring your own device for entertainment and not be charged everyone who I saw couldn't get it to work. Crew were more interested in chatting in the galley than helping.

2013-12-21,4,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Singapore to Sydney Nov 2013. Left on time both directions. Got yellow seats for extra space and it was worth it for additional leg room. Service was OK but cool and not very welcoming. Meals which we ordered in advance are poor and don't recommend them other than the Sandwiches and pot noodles which you can buy 'on the go'. The plane was full both ways. The worst experience was the freezing cabin on both flights so much so we became convinced that this was done to 'encourage' us to invest in renting pillows and blankets.

I guess Scoot didn't do much rework of the interiors as they are expecting new planes to be delivered. The legroom in ScootBiz was ok. Seats was ok and was neither comfortable or uncomfortable. It could have been better if food was better there were more drinks that could be offered to ScootBiz class.

2013-11-29,8,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Flown on TZ2 SIN-SYD and TZ1 SYD-SIN recently on FlyBag ticket. Scoot's website is user friendly. Check-in at Singapore's Changi Airport and Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was fast friendly and efficient. On board planes 9V-OTE and 9V-OTA looked well maintained. The interior was clean and had a fresh look. Seats are not too uncomfortable with good legroom. However the light and call attendant buttons were too easily triggered by passengers shifting about in their seats. Pleasantly surprised that the cabin staff regularly ensure that the toilets are cleaned and freshened. They seem to put a lot of effort into it which I greatly appreciate as an almost full load both ways result in heavy toilet usage. Captain and first officer spoke very clearly when making announcements something I seldom experienced when travelling with other airlines even full-service ones. Food however is not fantastic and leaves much to be desired. Overall a good experience with Scoot and may consider flying with them again.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,4,yes,,
2013-11-22,9,Thailand,,Scoot customer review,"We were flying BKK to SYD but found better value flights booking BKK-SIN separate to the long haul flight strangely. Booking system is great and very flexible. You can pick and choose say Business one leg and economy return. Our SYD-SIN flight was cancelled and Scoot automatically re-booked us 1 day earlier. This didn't suit us so agreed to change at no extra cost and also changed the next leg returning to BKK bought on a separate booking. Also impressive from an LCC. Flew Business class from BKK to SIN return because the marginal extra costs wasn't that much more. Good seat pitch space. Not too full. Leather seats a little hard but OK. Food ordered was changed but no big deal on short flight. Staff were never rude but they were not overly friendly which was a surprise given their supposed ""Scootitude"" (attitude). Bought Business for the late night overnight SIN to SYD because we wanted space to sleep and was glad. Very empty with only 8 passengers so we all shuffled around and had a bench each. Except that 2 of the 3 middle row arm rests would not lift up so it wasn't really a bed. Worse luck! On this leg the staff were very attentive and around. On the daylight return SYD to SIN we flew the extra space yellow seats in the child free front economy cabin. This was very good and highly recommended. Great amount of space and worth the slight extra premium charge. Had an excellent meal on this leg with free rum and coke. Again not much attention from the staff to be honest but remember this is LCC. Only one minor point was that when we checked in for one leg we wanted to upgrade to buy the business lounge service in SIN and were told that it was too late. Rules are rules but there was at least 2 hours to go before the flight and that seemed petty to me frankly. I had been hoping to use a tablet for the entertainment but the system doesn't support a tablet. Pity but no big deal. Lastly all 4 flights were extremely punctual. I was surprised. All in we will definitely fly Scoot again. Great value and a pleasant surprise. But as with any LCC don't have high expectations and you won't be disappointed.",,,,,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2013-11-19,8,Australia,,Scoot customer review,I was pleasantly surprised by Scoot. I was in the middle section where kids are not allowed which was lovely as there were about 10 down in coach who all cried at the same time poor parents. I had the upgrade with food blanket and tablet to watch movies. Didn't use the blanket and eye mask as day time and food was too salty to eat. Staff were good and toilets were cleaned a number of times during the flight which was good. I would fly with them again and recommend.,,,,,,,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4,yes,,
2013-11-18,3,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"Nov 8 2013 BKK-SIN-SYD on ""scoot-thru"" Biz fare carry-on only. Originally advised of 1 hour delay which blew out to 2 hours with air-bridge problem at BKK and change of gate - not Scoot's fault. Departed at 10pm instead of 8.05pm. Biz section half full bulk head seats offer less leg room so moved to aisle seat further back. Seat not very comfortable less so then Premium economy on full-service airlines. Couldn't sleep much. Service friendly but minimal. Had to queue in SIN for SYD boarding pass. Why can't they supply both passes at origin? Just a money earner I think though no charge on the Biz fare. Offered water on boarding in SIN and asked if I'd like a drink. Opted for a beer which never appeared until breakfast time! Drinks on Scoot are apparently served with meals only. Flew Emirates Bus class 2 weeks prior - from the sublime to the ridiculous! AirAsia Premium a much better product though considerably more expensive.",,Business Class,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,2,no,,

But comparing to other LCCs Scoot is operating on a bigger airplane and the comfort is substantially better. Sector 2 - TPE-SIN on Scoot BIZ. Decided to upgrade at the counter. Again the reading light was not working. Seat is wider and the recline is better. Food comes with a small main course pringles and a drink.

I have never experienced such nonsense all at once from one airline. first they changed my flight and then refused to let me change it to a suitable date. Then they changed my meal from a hot meal to sandwiches which I already paid for as an option. Then they lost my baggage even though I paid extra so that they would specifically look after my baggage. Also the seats are a nightmare with no headrest and are very cramped.

2013-10-20,9,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,We travelled to Tokyo on 2nd October from Singapore with a transit at Taipei. This is our second time travelling with Scoot and both times we were quite happy with the airline. It is a budget airline and it delivers exactly what it promises. The seats are by far the most comfortable of all budget airlines that we have used and the food quite decent and not exorbitant. I had not pre-booked a meal reading reviews that food is bad but when we ordered on board we found it quite good. One tip would be to order sandwiches or food that does not need to be heated. The transit at Taipei was smooth and we reached Narita on the dot. Only reason I have not given it full marks is that we had pre-booked iPad for my daughter and the stewardess first said they had none that were working. When I insisted on the fact that we had already booked and they should refund our money she promptly brought the iPad to us. But it was a small point in an overall good journey. Scoot remains our first choice in budget airlines.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes,,

First the positives: the planes were well maintained the FAs were friendly the food was basic but fine and I did not mind paying extra for the frills. Now the negatives: the seats were uncomfortable the legroom was poor (I'm 6 ft 6 so an exit row seat in economy would have been better) the movie selection was dreadful the FAs were inexperienced and the 2.10 am departure time from Singapore to Sydney is a killer. It was an overall charmless experience which was not offset by the admittedly competitive price.,,,,,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,3,no,,

Yellow seating was great for 6 foot tall family members. We did not use the inflight entertainment as we had good books and ipad for music and we did not eat their food. They hit you 4 dollars for a small bottle of water so bringing your own empty one is a good idea. You are not meant to bring your own food aboard but it seems many do and have no issues from staff. Booking online was fine once I took the time to figure out all the options. We used the Scoot lounge in Singapore and will do this again too. Shower good food wine spirits fruit coffee internet massage chairs all good. We were on time out bound and 30 min late on our return but this was fully explained by the pilot as because of air traffic control. It could have happened to any airline.

2013-09-19,2,Australia,,Scoot customer review,I rebooked my flight because of family bereavement. My original booking was upgraded to business class from yellow coloured seat I booked earlier. I paid the penalty for my flight Gold Coast to Singapore. Less than 12 hours before my flight I realized that my seat allocation had gone. Not only the business class upgrade but also the yellow coloured seat. If I want to return to my original seat I have to pay again 14 Singapore dollars which I am not happy to do but no choice. What surprises me is that Scoot can give yellow coloured seat number 52 for free but not my original seat number 23. It just does not make sense to me. First I lost my seat allocation and upgrade to business class now Scoot asked me for SGD 14 at the last minute. I won't be flying Scoot again.

2013-09-15,8,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Traveled from SIN on 30th Aug and I must say I was impressed with Scoot! I took the blue seat (aisle) and found it very comfortable (don't forget your shoulder cushion). Then again I'm only 174cm in height so I wouldn't know about the rest. The only (small) problem was the crew kept bumping into me in the middle of the night when walking down the aisle during service but I wasn't too disturbed. Immigration in OOL is really strict! A staff member insisted on weighing all our bags and charging us for all the excess baggage so beware. Food (biryani) was good albeit small in portion and they have 2 water dispensers in the middle of the plane. Don't worry too much and just enjoy your flight!

Flight was good and both seats and food ordered was fine. Cannot expect 5 star restaurant food on a discount airline and generally most airline seats are not really that comfortable in any economy classes.

2013-08-01,5,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"One-way economy Coolangatta-Taipei (via 8 hour layover Singapore). Departure and arrival on schedule. Paid extra for a ""yellow"" seat with more leg room; 5+ kg luggage; and ScootThru. Later decided to upgrade to ScootBiz but the website does not allow for upgrading. Check-in very crowded slow and understaffed. Avoided the crowd by going to the ScootBiz counter and upgrading but could only upgrade to Singapore. I had to upgrade Singapore- Taipei at Changi. ScootBiz is not luxurious. Seat is a little wider and with a power outlet. Metal foot rest is uncomfortable. Meal was a sandwich and a small can of Pringles plus a drink. Flight crew were young energetic all very nice and well groomed. The pilot and crews English pronunciation were mostly incomprehensible. Entertainment package - you login using a special PIN. There are no instructions on how to set up your computer. No one from Scoot will help you. Upon arrival in Singapore I went to the Transfer counter in Lounge E Terminal 2 to get my new boarding pass. Transfer desk had 2 people working I waited 45 minutes. At Changi Airport I had gone to the Widevine Media Optimizer website and downloaded the entertainment browser add-on after which it installed without a problem.

2013-07-15,,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"Their customer service is appalling staff are the rudest airline staff I've come across. I flew ""business class"" from Sydney to Singapore and I hated the experience. Check-in was chaotic with the supposedly dedicated business class line checking in a large group of economy class passengers. When I approached I was told to wait at the end of that line even though I was a business class passenger. No lounge access at Sydney airport. The main problem was onboard. Their business class seats were inferior to several major carrier's economy seats. Hardly enough legroom and the person behind was constantly bumping the back of my seat. Recline on the seats was minimal as to be unnoticeable. No inflight entertainment and all that was on offer was a miserable tablet pre-loaded with 3 movies which was not free not even for business class passengers. The food was horrible and simply consisted of a bottle of water and a container with brown heated goo in it.

2013-07-14,10,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Return flights Gold Coast - SIN - return. We booked this flight to add on to our onward European flights. We saved over A$1000 by SCOOTing from the GC to SIN then picking up Malaysian airlines from there to London instead of flying from BNE direct. A 7-8 hr flight is not hard work so we chose the Fly-Bag option and ate before we flew on both sectors. We paid to select extra legroom seats and travelled the equivalent of premium economy seat pitch and were very comfortable. Flights ran on time - and arrived ahead of schedule in both directions. Staff courteous and attentive. They cleaned the toilets at least 3 times an hour - more frequently than on any other plane Ive been on. I would not hesitate to recommend or fly them again. If you're aware its a low cost airline and go prepared with a meal in your belly your own iPad and a book and perhaps purchase a coffee on board and opt for the extra legroom - you can bag yourself a bargain.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,5,yes,,

2013-06-10,4,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"We just got back from 4 weeks away in Asia. We took Scoot to Singapore for around $AUD200 (each) including 15kg each and a meal. There is nothing flash about this airline but the room between rows was acceptable! The staff were efficient and the food was OK. We bought ""FlyBagEat"" however you have to add on the cost of a seat to this fare how are you going to fly without a seat? The ""convenience fee"" of a $10 was added (apparently for credit card)! All in all we had no complaints about the trip over. We also booked a trip back but as this leaves at 2.10am we decided to buy a super seat for about an extra $40 each. This turned out to be worth every cent - we booked a seat in aisle 21 just behind business class and had the bulkhead in front. My husband could stretch his legs and we didn't have anyone in front so didn't have to worry about anyone wanting to recline their seat. On the way back we arrived at 5pm at Changi with luggage for a flight leaving at 2am. It cost us $5 each for the early check-in and you have to pay in cash. One good value deal was access to the SATS lounge for $S39 each. This allows you to use the lounge for 4 hours (consecutive use). This was a wonderful oasis for us. Also you get priority boarding which is a real asset at 2am in the morning! I thought the breakfast was revolting (fried mushrooms a sausage of sorts a triangle of some egg dish (omelette perhaps) and a soggy hash brown. You have to remember these dishes have been kept warm for the last 6 hours or so. One redeeming feature was some fresh fruit and a drink of orange juice.

Flight itself was delayed slightly at Sydney (20 mins) but on-board the crew were very genuine and friendly and the seat was very comfortable although there were a few issues of lights going on and off. The way some people choose to sit seems to activate the lights which isn't really the passengers fault. The food was not particularly satisfying and because I don't have a tablet device I couldn't take advantage of the free ""ScootTV"".

As advertised there was a special entry aisle for Scoot Biz Class but it was hard to see because of the crowd. We were actually first on board and our seats were as planned. As soon as we sat down we were served with cold water with a friendly greeting. A lot has been said about the Biz Class seats and some of it sadly is true but travellers must remember the fare is about a quarter of what other Australian airlines charge and half of that charged by rival Air Asia.

ScootBiz was awesome and well worth the extra. I have flown Premium Economy with JAL before and it was terrible compared to ScootBiz. ScootBiz had good leg-room and nice wide seats you get to board first and get off first you get served when you want it. We took our own drinks and food on the plane and we were happy.

I didn't hire the inflight tablets I read a book. Drinking water was available on the flight near the toilets in the middle of the economy section. Overall for a one-way ticket that cost $240 all up I was pleased with the value for money. I would fly Scoot again if I needed to.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2013-04-21,10,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Sydney to Singapore. The check-in was quick and left on time. Cabin crew cheerful and energetic. I did not select anything to eat when I booked the tickets but ordered from foods available on menu inflight. The hot Italian veggie food was tasty and filling - about 8 AUD which is quite cheap. I found their menu to be reasonably priced. The leg space was sufficient. I observed that leg space of some seats (yellow) for which you need to pay extra was large especially the first row. When you book online you have options of paying by credit card or through POLI using your bank account. I chose the second option of going through bank and had to wait for more than 24 hrs for the bank transfer to complete and ticket delivered. I also had to do few follow-ups with their customer centre. If people are travelling within the next 2 or 3 days of booking I suggest to use credit-card which should result in a ticket immediately. Overall very satisfied with my first experience with Scoot and happy that I saved about $A350 for my one- way trip to Singapore by booking Scoot.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2013-04-21,10,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Brisbane to Bangkok return. We paid $1430 for four of us to fly to Bangkok return. I had a couple of queries prior to flying and emails were promptly replied to and information provided. All four flights on time. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient. We did pre-order a meal Coolangatta to Singapore which admittedly I will not be doing again - the worst airline meal I have ever had. We learnt our lesson and didn't worry with the on board food service again. I noticed a number of reviewers complained about lengthy check-in queues - perhaps we were lucky but we had no such difficulties. I should mention that between the four of us we did only have 3 small backpacks which were less then 7kg in weight and we checked them in as cabin luggage. On the way home we did arrive at both Bangkok and Singapore airports quite early (around 3.5 hours) due to an early flight from Koh Samui and an overnight in Singapore. So we were the first ones to check in. this worked in our favour as we were for some reason automatically upgraded to the yellow seats on both sectors. they are definitely more comfy and have more leg room then the blue seats. However to be honest we are not big people (average height average build) so the blue seats were fine for us anyway if you were taller or bigger in size it may be more uncomfortable I guess. Overall we had a great experience with Scoot. The price was incredibly cheap at just over $1400 for four of us.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2013-04-18,8,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Sydney to Singapore last August. Sydney ground staff were really good except for one. The seats were like concrete after a few hours. Taking the Kindle was a great idea. No inflight entertainment except at added expense. The food that passengers ordered at extra cost looked quite palatable. Cabin staff were really nice. Seats are a bit narrow. Leg room is constricted. Take a snack from the post customs food shops to get you to Singapore. If traveling on from Singapore allow time for possible delays.

Flight home was late at night - a little cramped with 2 adults and 3 kids on 4 seats while everyone else had 3 seats to themselves to spread out and sleep.

2013-03-25,5,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Travel from SIN-Qingdao on a Boeing 777. Booked ScootBiz seat and it was more like Economy Plus. Ground crew was slow in checking-in it was a near full flight of over 300 passengers and took almost an hour to clear everyone. Allowing 15kgs cabin baggage is a grave mistake as most passengers on this flight brought in at least 2 pieces of baggage each making the clearance extra slow at the screening area. Those who board plane later had no space left for their baggage. Aircrew was not well trained the worst I've encountered in a budget airline. I could hardly understand the announcement in English with a heavy Japanese accent. Announcement in Mandarin was also below standard.,,,,,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes,,

My expectation was pretty limited. We took a neck pillow and warm clothes to overcome the seat discomfort and temperature issue. We didn't hear any annoying call bells (accidentally pressed) either. Cabin crew were good as well. One disappointment might be the food which was not the dish we selected while buying tickets and also it would be too spicy for some people. Overall journey took 40 minutes more than the scheduled time. When coming back to Singapore the flight was delayed 35 minutes. We were fortunate enough to have no luggage issues.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,

Had Scoot through for our onward flight to Bangkok but the transfer lounge was so far away and the queue took too long that it would have been just as quick to go through Immigration and rebook in. Flight to Bangkok was good and on time. We flew back to the Gold Coast with Scoot and the night time flight was good with a bit of extra space not all seats full and I felt comfortable in my seat.

2013-03-08,2,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Our initial flight from Bangkok to Singapore was delayed 4 hours. This of course is fine and expected with budget airlines. However we had a connecting flight from Singapore. The staff at Bangkok airport told us that it was ok because the connecting flight would wait for us hence we didn't make any arrangements (eg book a hotel or another flight). However when arriving at Singapore at 2am we were told the flight had left and that we would have to wait until 2am the next morning. We were also told that we had to check in 10 hours before our next flight to guarantee a seat. Ground staff explained if we wanted to we could book another flight and receive a full refund for our Singapore to Sydney leg.

2013-02-26,,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Flew Scoot Sydney to Singapore 2pm flight. Checked in at 12 and told flight was delayed 2 hours. Boards showed flight boarding so went to boarding gate only to be told flight was delayed again - no one knew why. 2 hours later we got to board. Sat on the plane for almost an hour before we took off. My first son flew two weeks later - his flight was delayed by an hour - boarding was chaotic whilst every friend and his brother tried to rush onto the plane irrespective of a zone call. My daughter in law flew in last week Friday. Arrival time was 7pm. Looking online we saw the flight was delayed by 2 hours. We arrived at the airport at 9pm - flight board showed arrival as 9.15pm. At 9.30pm arrival time was changed to 10.22pm! Delayed 3.5 hours! Hugely unimpressed with Scoot.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,,
2013-02-25,,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,I have flown Scoot with the whole family twice in the past 3 months from Sydney to Singapore and then the reverse. The ground service is poor. Long queues excessively long times to check-in (stood at check-in for 45 mins). On one occasion we arranged for Scoot to have someone assist my non-English speaking cousin to take her through customs and on to the plane. When we got to the airport our assistance had not been assigned. We waited until the queues had vanished from check-in and the counter staff simply ignored us and went on with their other duties. t is impossible to get through to their call centre - they seem to be perpetually experiencing a high volume of calls never mind the time. I've tried calling at around 9pm Sydney time 6am Sydney time and about 2pm Singapore time. Only got through once at the 6am timeslot and only after been put on hold for 45 mins (time by Skype).,,,,,,,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,4,no,,

Booked the rear seats in business class and found them very comfortable and better than Jetstar business but not as good as Air Asia X business class. Food was not appealing and very basic but for under $500 dollars one way was not complaining. The staff looked very young and were helpful but not of a standard of usual business class but once again its a low cost airline. I enjoyed a nice sleep travelling in both direction and was very refreshed on landing. Food and drink on plane was expensive especially water. Major complaint was after getting on and off plane before everybody else when collecting bags both times my bags were last to appear on carousel.

However I had paid for the premium meal. I requested for the code for inflight entertainment I tried to press the call button but no crew responded the lights were on for an hour.

Yet when our turn came to check in there was no apparent time saving. The check in staff were inappropriately dressed they were indistinguishable from general airport workers. Onboard we had ordered the blanket sets and had to ask 3 times for them although they did apologise when we finally received them. The overhead reading light switches on the arm were very sensitive so that every time you press against the arm the light would come on.

Never mind the 2 onward flights I'm going to have to miss and non refundable accommodation on top - what I want to know is why were customers not emailed on the additional delay? The opportunity to arrange not sitting in this airport would have been welcomed. You forget that many of your flyers are from Brisbane - we can't exactly hop in a cab and go back home.

I had a connecting flight from Singapore to Frankfurt at 12pm that night and told Scoot staff that I would miss my connecting flight they weren't bothered when I pushed about returning at 4pm the staff member finally admitted that they didn't even know if they flight would go at the proposed time that evening as the plane had to come from China and hadn't left there due to a snowstorm!

2013-02-04,3,Thailand,,Scoot customer review,Booked a return flight from BKK to SG. Pre-selected window seat in the red seating of the aircraft. The seats were very thin - ok for a short haul 2 hour flight. The person in front reclined their seat which literally meant I had a headrest in my face. Flight departed on time which was a relief after seeing other reviews. Cabin attendants were far from 'fun vibrant' crew members mentioned in all the airline PR. More like exhausted/frustrated with their job. One snapped at a women when she asked to clarify the pre-ordered sandwich she had just been given. All in all an ok flight. Decided to upgrade to Biz scootz for the return leg just. Very easy to upgrade in SG - 99 SD plus 20SD administration fee.

2013-02-04,10,Australia,,Scoot customer review,We flew Scoot Biz from SYD-SIN on 5th of Jan and found it a very comfortable flight. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. I read up beforehand on their website that IFE wasn't available on their IPads so I brought my own so that you can just live stream movies from their system. Seats were wide enough and recline was ok for a sleep with very good head rests the only complaint is there is no space between armrests so it's just like in economy where there isn't enough room for your arm and the person next to yours. Only 1 drink and meal included but the beers were reasonably priced at $4 AU but water was expensive at $3AU. Flight was on time and check in a breeze through the dedicated Biz counter. Boarding was good with a separate biz boarding so we were first. Pilot was down to earth and entertaining.

Even though we'd booked this as one return flight Scoot considered these to be separate flights therefore the missed connection was our problem not theirs so we had to book a new trip with Tiger to Bangkok as well as losing our prepaid accommodation and having to pay for a night in Singapore. Very little communication or explanation from Scoot no offer of any compensation or even a complimentary bottle of water. Promise of a $30 scoot voucher that never arrived. On our flight home via Singapore from Bangkok our flight was three hours delayed. From Singapore home it was delayed a two hours that turned into about four.

On Scoot you have an entitlement and any additional was going to be chargeable - the meal was small in portion. Check-in counter staff was rude at SYD - my check in baggage was overweight by a couple of kgs but my carry on was very light - they wanted to charge a hefty amount for overweight baggage - or else take it out of your check in and carry with you the end result is still the same weight whether I carried it in my hand baggage or check in.

Only about a dozen people in front of us but it took an hour to check them in. Of course no lounge but I expected that. Priority boarding was people at the back of the plane board first oh and Business which meant a rush to the queue. The seats relined a little more than most standard seats. I asked to watch a tablet for entertainment and was told they were having technically difficulties and were not available. I since found out they haven't been available for months. Despite leaving at night and arriving in the morning you only get 1 meal and 1 drink. A comfort pack was extra we paid $8 for 1 blanket. We paid an extra $250 for: 1 Meal and 1 drink. Over 70% of the passengers boarded before us which meant the Gold Coast customs line was out onto the tarmac by the time we got off. They had 3 international flights arrive at once as they do most mornings. This airport can barely handle 1 international flight.

The seats (Yellow seats $25AUD more) were very good. I am 6ft3 yet I fit very easily and had plenty of room to stretch my legs under the seat in front. Fully aware that there was no IFE so we took our own. Meals were very average but that is not too surprising.

2013-01-08,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Flew OOL-SIN for the first time on 25 Dec 12. Very pleasantly surprised. Although the flight was full the B777 did give the impression of spaciousness. Pleased that I had paid a little extra for an upgraded seat though. Plenty of legroom - but the armrests are very narrow. No headrests on the seats and the installation of these would be a big plus. The in-flight meals (even the upgraded ones) are no more than snacks - but that was not a big deal. There is of course no IFE. However if you are happy enough to read or use a computer the time passes quite quickly. My only criticism is that the food service was a little chaotic. Other than that Scoot represents excellent value. I'm planning to use Scoot's OOL services in future as a 'launchpad' to the multitude of destinations available from SIN.

Throughout the 4 hour flight the call buttons were ringing non-stop making any sleep impossible. The call button is placed right beside the armrest so almost everyone accidentally pressed it.

Naturally the food service was basic but not too expensive compared to some other budget carriers I have flown with. Surprisingly I was placed in a yellow stretched seat but while the seating did have more leg room the lack of adjustable headrest did not make it too much better.

2012-11-30,6,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"BKK-SIN connecting to SIN-SYD on 28/29 November. As other posters have noted it's definitely worth paying for the extra leg room in the yellow ""Stretch"" seats. However the seats themselves are very narrow (10 abreast in a 777) and are uncomfortable with no head rest. The forward economy cabin was also very cold. I pre-paid for meals but wouldn't do so again. In future I would bring my own food. I also pre-paid for ""Scoot-thru."" - the Scoot transfer facility in Singapore for Scoot-Scoot or Tiger passengers. The advantage of doing this is that it provides a similar connection facility to that of just about any legacy carrier. Not pre- paying this fee means that if I had missed the connecting flight I would have had to pay (according to Scoot terms and conditions) a re-booking fare and the fare differential for the next available flight even if the problem was with Scoot. Paying the ""Scoot-thru"" fee also meant that in Singapore I did not have to claim my bag clear customs and check in again for the connecting flight. Instead I was able to organise my next flight at Scoot's transfer facility within the airside departure level. Service is friendly but the staff don't seem particularly assertive. Overall I found Scoot to be cheap and cheerful and if you're a budget traveller I would recommend.",,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,4,yes,,
2012-11-28,9,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Flew SIN-SYD-SIN. Seats were really comfortable for a budget carrier. If you can book the economy plus (yellow seats). For a bit more you get a lot more leg space. The food and beverage bundle was worth the money. Food was nice and cabin crew was efficient. Hopefully they can size up their fleet so that there will not be any delays.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,4,yes,,
2012-11-23,10,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,I flew Singapore to Gold Coast return. Flight took off on time the seats were comfortable compared to other budget airlines.

2012-11-21,8,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,SIN-OOL-SIN flight TZ006 and TZ005. SIN-OOL check in could have been a lot faster as we were the first few in line. Boarding was slow but smooth. The taxi and takeoff roll were done professionally. Food was served 1.5hrs after takeoff had lasagne which was not too bad its better to pre-order online to prevent long waiting times. For the rest of the flight I slept. Outbound flight ended well with a smooth landing but the immigration at Gold Coast wasn't very fast at all. OOL-SIN a long line at check in followed by another long line at immigration and boarding once on board managed to rest until takeoff. Food served 1.5hrs into the flight and had the lasagne meal which includes pepsi and fruit chips. Landing was fairly smooth. Overall I think Scoot is a fairly reasonable airline if you just want to eat and sleep my advice would be to download movies on a tablet and bring it onboard to past the time.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,4,yes,,
2012-11-21,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Value for money! Paid for the extra leg room and it was worth the extra. The food was simple. Suggest passengers eat a good meal before boarding and take snacks. Suggest passengers take a warm jumper or rug because it can be a bit cool. Cabin staff were smartly dressed and friendly. Take a book Kindle or other entertainment.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-11-20,10,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,SIN-SYD-SIN in Nov 2012. Sat in rows 24 D-G and 25 D-G to and fro. Paid $30 more per seat per person per way. Decent leg room. Satisfied with their service. Served food 4 hours after take off at 2am which was just right. The food was piping hot. The crew were polite efficient and professional. The aircraft was clean and new. The crew will periodically inspect the toilets to ensure cleanliness. Will definitely travel with scoot again.

2012-11-19,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,We had better service with Scoot than on full cost airlines the planes were clean and the cabin staff attentive.

2012-11-10,7,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Recently travelled SIN-TPE-SIN. Managed to get the promotional fares on their recently launched new route. Poor legroom and seat space but bearable for a 4hr flight. The Air-conditioning was too cold both ways. Cabin crew was amateurish but efficient. Flight to TPE was full but only 60% on the way back.

Economy seat is sufficient and comparable to other low cost carriers. Food was not purchased as I prefer to eat before and after a flight on LCC. Drink prices are reasonable.

2012-11-01,5,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Travelled from SIN-OOL 2 days ago on a 777 and were not impressed. The seats were very hard and had no head rest! The cabin service was almost non existent and the food was inedible. The water is $4 for a 330ml bottle which is outrageous. The call buttons kept going off all night.

2012-10-25,7,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Managed to obtain really good priced tickets from SYD to SIN and back. 10 seats across on 772 which is pretty tight. Flight out on time departure and early arrival. Flight back early departure and arrival.

2012-10-14,3,Australia,,Scoot customer review,SYD-SIN-SYD and would not use Scoot again. Our 7 year old daughter found the seats a great size but my size 8 wife and my average size were very uncomfortable. There were no comforts. No entertainment system without paying no drinks without paying (water was $4) no fold-out head rests no blankets ($12) no pillows ($10) no foot rests the seats were smallest imaginable (they ask you to pay more once on board if you want to move up to the yellow seat). The staff were polite and sweet. The meal we purchased was unappetising. Plane was new and the landings were very smooth so as far as safe flying I cannot complain but the level of comfort was surprisingly low.,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no,,
2012-10-12,8,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Singapore-Gold Coast Oct 11th. Departed and arrived 10 min late due to Tech fault. Check in reasonable although strange - check in staff collect passports whilst waiting in check in line and take to document counter for processing then return to pass and direct you to check in counter. This in my opinion slows down check in. Meal service started 1.5hrs after take off pre booked meals served first however they start from row 21 and take a further 1.5hrs to reach seat 61 where I sat - the meal was cold and inedible. Economy blue seats leg room okay however I paid extra for Super seat (well worth the payment). Rows 61-64 are definitely the best - a larger seat and more leg room than other Super seat. Apart from food a good budget airline. Staff extremely professional.,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-10-11,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney 4-5 October 2012. For a tall person leg space for seating good and comfortable. General in flight service good.

2012-10-04,8,Malaysia,,Scoot customer review,Flew SIN-SYD-SIN in August 2012 with my family (2 adults and 2 children). No complaints and definitely value for money. We did a comparison with their RED competitor for flights on the same sectors on the same days and the difference is mind boggling! Can't say the same thing for the lasagne though which is probably the worst among the good experience we had! Another annoying thing is that the call button will forever be triggered by someone accidentally being located at the armrest.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-09-19,3,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Flew from Singapore to Gold Coast in Scoot Biz. Had flown to Singapore from Brisbane in Premium Economy on Qantas so can make direct comparison. Scoot Biz (SB) was cheaper but seat size leg room meal service and entertainment options were worse if existent. The QF flight had tablet space for 2 drinks between seats SB had normal seat arm as in economy. Leg rest in SB seemed not worth it very little space due to pitch whilst I found meal indelible and nothing before landing or drink on takeoff. Also they made some announcement re streaming then didn't offer IPad. I was ready for sleep anyway. However the info on entertainment choice meant probably wouldn't watch it. In future I would go for Flystretch seats if I used them again after all they actually got to leave aircraft before Seat Biz. Warning in seat power is shared between 2 but use Singapore/UK plugs. Fellow travellers were also low cost travellers.,,,,,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,3,yes,,

2012-08-28,3,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Boeing 777 but felt more cramped than an Airbus 320 as the 777 carries more passengers. Service call button and light switch is too close to each other and in a position where a 2.5hr flight from SIN-BKK was nothing but a symphony of calls for service. Flew FlyBagEat. Was informed that my online pre-ordered Eat was not available. I declined offer of another meal and asked for a refund. They got me my pre-ordered meal from Biz Class. My Eat was only served to me 10 minutes before the plane started descent into BKK. I had to struggle with the factory sealed microwave meal it was sealed so tightly I really had to struggle to open it without creating a mess. Good thing I bought a one-way ticket on my inaugural flight with Scoot. My flight back to SIN was on Tiger Airways.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,3,no,,
2012-08-28,10,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Flew Scoot for the first time and had a very enjoyable experience. The seats are actually very comfortable and already well reclined in its up-right state. I didn't feel the need to recline my seat throughout my SIN- SYD trip. There was sufficient legroom and space under the seats to stretch your legs and ample overhead storage space. I didn't miss the entertainment as I brought my own tablet as had most people. That said onboard rental of a fully loaded iPad at $22 seems reasonable to me. While I didn't try all food on offer I did load up on snacks and I like the flexibility of being able to purchase what I wanted when I wanted. The one issue I have is the positioning of the call button on the armrest that often gets accidentally depressed whenever you shift positions in your seat. I'm not a large person but I seemed to set off the pinging each time I shifted. The downside of course is that the stewards/stewardesses may not be as responsive when you actually want to call them. Overall I rate Scoot and my first experience with them highly and think that if they can maintain standards which shouldn't be difficult given their SQ pedigree they will be a success.,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-08-28,9,Malaysia,,Scoot customer review,We flew from Singapore to Sydney in August and had a pleasant flight. Save for the delay in landing due to the Sydney control tower the flight was nice. On the way back from Sydney to Singapore we had a nice trip too. As it is a 400+ passenger 777-200 plane the food served was a bit slow but we had a nice breakfast in Sydney so it was a non issue. There were minor blips like running out of bottled water for sale overall the food selection was nice. More legroom and better choice of food (compared to AirAsiaX). As a point to note we flew KUL-SG-Sydney (using FlyScoot) instead of KUL-Sydney by AirAsiaX. We had time to spare and we have no regrets spending time in Changi before going on FlyScoot to Sydney and back. We will do this again in November 2012.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-08-28,7,Australia,,Scoot customer review,"I was surprisingly pleased with my OOL-SIN flight. I had spent the extra A$24 on a Super Seat and was very pleased with the legroom and recline angle as well as the comfort of the seat padding etc. The lack of headrests still baffles me though and I would hope they do something about this in the future. The crew seem quite inexperienced and do not show the calm and assertive behaviour that I am used to from most airlines yet they are friendly and polite. The scripted announcements with things such as ""Scooting off"" (instead of taking off) add to this feeling: friendly attempting to be fun yet not assertive or what I would consider professional air crew behaviour. The flight was delayed by some 30 minutes. All in all I would not hesitate to fly with Scoot again.",,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-08-23,6,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Took a long week end to fly from Singapore to Gold Coast. Because my companion is a big guy we took one Super Seat and one standard Seat. Both are aisle seats. Turns out there is not much difference. As we departed at 10.30pm we expected to have a nap within the 7-hour flight. Since the plane adopts a 3-4-3 seating plan the aisles are extremely narrow. Every time the trolley came by the flight attendant shoved my arm and woke me up. The passenger next to me was a tall guy whose elbow kept poking my other arm. Despite this we may still fly them again and low price is the main reason.,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,4,yes,,

The most uncomfortable airline seat I've ever experienced - shallow narrow no headrest no lumbar support small pitch. The food was a very small portion so do not purchase a ticket that includes food. FLY/BAG are the only tickets to consider and bring your own food. Call buttons rang constantly throughout the overnight flight due to their location low on armrests and passengers accidentally activating them when moving in the narrow seats.

2012-08-16,4,Australia,,Scoot customer review,We just flew Gold Coast -Singapore - Gold Coast on Scoot Biz and they would have to be the worst seats in the sky. No foot rest extremely thin and uncomfortable. Scoot have missed a golden opportunity to snatch market share from Air Asia who have flat bed seats in Biz.

2012-08-14,8,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,SIN-BKK-SIN. Easy to see why Scoot is the preferred LCC for this route. Large B777-200 with 31' pitch vs other LCC's A320 with 29' pitch. However on medium haul flight much prefer Jetstar's A330 which offer same pitch but with head rest and personnel screen on each seats. But will definitely use them again if price is right. Just remember to bring my own pillow as I find the seat hard and uncomfortable without the head rest.,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-08-06,8,Thailand,,Scoot customer review,Flew ScootBiz BKK to SYD with change of plane in SIN as an experiment to see what this airline is like even though I had other options. For budget airlines the seats were actually quite good food not so bad but the flight attendants were extremely good.

2012-08-05,9,Australia,,Scoot customer review,We flew last week and upgraded to the premium seats with additional legroom. The seats were immediately behind business class with lots of legroom - in front of the wing and therefore quieter. The seats were quite comfortable. The plane had arrived 20 mins late and left 30 mins late - about 15 mins was made up on the flight. The return flight left on time and arrived early. Food was not very exciting airline fare. A welcome change from the usual much more expensive flights.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-08-01,8,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Sydney to Singapore. We had seats 21 DEFG which are the bulk head row seats which we found very good. We had plenty of legroom but bear in mind that the armrest are fixed. Seats on the day flight over were fine coming home on the night flight they were not very comfortable for sleeping quite tight and don't recline far but didn't expect much. The food was awful I wouldn't bother pre-purchasing just bring some snacks. The service was friendly but a little slow. For a LCC I found them really good and for less than half the price really great value. We departed and landed on time had no real issues with anything I would use them again but would certainly aim to get the bulk head row again or at least the super seats - normal seats looked really uncomfortable.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,5,yes,,
2012-08-01,4,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Very uncomfortable seats hard narrow and without proper neck support as you find on Jetstar. Though the pitch is okay the placement of the seat supports meant that I felt cramped at the window seat. I emerged off my flights feeling stiff and sore. I missed the moving map as there are no cabin screens. Issues with inadvertent pressing of call buttons mean that they are often ignored by staff even when required. Attendants seemed helpful but difficult to hear and understand over the cabin noise. No online check in and lack of early check at the desk is inconvenient when departing from Changi to Sydney at 2 am as you can't use all Changi's wonderful airside facilities. Much preferred Jetstar.,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,,4,no,,
2012-07-26,10,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,Given their fares are about half that of the cheapest competitors with all possible add-ons I don't think one can really complain about the fees for checked baggage iPads or meals. The food was nothing amazing but the staff were great and helpful. 10-across B777-2 is not exactly comfortable but it is bearable for an 8 hour flight to Australia and definitely worth the price. The iPads are well loaded and easy to use would definitely recommend getting one if you're not going to sleep aboard. All in all given their an LCC and their prices are so low you certainly get a lot for what you paid for.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes,,
2012-07-09,7,Australia,,Scoot customer review,Flight good however the delivery of food service was very poor. Running back and forth with individual food and drink for passengers is such a waste of time. This cannot be difficult to achieve as other budget airlines seem to have a smooth flow of service even at a basic level. Also the quality of product available should be reviewed. Happy to pay a little more. However I will travel Scoot again. With these adjustments more profit and potentially a good product in a competitive market.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,4,yes,,
2012-07-04,6,Australia,,Scoot customer review,They are slowly getting their act together. Food not the best but not overly expensive for what you get. No entertainment inflight - suggest you take some but on night flight return really not needed. I paid extra for leg room 31k not the best and by the toilets - not worth the extra. The next 2 rows back would be my pick next time. Will there be a next time yes I would fly Scoot again.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3,yes,,

2012-06-27,4,Singapore,,Scoot customer review,"Taking this budget airline was not easy especially when you are seated right at the back of Boeing 777. The cabin crew were quite friendly but the fact that many of them were new they could only answer questions and complaints with ""I'm not very sure"" ""I'll check for you"" and ""sorry"". And it took them to serve food 2 hours after takeoff in which case many passengers at the back were starving. Then it took another 1 hour to serve the drinks and expect the leftovers of what the passengers in the front seats to be served to you. And it was difficult to hear what the stewardesses were announcing to us.",,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,3,no,,
