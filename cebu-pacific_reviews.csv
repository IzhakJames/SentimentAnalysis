cebu-pacific,891273,2024-03-20,1,New Zealand,Trip Verified,"""Avoid this airline""","Cebu Pacific have a new policy of doing a 'security check' as you board the plane. Basically, Cebu Pacific staff will make you tip out your water bottle at the gate, under the guise of 'security'. (This is after the aviation security have done a proper search including x-rays, and you've refilled your bottle from the filtered water in the lounge). I asked if they will be replacing the water - they said ""you can buy it on the plane"". So they're delaying everyone, invading everyone's privacy, so they can make a few pesos selling bottled water on the plane. Absolutely disgusting behaviour.

Our flight to Hong Kong (from Manila) was scheduled for 15.35 on Feb 17. We boarded on time, and (stupidly) I believed that everything would go as planned. After driving around the runway forever, the pilot announced there was a ""technical difficulty"" and we would be returning to the boarding gate. This resulted in a fun hour long delay during which nothing was explained. After an hour of waiting, the pilot announced we would be leaving shortly. We left Manila and I (once again, stupidly) believed that all was well. After 20 minutes of flying, the pilot announced that there were technical difficulties and that we would need to turn around and go back to Manila. Upon landing in Manila at 7pm, we were assured that a new plane was available and we could board it at 8pm. Well, we boarded at 8. It is now 9.30 and we still haven't left yet. I will not be flying with Cebu Pacific again. I strongly recommend that you don't either, unless you enjoy wasting your money and being messed around for several hours.

Each time we were lied to, told a refund was coming but it never came. Cebu Pacific is intentionally changing people's booking so they can levy further charges.

cebu-pacific,882486,2023-12-11,1,United States,Trip Verified,"""wait in the check in line for over an hour""","We arrived at the Bohol-Panglao Airport 2.5 hours prior to departure. The check in counter had 5 lanes open, and about 15 groups ahead of us. We did the online check in, and used the kiosk to print our bag tags. Did this save us any time? No.  We had to wait in the check in line for over an hour waiting on other passengers to adjust their bags to avoid paying extra baggage fees - if it was one group I would understand, but it was every single one of them, and the gate agents did nothing about this. Instead they played on facebook. When it is finally our turn the gate agent says we did the bag tags wrong and re does them the same way I did. He sends the first 2 bags to be loaded and continues to the next 2 bags. On the second 2 bags he puts a transfer ticket on them without telling us that he forgot to on the first 2 bags. We noticed it but he didn't think we did. After going thru security, we talked about it and came to the conclusion that we needed to talk to someone. We couldn't afford for these bags to be delayed so we asked the security agent who we should talk to. He directs us to go back thru security and talk to the supervisor. We asked 2 people for a manager, they refused to get a manager and offered to help themselves. When we expressed our concern they offered to check our bags and they went to the sorting area and came back stating that our bags have already been sealed and cannot be checked. We then went to a security manager to express our concern and we were able to finally talk to the desk manage. He told us he could pull the bags to check, but I'd he did, they will probably not make the flight.  We arrive to Manila and departed the plane and took a bus to terminal 3. We noticed that many passengers were not getting off the plane so we asked a stewardess if this bus was for transfers and she said yes, so we proceeded. We arrived on the bus in terminal 3 at the baggage claim and needed to be at terminal 4. Confused and short on time to catch our connecting flight we found the transfer desk after having to ask for directions. The agent at the counter didn't look up from her phone until we started filming and threatening to put the video on social media. Only then did she show us where the transfer bus was. We get to another agent at the bus transfer depot and he informed us that the bus had just departed and it would be at least 30 minutes till the next one, and by then we would miss our boarding cut off. He first tells us that we need to exit the terminal and take a cab. We asked if there is another option, because we really don't have time to go back thru security. He informed us that Cebu Pacific has a private shuttle they can call and that I need to go back to the transfer desk to make the request. I get back and the agent we spoke to before agreed to call this transfer. After about 15 minutes the shuttle arrived . We were then told that the shuttle does not have permission to take us thru the airport to get us to the other terminal, and we would have to exit the airport and drive around. We arrive at terminal 4 and still have to go thru security.

The hard product is fairly standard for an Asian low cost airline. A well kept A321/320 with a tight seat pitch and no recline and a decent crew. What makes it quite an adventure is their passengers. Any flight I took with this airline started and ended in a chaos. People dragging way too much luggage into the cabin, people seemingly clueless where their seat is while blocking the aisle and frustrating the boarding process. The crew is helpless, but tries to keep cool. While preparing the cabin for departure several people start using the toilets meaning that during taxiing people are in the aisles. The flights are uneventful, although the last landing at MNL was quite rough. All in all not bad for the price paid, but an experience.

The quality of the seats, the restrooms were so worn-off and broken that I didn't really feel comfortable (though I'm not picky at all, but the restroom was a real experience towards the end of the flight). No entertainment (TV or music), of course, seats are not too comfortable either, but at least you can order food on board. Pretty limited selection in food unless you pre-order (strongly advised), drinks, snacks...but as it happened in my case, only 2 machines to pay by card, in my case BOTH broken.

Since they said the company likely won't allow it, the flight attendants shared their own meal pack with me (noodle pack) and I got from their water.

It would have been nice if this option were available to me to - would have saved me from having to buy food at ridiculous prices in Dubai airport. 3.

This flight was almost 10 hours long and it was incredibly uncomfortable. The restrooms were dirty and smelled bad. 4. When we landed in Manila, the captain announced that because of the red thunder, there would be a slight delay in de-boarding. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the terminal we were supposed to use for de-boarding was occupied by another airline because of the disruption of the thunderstorm. He said we would wait for 10-15 minutes. This went on for two hours, with him periodically announcing that it would only be another 10-15 minutes.

Once we got to immigration, the officer started checking the weight of our luggage. I’ve never seen an immigration officer check the weight for airlines because each airline have different standards. This was already sketchy to us because it felt like a scam.

As we had one booking, I needed to call 5J as I was not able to split the booking myself through their website. Calling them takes quite a while time, getting hold of them takes time. The agent I spoke to was friendly, providing me options within my case. As a rebooking for my travel companion was out of question listening to their options in our case, he decided to fly a different carrier! I was given the option that I could not refund the ticket although the ticket was refundable, instead I would be given a travel fund for 90 days! I was OK with that option cause I knew I would be flying again sooner. I asked the agent to split our booking and I was advised all further processes you can do through our website as you will be able now to change/rebook/cancel yourself online. I asked also the Travel Fund will be processed through my option to cancel and I was confirmed. Trusting the fact that I could manage all on my own, I did cancel the booking one day after in the knowing I will have a travel fund. What I was not told that the travel fund will now be only claimable under the surname of the booking carried in the booking! Which was now my travel companion and not mine. I paid all tickets and I did pay above 10.000PHP for this one way flight from Bohol to Manila.

When it gets delayed, it's usually due to long boarding process (around 15-30 minutes) because passengers need to be moved by a shuttle bus from gate to the aircraft. Meanwhile, the Manila-Jakarta leg lately was always on time. It's worth noting though that both flight schedule are considered off-peak hours of the airports. Cabin crew service are so-so. Some were nice, welcoming, but also some were not. Though, I am usually not expecting too much from a low-cost airline. When it comes to food, so far, I've only tried their Beef Tapa and Chicken Tocino. Nothing special honestly, and in fact it is overpriced. The serving is too small for it's price tag.

I concur from experience with much that has been written in complaints as warnings to prospective passengers, but the worst scam from Cebu Pacific, and most likely it is Company Policy, is their one of an “onward” or “return” ticket requirement. My partner and I have both experienced that demand from their check-in staff, yet from no other airline during our frequent travels. In one instance my partner's destination visa was clearly annotated “Return/onward ticket not required”, and we subsequently found that it was not possible to obtain a refund for the return ticket purchase demanded by check-in as a condition of boarding. I was told just several weeks ago that “return” ticketing (to where? country of departure or home country?) was a “requirement"" for my return to the Philippines, despite holding a 59 day visa as I have used regularly for 5 years, taking usually 4 flights every 2 months, almost exclusively with Cebu Pacific. On arrival at Manila I was granted entry, and no evidence of an outbound ticket was requested by the border staff. Both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bureau of Immigration suggest that this an ""airline requirement”, which means that everyone, every time they fly international routes with Cebu Pacific, may be scammed into purchasing a new ticket with no refund option, reschedule fees exceeding the value of a new booking, and only a smug reply from the Customer representative suggesting you “Put up and Shut Up”! My experience suggests that any further correspondence or discussion will be ignored. So if the check-in delays don’t steer you towards another airline; as untrained staff study the world’s immigration requirements, then check with their superior, before eventually accepting the next “Guest” from the queued backlog; maybe the very real likelihood of your ticket actually costing you twice as much as advertised, and reasonably expected, will find you seeking out an airline which cares just enough to complete your journey without further blackmail. I’m not willing to take that risk again, despite their cabin crew, aircraft, and timeliness being quite acceptable, as their admin staff and I-hate-to-call-them “managers” have finished them for me! I have seen many other passengers subjected to this same arrogant inconvenience and expense, our experience appears very common, but I’ve seen it only with Cebu Pacific check-in staff. Online booking hassles are a warning of things to come, both price changes and charge confirmation difficulties requiring calls to CP.

On Cebu Pacific, things go ok until they don't, and when they don't go ok, they become disastrous very quickly! I and two business companions booked a flight to Macau for an important business meeting in China. Instead of trying to make connections on the same day of the meeting, we broke the trip up into two days. We chose one day to travel and rest up for the meeting on the next day. We had a 3:00 PM flight to Manila and a connecting flight to Macau at 7:30 PM that evening. We were at the airport in Cebu at 1:30PM. Our flight to Manila was delayed 3 hours and when they finally told us we would be leaving we asked for help because there was no way we would be able to make our connection. The ground staff helped us by checking us in for the Macau flight and giving us our boarding passes so we could proceed quickly to the departure gate once we arrived in Manila. Then they told us they would notify Manila that were delayed and coming! However, when we got to Manila, we missed the connection! Turned out that no one in Cebu informed the gate personnel at the Macau flight gate that we were coming. The ensuing ""remedy"" made us extremely late for our China meeting, cost of over $1000 in extra expenses we should never have had, and aged us all by at least 10 years. We expected Cebu Pacific to transfer us to another carrier so that we could get over to Macau, but it turns out that Cebu Pacific does not have any relationships of that sort with other airlines. The extent of the ground staff's attempt to find us a flight was limited to scanning airline websites looking for possible flights for us. In the end we had no choice but to stay with Cebu Pacific and let them get us to Hong Kong (not Macau) the next morning. Several days after arriving home I filed a complaint and the result was an email messages saying how sorry everyone was for all the delays and hassles, but that an investigation concluded that personnel followed acceptable procedures in handling our situation. I guess saying that you are ""going to call ahead"" and then not calling ahead are considered to ""acceptable procedures"" for Cebu Pacific. Never again. Most of the staff were very great during our crisis, except for one representative, whom when we first arrived in Manila and were trying to get to the Macau flight gate as quick as possible, we approached for information about our Macau flight. After calling on his radio, he informed us that the plane had already pulled away from the gate and that we would have to ""go outside and buy another ticket"", without even so much as telling us how sorry he was that the company had caused us to miss our flight.

The flight from Taiwan to Manila was cancelled, they sent a friendly email saying there was an issue and they'd call us, The resulting call was on the Tuesday where they informed us that our Friday flight was cancelled (no indication of that in the email) and we could rebook. Our rebooking options were:  a flight that left in 5 hours time (1am Wednesday morning), or a flight that left on the following Tuesday (eliminating half of our vacation). We had to make an emergency booking with a different airline at great expense due to their issue. The flight from Manila to Sydney was delayed by an hour. The return leg flight Manila to Taipei was delayed by almost 3 hours, (it took off after the projected arrival time) there was no compensation offered, breaking Philippine airline regulations. At Ninoy Aquino Airport Terminal 3 we went through security, emptying our drink bottles, the Airport water fountains were empty/broken. At the boarding gate there was a bag search by airline staff emptying water bottles a second time to ensure that during the delay at the gate (with no bathroom access) and on the flight you would only have access to water you could purchase from the airline at ludicrous prices. Boarding the flight in Manila the aircon was on so high it looked like and felt like it was snowing presumably to increase blanket sales. The meals on the flight were terrible - Chicken Tangalad was a measly portion of oily chicken and indeterminate vegetables with far too much rice, Chicken Tocino was basically the same thing but with egg instead of vegetables. Our flight from Manila to Taipei was severely delayed (over 3 hours) after an hour and a half at the first gate a flight attendant yelled ""follow me"" and led a crowd of passengers to a different gate, then the airline staff placed a row of chairs in front of a door and locked all the passengers in, you could see passengers walk towards the entrance heading to the bathroom then turn around realizing they were trapped.

Early AM departure from ICN, but as this is the only Cebu Pacific flight at that time, no need to arrive 2-3 hours ahead. 1.5 hours was sufficient as ICN has long lines lately in the morning. Slightly late departure, but plane clean and in good condition with friendly, fast crew. Booked exit row seat both directions, but empty rows meant I could move and lay down without any problems. Also used transfer service sold online and onboard and would absolutely recommend. Only two complaints: cabin crew really focuses on selling snacks and drinks too frequently, even on our red eye home departing at 1.50 am with again another pass before arrival at 6 am. Also, they didn't actually black out the cabin for this flight, just dimmed the lights down to faint brown. This made sleep difficult. Seat tip: stretching out in the last row is difficult for any taller person (180 cm for me). The curvature of the plane means a much narrower seat row. Also, the crew has to stay awake, and as such talks throughout the flight in the rear galley. Kalibo airport is tiny and is recommended to use the free lounge across the street. In the evening, five flights to Korea within two hours means a hectic departure area and wait to get into the airport. Wait in the lounge until they call your flight about an hour and a half before departure. Much more comfortable. If using transfer service, you will arrive at 10 pm for 1.50 am flight.

We tried to travel on this airline twice, but one of the flights was cancelled, so this review is for the flight we did take, plus the service around the one we didn't. 1st flight (the cancelled one) - Manila to Caticlan (Boracay) 4 June. Arrived at the domestic airport more than 2 hrs before flight knowing Manila airport is a shocker, and wanted to make sure we allowed plenty of time. Joined a slow moving check in queue, wondering why our flight number wasn't displayed. At exactly 2 hrs before flight departure, a garbled voice announced over the PA ""Cebu flight DG6243 to Caticlan is cancelled"". This was both amusing and worrying, not just cancelled but definitely cancelled ? This was the first we'd heard of it. I happened to look at my phone and lo and behold, a helpful email at the same time alerts me to the cancellation as well. Made it to the front of the queue to be told to join another queue to organise another Cebu Pacific flight. Spending more time at Manila airport than necessary was not appealing, so decided to book another carrier and get a refund from Cebu instead. Misinformation and delays ensued. Ticket office to get refund located outside the terminal, and knowing our new flight would be closing in 30 mins, and stringent security to get back into the terminal, decided to lodge refund request by phone instead. Did this on 5 June, it was approved, and were told it would take a week. Two weeks later still waiting.  2nd Flight - Caticlan to Manila 10 June. Quick checkin this time, though for some reason it took 4 staff to do it ? All giggling and having a great time. Asked if we had a connecting flight from Manila (that should have been a dead giveaway, more later), told them yes, but in 6 hours. Bit of Spanish and more giggling ensued. Boarding passes given, which was a relief. Went upstairs to the waiting lounge and watched our flight go from On Time to Delayed before our eyes, as were all following flights. To be fair, the delay was caused by air traffic in Manila, but would have appreciated to be told at checkin. Flight ended up being only 45 mins delayed, and when the heavens opened, Cebu ground staff gave us umbrellas to walk across the tarmac. I'd booked seats in row 3 looking for a quick getaway, but of course, this particular plane only allowed boarding and disembarkation from the back! Service on board was pretty much non-existent due to the short 1 hr trip, which was fine by me. My hubby's seat was so old he had a steel rod poking him in the back, so he was bolt upright the whole time.

We did not pre-order any meals as they looked less than appealing but snacks were available and very reasonable prices. Great cabin crew always around if needed. Toilets kept clean and despite a full flight were never overcrowded. Very happy with this flight.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,,5,yes,3.0,0.0,,

As expected the flight got delayed a few times until it was announced that it was cancelled. Someone told us that usually if late afternoon flights are delayed chances are they get cancelled as Coron's airport does not have runway lights at night. We got shuttled to a hotel in the town proper and we were given 4 rooms which we refused as there were at least 5 families. We negotiated to be transferred to another (better) hotel which fortunately had the required 5 rooms. While this was a harrowing experience for us we were fortunate that their staff listened and attended to our needs. Cancelled flights are a big inconvenience esp when you are travelling with small children. We probably will never fly Cebu Pacific anymore.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,,3,no,0.0,0.0,,
cebu-pacific,315523,2015-04-16,,Hong Kong,,Cebu Pacific customer review,5J404 Apr 2nd and 5J405 Apr 9th. CEB seems to attempt promoting people to spend more time at the airport. For our recent family trip MNL to LAO they first informed by email and even followed up by call that the flight departure time was 1.5hrs earlier than scheduled. Just to let us then wait for almost 2hrs at a very crowded gate for the departure with a short note that the airplane had not yet arrived. We certainly would have found a better use in MNL for those 2hrs instead of waiting at the airport. It seems CEB starts their implementation of new schedules with informing their customers but only some time later also telling to the pilots and airport about it - interesting approach. Funny enough once we arrived in LAO the crew even announced proudly we arrived as scheduled! On the return flight they seemed to attempt to make up for it by departing 10min ahead of schedule from LAO. Leaves me wondering why they have a schedule at all?,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,2.0,,2,no,1.0,1.0,,

The usual complete chaos at Cebu Pacific check-in HK with insufficient check in staff and no organisation with a planeload of customers queuing for one Cebu flight desk up to the last minute whilst later CP flights were being also being checked-in. CP routinely boards from the satellite terminal which is a bus ride away from the main airport terminal. Stressful start to the journey.

While seat pitch is restricted somehow the A320 felt more roomy than on UL. The 5J flight crew (all female as is often the case) were very pleasant and had manners unlike some on UL. The annoying Cebu Pacific game is repetitive and the prize of a small pouch hardly anything to rave about. In contrast there is quite a good selection of reasonably priced snacks while the pre-ordering of hot meals has become quite popular.

Cebu Pacific announce proudly on their website when you book that they have a 69.1% punctuality rate for February! Onboard seating is comfortable and service is good though I do wish they would stop playing those silly games which can be annoying if trying to sleep on a night flight. There doesn't seem to be a consistent set of rules regarding use of ipads during flight. Some of the flights it was announced that it was ok to use ipads/ tablets if in flight mode throughout the flight from pushback to landing. On other flights they weren't allowed to be used till at cruising altitude. Since Cebu Pacific took over Tiger Air for domestic flights in the Philippines there now is really only Cebu Pacific of Philippine Airlines and as a result a number of routes have been cut completely and fares increased significantly. Cebu Pacific announced no more fuel surcharges however the price of flights increased so customers pay the same or more. When booking online beware of the add on's such as insurance / seat selection etc which are automatically added and must be removed by passenger if not wanted. Overall Cebu Pacific have good modern aircraft and provide a decent service just allow extra time (3 hours) for delays which almost always occur.,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,5.0,,4,yes,4.0,1.0,,

The night before we flew back we got an email to say our flight was cancelled and we were to call them to rebook or get a refund. We rang and could not get through to anyone. As a result we had to book a Philippines airline flight at our expense to ensure we got back to Manila for our connecting flight home a total disaster.

I finally get to Manila where I have a connecting flight to Hanoi. And it happens again. Gate changes twice flight delayed without any notification. No one at the gate to assist. No communication whatsoever on why we aren't boarding at the time indicated on our boarding passes. My flight ended up being delayed by over an hour again.

The fare cost AUD150.00. A competing carrier was offering a fare of AUD700.00. A nice touch was entering the aircraft into the cabin not via a galley which is standard of most aircraft designs. Entering directly into the cabin creates the impression of more space. The configuration of the Cebu Pacific A330-200 is tight with only 8 lavatories.

The planes were very quiet (new Airbus A330-300) seats were a little bit smaller and not as comfortable (harder) than AirAsia seats also the recline angle was not as generous but for the price and short distance who cares? A little over cautious on the final security check at the gate on our return flight from MNL total unnecessary (probably not their fault though but rather a requirement set by the Australian Government same thing happens in KL for example). This meant a delayed departure of about 40min they should have allocated more time prior to boarding.

Cebu lists low rates to get you started on purchasing a ticket by listing a super low price. By the time you're finished making the reservation it might be quite a bit more and by the time they finish ""nickle-and-diming"" you for all the ""extras"" you will have paid more for the flight. In my case I got a round trip ticket from Japan to Manila for what I thought would only be about $300 USD. By the time I finished checking in for my return flight I will have spent more than $700 USD in total. For an international flight that provided no food or water without extra payment. Everything about the flight is cheap. There are no movies no pillows no blankets if buy food on the flight they hand you a hot aluminium case of food (street vendor style) without a tray like other airlines do which makes it all to easy for things to drop away under other seats. In my case I only had so many Philippine Pesos left so I could only afford a dish to eat but couldn't get any water or anything at all to drink. Take my advice if you want a well priced flight that has transparent policies provides food and water during long international flights has movies to watch provides comfort in the cabin (with bedding and providing liquids to drink) choose another airline: for example ANA Singapore Air JAL United.

However thanks to Cebu Pacific for their timely departure from DXB and arriving 15 mins. early in MNL - could have been earlier without the usual traffic congestion in MNL.

During the last few weeks we have made 4 trips on Cebu Pacific and each one has been a challenge. 3 flights were delayed and 1 cancelled completely. Of the 3 which were delayed one to Caticlan was so late they ended up diverting to Kalibo as the airport was closed. As soon as anything goes wrong they are useless. I made 2 calls to them and spent over 2.5 hours trying to resolve problems and all you do is go round in circles. When you ask to speak to a manager they tell you there isn't one. If you insist eventually one appears. Their managers aren't any better though so there really is very little point. If they promise to email you don't believe them. They're unlikely to bother. Don't expect to be informed if you're flight is cancelled if you haven't got a local number. All in all if things go smoothly you may be ok. Once they start to go wrong you're in trouble.

Also cabin was not clean with pen marks on seat tray table and bits of chips fell while taking bag from overhead compartment. Return flight was on a new A330.

PROS: Cheaper fare than PR or SQ. Online check in (not available in PR) allows me more time to do more things before heading to the airport. Use of T3 instead of surly T1 or stuffy T2. CONS: Tight seats and poor pitch (you get what you pay for). Poor selection of in flight meals for purchase. This is most pronounced in flights scheduled during the lunch or dinner hours.

My last trip has prompted me to write as my flight was cancelled (again) we were bussed 1.5 hours to another airport to find that the flight there was delayed too (no announcement only found out when we asked). We were given no water for the bus journey the bus driver was constantly on the phone and driving with one hand even when changing gear and the food offered (or 150 pesos instead - $3) was pathetic. I feel sorry for their staff who constantly have to deal with upset passengers like me because their employer is so hopeless.

Ended up arriving in Manila 6.50 pm. Prior to departing Naga we had told the crew of our situation and they promised us that they will talk to the captain and other crew and that they will assist us with getting our check-in bag immediately instead of getting it from the carousel. However we discovered was that no one had communicated with any other crew members about us. They did not allow us to take our baggage right after stepping out of the plane; we had to wait for our baggage like everyone else. When we finally gathered our belongings we needed to run to catch a taxi to Terminal 1. Ended up missing our flight to Bangkok.

Flight left on time on both sectors clean cabin but with a broken tray table legroom is restricted and uncomfortable for a red-eye flight since most PAX reclining their seatbacks so it was hard to move. FAs were mixture of smiling and cheerful ladies down to bored but still polite crew and I like that they were proactive in turning on/off the reading lights for the PAX.

HKG has a well earned reputation as one of the best airports in the world. I love the fact that you can do web check-in with Cebu. It helps when you get to the airport and puts them above some other low cost airlines. Busy flight to MNL but flight on time and in-flight staff are excellent as I've experienced in the past with Cebu. Quick baggage delivery in MNL and terminal 3 is by far the best in MNL. Love the all over free wifi as in HKG. However the experience there during the return to HKG was not quite the same. Cebu staff managed to give us the wrong boarding card which we discovered after going through security (and the associated payment of airport fees). It got fixed but it was the first time I've ever experienced this sort of thing. Made for a stressful departure out of MNL. Better look closely at your boarding pass when flying Cebu. Inflight to HKG was exactly the same as before. Again a very busy flight but friendly in-flight staff and plenty of smiles.

Both flights were on time even late in the day but arrival into BKK was delayed because the pilot parked incorrectly and had to be pushed back to the correct position... Cabin Service was fine but the flights were quieter than usual I think because many passengers (me included) are flying Tiger from Clark to BKK because in some cases it's half the price of Cebu Pacific who are not significantly cheaper than Philippine Airlines on some routes.

Sat in premium seats up front (row 1) so leg room was definitely not a problem. Arrived in the Budget Terminal but one of the first to leave through Terminal 2 after the Budget Terminal's closure. I just wish they use the tube in Cebu when boarding. Some people tend to forget that 5J is a budget carrier hence buying everything on board the new Hot Meals being offered actually was pretty good a bit expensive but pretty tasty. Really made the cabin smell good. Only suggestion is that they could provide passengers with food trays so things don't get messy or the mess could be kept in the tray since 5J tables are pretty flimsy. Just remember to Bring a good inflight kit (Bedroom/Hotel Slippers Blanket Neck Pillow Eye shades ear plugs headset fully charged iPad and MP3 Player thick socks lip balm and probably something good to eat).

They are cheap unless you have extra bags or extra weight or make last minute changes or miss a plane out of Manila. (get to MNL airport early!). Sometimes the flight leaves before the posted time. Their website is frequently not working correctly. Tried to pay for extra bags and kept getting an error message until after it was past the deadline for adding bags. Then had to pay at the airport extra. You can expect a last minute gate change frequently and you can expect to walk or bus to Term 2 in Manila from the plane even though the plane is sitting right at the enclosed walkway. Carry-on policy is sporadic so going from an International flight to a domestic flight on Cebu Pacific can be tricky and costly.

Excellent on-time reliability on all flights. For some reason they do run the cabin temperature very cold on the A320 and this can be uncomfortable on a 3 hr+ flight.

cebu-pacific,315501,2011-06-17,,Philippines,,Cebu Pacific customer review,"Flew the MNL-MPH route. Flight to Caticlan delayed finally got on. Flight back to Manila cancelled. All other airlines for the day were fully operational but Cebu Pacific insisted our one flight was cancelled because of weather meaning ""force majeur"" which leads to the next part. The solution was 2 hrs on a public bus at our cost to go to Kalibo then fly to Manila when we could get a flight out with any of the other airlines operating out of Caticlan as they could handle the ""weather"". No refund for the flight cancellation because of ""weather was outside their control""!",,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315502,2011-06-14,7,Australia,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Seoul-Manila-Seoul satisfactory for a low cost airline. Check-in smooth. I didn't buy any food because it seemed mostly unappealing. The return flight was extremely turbulent and although the turbulence was obviously not the fault of the airline it would have been good to hear some kind of announcements of reassurance from the captain as the atmosphere in the cabin was very tense for most of the flight.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315503,2011-05-22,,Philippines,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Our flight was delayed over an hour going to Kuala Lumpur and over 40 hours going back to Manila! Cebu Pacific didn't even bother to book us for an overnight stay at a hotel. We also had to demand for every meal voucher that we were provided. In the plane they ran out of hot meals (instant cup noodles) and chips. Prior seat selections we had paid for were not honoured either. To top it all when we got back to Manila our luggage was missing!,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315504,2011-05-16,3,Australia,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Flights were in and out of Manila to Kalibo and also to Legazpi. While the prices are cheap and staff friendly the whole experience was a pain. Firstly the check-in at Manila is terrible. The queue seems to take forever as the staff are very slow which is not surprising as the admin and ticketing process they have is ridiculous. Multiple pieces of paper stapled together when just a boarding pass would suffice. At Manila expect to wait in line for at least an hour for check-in even if you are early. Every flight we took was at least an hour delayed this caused issues with our connections at the other end. The delays just seem to be a natural occurrence to Cebu Pacific which is probably why they offer no apology when they finally get round to notifying you of the delay. Once on board you can expect to wait quite a long time for the plane to actually leave as the runway traffic is very heavy at Manila.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315505,2011-03-27,7,Australia,,Cebu Pacific customer review,BKK-MNL was very good value for money. Paid for the extra legroom in Row 1 and also the extra 5kg. Very smooth check in and boarding and flight was on time. Crew friendly and there was food and drink available for purchase.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315506,2011-03-21,7,Australia,,Cebu Pacific customer review,MNL-KULh. Booked online from Australia with no problems. Seating somewhat cramped but OK for 3.5hr flight. Service onboard OK but not as friendly or /professional as Air Asia. Only paid A$90 so good value. Only problem was arriving at KUL LCC at 1am so stayed at Tune Hotel at LCC - very handy and cheap.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315507,2011-03-07,7,Philippines,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Flew with them on PPS ILO and CEB routes on A320 and A319 and they were okay. You may encounter some delays but most of the time I was with them flights were just few minutes behind the scheduled departure. Seats are a little bit cramped up but it's okay for short domestic flights. Was able to fly with them for as cheap as 1 USD and these great deals make Cebu Pacific emerge as one of the best low-cost airlines.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315508,2011-03-06,6,Belgium,,Cebu Pacific customer review,MNL-Cebu-Caticlan. Second flight was delayed for 9 hours. The ATR had technical problems and apparently Cebu Pacific did not have engineers to solve the problem. Staff were friendly and felt sorry for the delay: They even gave a voucher for a free flight to be used within 6 months. As I paid not even 3000 Php for both flights I can t complain.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315509,2011-03-04,8,Australia,,Cebu Pacific customer review,I've flown a few times - mainly between MNL DVO and CEB. Most times I've booked the flights from Australia and had no issues with the website or pricing. Airport experience does tend to be somewhat chaotic but onboard experience is fine. Comfortable and clean aircraft with cheerful crews. Since they're basically all short haul flights I don't mind about food or amenities.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315510,2011-02-11,2,Macau,,Cebu Pacific customer review,"There should be a body to review how Cebu Pacific do business online it's not much short of fraud. Almost every time I book on line the ultimate response is ""cannot process your card"" and every time you try again the price increases. In November I was booked on a Tiger flight from Clark Philippines to Singapore take off at 12.20. Tiger cancelled at 11.00am and accepted no responsibility for this. The Cebu Pacific flight taking off at 12.10 was only half full and put their price up immediately from 3950 pesos to 15000 pesos. Am I the only one who thinks this sort of practice is criminal?",,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315511,2011-02-04,2,Thailand,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Cebu to Manila A319. Checkin very slow and seemed quite disorganised. Although aircraft was new seating very tight and uncomfortable. I was assigned a window seat on the last row which had no window and was so cramped that it proved to be one of the worst seats I have had to endure. It was impossible to sit in a normal fashion as my knees were pinned against the seat in front of me. I understand Cebu Pacific are a budget airline but I would eagerly pay more not to endure such seating again.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315512,2011-01-03,,United States,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Cebu Pacific has low published fares but by the time you pay for seating excess luggage any snacks including water and Anything else you are paying about the same as PAL. Couple this with the arrogant staff and it is not worth it. After my last trip I have decided that even if Cebu Pacific were free I would not use it. The last flight of my last trip was modified online and changed to a later time and I went through the payment process. When checking in I was told that no record existed and because I had missed my previous flight I would have to buy a new and much more expensive ticket. Having no choice I did so but will never fly them again. Their online booking system is so full of holes that you are taking a big risk with your credit card by using it.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315513,2011-01-02,,United States,,Cebu Pacific customer review,We had to cancel our flight with CEBU one week before we traveled due to a work emergency and they charged us approx 50% fee to do so then would only refund the remaining 50% in travel credit which must be used in 90 days. This company is predatory we were very disappointed in their policy.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315514,2010-12-14,7,United States,,Cebu Pacific customer review,MNL-CGY-CEB-CGY. Wesbite was good though had some issues with it they accepted our Master Card. Check-In took forever because there were 11 of us; however; check-in agent was friendly and helpful. Terminal 3 is excellent leaps and bounds better than T1. Boarding was chaotic as ever on an A320. Seats comfy cabin was new and clean. Legroom was awful. FAs were unfriendly and robotic no smiles at all. Good BOB options good prices. Though a complimentary drink would be nice. CGY-CEB-CGY on a smaller ATR-72 both flights were uneventful. Both flights were departed and arrived nearly 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin were once again spotlessly clean FAs same we had the same FA on both legs sort of friendly. Had some games which was appreciated. Overall Cebu Pacific is a true lowcost carrier. I would use PR next time for more class and comfort.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315515,2010-12-06,9,United Kingdom,,Cebu Pacific customer review,BKK-MNL-BKK twice in the past 4 months. On time departures and arrivals on all flights. No problems with ticketing and some very good prices to be had compared to PAL and Thai. Usual zoo of a check-in in BKK with people messing around with excess baggage and not being prepared to pay for it. MNL much better. No real complaints with Cebu Pacific - good value and I'll continue to use them.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315516,2010-08-07,,Switzerland,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Cebu - Manila: My online reservation could not be accessed by staff at the airport. I was offered to take the same flight at almost three times the price I would have paid if my booking had registered correctly! The print-out of my e-ticket was considered irrelevant. Shaking heads and shrugging shoulders were the reactions I got from Cebu Pacific staff. I decided to use another airline. Despite some okay experiences with Cebu Pacific on previous occasions I will never use it again.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315517,2010-06-17,9,United Kingdom,,Cebu Pacific customer review,BKK-MNL-BKK. Flights a little quieter in recent weeks due to the problems in Thailand. Quite large variations in price depending on precisely which days you travel. Cebu Pacific used to have very good last minute prices - not any more and the cost to change a travel date was about the same price as the original ticket. They're also cracking down hard on excess baggage - 15kg for checked in bags and 7kg hand carry. Don't expect to haggle an extra few kilos for free - and they're checking (weighing) bags again at the gate. I'll continue to use them in favour of PAL or Thai since their prices are still very competitive their reliability in my experience has been very good and NAIA-3 is by far the best MNL Terminal - just don't carry too much luggage.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
cebu-pacific,315518,2010-06-14,,Philippines,,Cebu Pacific customer review,When we decided to fly from Cebu to Caticlan (Boracay) we were hesitant to fly Cebu Pacific because of horror stories we heard but opted to give it a chance. We booked and purchased our ticket 3 months in advance. Between that date and the flight date Cebu Pacific called 3 times to change the time of departure. The worst thing happened when they called 6 days before the actual flight date and told us the flight would be cancelled and they would fly us to Kalibo (3 hours away from Caticlan by bus). The airline rep tried to appease us by providing a free bus ride from Kalibo to Caticlan however this would mean we would arrive in Boracay past 7pm instead of the original schedule of 3pm. This in effect wasted 1 entire day and meant we paid for 1 night's hotel stay which was useless. Having no other recourse we agreed but to our horror upon arriving in Kalibo the bus they prepared from Kalibo to Caticlan was not big enough to accommodate all passengers. They had to fit all 13 of our group into 1 small van. Needless to say we have all vowed to never fly this airline again.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,
cebu-pacific,315519,2010-05-13,9,United Kingdom,,Cebu Pacific customer review,Gensan-Manila. A pleasant flight staff a bit scarce but helpful and nice. Aircraft was clean. Flights can be delayed but that is not just Cebu. A good low cost airline to get around the Philippines.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
