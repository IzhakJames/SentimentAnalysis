"Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata. As  faultless flight except for a long-standing problem: no Arrival Cards onboard the flight for foreign nationals thus delaying, on arrival in Calcutta the immigration process. Repeated requests over these past many years have yielded no positive result.",0
"First, when trying to manage our booking, it didn't accept our booking ref.no., but it accepted the e-ticket number. Our flight is from Phnom Penh to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur (self check-in in KL). It only gave me itinerary for the flight from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur and only for one traveler, altough there are two of us. While trying to manage our booking, the booking confirmation was sent to a weird and suspicious e-mail and my contact number was removed and changed into a Chinese phone number. After I changed this strange e-mail to my e-mail address, I received the booking confirmation in Chinese only. All this made us very suspicious and we tried to contact AirAsia office with a number from their website. However, the phone operator informed me that this number doesn't exist. We are now not sure what to do.",1
"My flight from Bandung to Surabaya was on time. I did check-in online and it was ok, unfortunately I could not choose my seat, I think it's because LCC airlines. Boarding process was fast and efficient. The cabin was a bit dirty. We arrived safely and on time.",0
"Their on time performance is best in India and so was my experience, departed on time and reached before time. Boarding experience was ok, T1 at Mumbai is little congested so not proper space to board in proper queue. Aircraft was clean and fresh, cabin crew were courteous. Seats are ok for short flights.",0
Flew Melbourne to Bangkok in Business class. We've flown Business Class with 5 other much more costly carriers in the past. Got to say we were very impressed with Jetstar. The cabin staff were the friendliest and most attentive! The service faultless. The food was great I had a black pepper steak with fried rice and steamed greens. The wines 4 selections were acceptable and they weren't stingy about top ups. They give you iPad's for the entertainment which with the superb headphones was good listening. The only downside is that the iPad adds to the limited space available on your tray come meal time. Would definitely fly with them again and the savings made mean Suite upgrades at the destination.,0
"My trip to Singapore is only for 6 days and Scoot delayed the flight 1.5 days. Cant contact by phone from 11pm despite there is 24 hours contact. Cant get any information and can change the flight sooner because your manage is not updated. So angry because they delay this by 1.5 days without any repay, just apologies and we don't need their apologies. Worst airline ever.",1
"Penang to Singapore. Very impressed with Air Asia staff. Due to the Covid19 our 13-year-old son had to fly alone on an emergency flight as his boarding school was being closed with no notice. The staff helped him check-in, put him in 1C (yes, I'm jealous) and escorted him through arrivals and immigration where he had to undergo a medical check and be issued with a stay at home notice. I am so thankful that AirAsia staff looked after him. Well done!",0
DPS-PER (Indonesia Air Asia) - hard to find fault the plane was clean flight was on time prepaid meal was small but delicious. I paid $117 just 3 weeks before including baggage meal and extra leg room - less than I paid for an internal flight in Indonesia. The only thing I would suggest is they could accept credit card payment in-flight at least for duty free purchases.,0
"Another good flight by Scoot. This was the second leg of my flight getting me back home to Perth. I paid a little extra for the ""Scoot in Silence"" area, but I should not have bothered, because I think at the most there were fifty passengers on this flight. Cabin crew were happy and friendly as usual, but I think also a little bit bored because the aircraft was so lightly loaded. A smooth flight, but we hit the usual turbulence when we got to the top end of Western Australia. Despite this, the aircraft landed right on time at Perth airport. I did not purchase any extra for this flight, so I can't really comment any further. Price of the flight was good, in my opinion, definitely value for money. One has to also keep in mind that Scoot is a budget airline, so remember not to set your expectations too high.",0
Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8322 21 Mar 2014 DMK-CGK (A320). Website check-in is convenient check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in DMK is Manual and the staff check recheck and re- recheck if you have boarded or not. Crew welcoming and point to your seat. Announcements so fast no one can understand them. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food looks like it has been recycled on 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Pak Nassers Nasi Lemak) as I'm allergic to fish however the meal included Anchovies. Again on landing the announcements were so fast that we all just looked at each other in a daze. Overall I will fly them again but will bring my own food and water.,0
Do not book with this airline. Cancel flights and they do not care how get to your destination to the point they direct you to another airline! The most absolute rude and unhelpful staff. I still haven't got my refund for the cancelled flight 10 days later. Dirty planes. Never again.,1
Early morning service from Christchurch - Wellington with Jetstar Airways. Check in fast but the check in staff were not the most welcoming. Boarded on time. Crew were great and friendly. Departed on time. Ticket price included a $10 voucher for which I got a hot beverage and a snack served by were friendly crew. Landing into WLG was very choppy and turbulent. However the flight deck crew did a good job. Arrived into WLG a few minutes early. Bags took a whilst to arrive at WLG. Overall a very reasonable flight that exceeded expectations.,0
"I cancelled my flights in advance for medical reasons. I had different flights booked with Cebu Pacific and Scoot. After sending emails, hours of calls over the phone, i received one of the refund but the other one after calling again the company and sending emails, never got any response. My flight was Manila to Gold Coast via Singapore. The first one was suppose to be done and then transfer. After calling Cebu, they told me i need to coordinate first with the other company because they are also involve with the transfer. I then called the other company and they told me exactly the same. I need to call to coordinate the refund. 2 months waiting. Never got any answers to my emails after 2 months Even after several follows-ups. I called again in august to know where is my money I insisted to talk to the manager and lady told me they will call me back within 24 hours. They confirmed my phone number and extension +32 for Belgium. So was waiting, waiting and waiting and no one called back. So i called back and again the same. Thats the worst customer service i ever seen.",1
"Charged $120 for baggage excess (7.4kg for me and 7.9kg for my wife). Rude, unhelpful staff. Made us pay just minutes before boarding in a very pressured way.  Not ""everyday low prices"" but everyday extra charges. I will never fly Jetstar again, nor recommend it to friends.",1
"Terrible experience, they count every gram of luggage. Have to do the pathetic reshuffling of bags at the last minute which is pointless over 300 grams. Customer service poor.",1
"This flight from Melbourne to Townsville was booked on Qantas points but, despite having the Jetstar reservation code, it wasn't possible to check in online. At Melbourne Airport check-in and bag drop using the kiosks at Terminal 4 was very quick. The terminal itself is quite pleasant, but there was a very long walk to the gate (some elderly passengers complained to the crew about this). We had seats 1A and 1B at the front by the aircraft exit, and as there was no bulkhead we had a huge amount of legroom. The crew were efficient and friendly, and the snack we purchased on board was fine. The flight left 15 minutes late but arrived on time. Overall quite a pleasant experience.",0
"Dont waste your money and time. Jetstar has increasingly become worse each year. We have had four flights cancelled. You end up paying more for accomodation when your flight is cancelled - once after a 12 hour wait, they wanted to send us back home! We had to argue to get a cheap, dirty accomodation organised near the airport. The next time another flight was cancelled and we were offered accomodation and we said, NO. Never trust where they put you. While waiting around at the airport you also spend so much money for food and lose your precious holiday time. Better to spend a little more and secure your holiday and business travels with other reliable airlines. The worst is the staff and clearly their lack of quality training. They have no desire to help you out, inform you promptly and show a compassionate attitude during cancellations. They are slow as turtles on land and couldnt care less about customer care. We have had three flights cancelled due to engineering issues. Their aircrafts are unreliable and the engineers unable to deliver speedy and quality repairs. How can they have so many issues so often?? I feel scared to get on their planes. We will never fly with Jetstar again. Not only are the prices cheap - all other aspects of Jetstar is cheap. Dont waste your money and time.",1
"Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. Experience above expectation. Comfortable seats, temperature just right. Very friendly and serviceable staff. Tasty and very cheap food. Pleasant flight.",0
They overcharged me for my luggage even though I was entitled to the bags I had. They blamed it on their system and said that the only way for me to get my bags there was to pay and hope for a refund later. Afterwards it was impossible to get the money back.,1
"Hanoi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Worst seats I have experienced in a plane. Be sure to choose a seat that's possible to recline. The distance between the seats are tiny. Me and my girlfriend got seats as far away from each other as possible. Asked if it was possible to get a seat next to each other but no. Even I saw later that there were two seats next to each other.  The Airasia part in KLIA is also bad, really crowded and not many places to eat/shop.",1
"Melbourne Avalon to Sydney. The Jetstar check-in staff at Avalon airport weighed my hand luggage and said I was 2kg over. I carried exactly the same stuff I brought from Sydney last night on a full flight and there wasn't an issue. Jetstar at Avalon wanted $60 for 2kg of extra luggage.  I told them that I could have put on 2kg in one day and it wouldn't make an iota of difference. The staff were rude and uncooperative. This is the only authority they have in the real world and it goes to their head. So I had to go through my laptop bag, throw out some paperwork I will have to reprint back at the office and put about a kg of stuff (such as USB drive, small batteries, etc) into my pockets. All because of pig-headed Jetstar staff.",1
"Our Scoot flight from Perth to Singapore was passable, but the return pretty horrendous and one of the worst flights I've ever been on! Ground staff in Singapore were great and check in very smooth but it was all downhill from there. Boeing 787's are considered to be fairly new but this fleet is looking very worn and the plane was not terribly clean either. Legroom is good (by budget standards) but armrests are tiny and we were repeatedly clicking the overhead light on by accident. Could not decipher many of the announcements due to the poor English and very heavy accents of the attendants. Flight was very turbulent for most of the journey too which didn't help.  If you must travel Scoot, get a seat in the 'quiet zone', or towards the front of the aircraft - even if you have to pay extra. Also, you can bid on business seats and 'win' an upgrade for as little as $100 from what I have heard.",1
"Denpasar to Manado via Surabaya. We waited over 2 hours in Bali and was told first it was a technical issue and would be 15 minutes then 30 mins and so on till over 2 hours later we left for Surabaya. Lion staff would have known for sure that we would miss Our connecting flight from Surabaya to Manado but still sent us. We landed and after 1 hour was told yes, we had missed the flight and would now spend the night at the Ibis Budget hotel in a tiny cigarette smelling room. We lost our hotel accommodation in Manado. Also connecting flight next day to Tenate and hotel room for the next night. All because Lion air failed. Very dissappointing.",1
"I am en route back from Singapore to Phnom Penh with Air Asia after learning much to my disgust what Air Asia means by ""point to point"" service. I flew from Yangon to Singapore and expected - to be able to get a boarding pass from Yangon to Singapore and check my bags through. I am an experienced traveler and fly constantly. When I landed in KL I was to my surprise required to go through immigration and customs in Kuala Lumpur pick up my bag check through the confusing Air Asia terminal recheck my bags and then go through the whole process to get on to Singapore. As I had bought a ticket from Singapore to Phnom Penh with only 90 minutes between flights - plenty of time for a normal carrier not for Air Asia's bizarre system - I had to change my return flight pay them $55 USD for the pleasure of spending 4 hours in the horrible Air Asia Terminal. They impose a huge burden on customers doing this. The Air Asia web site is excellent - and if they wanted the could easily alert customers that 90 minutes is not enough time to go through their transfer system but of course they do not. Don't fall for it.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. The second time I took Jetstar for interstate travel. Never taking their service again. Terrible behaviour by staff, rude and arrogant. I was asked to keep my phone away and after the first request, I was told that my phone will be confiscated. Never faced such troubles in any airline across the entire world.",1
"Horribly expensive with an awful experience. You wind up paying more than other airlines because the baggage price is astronomical. Additionally, you get to watch people get served hot meals while you receive nothing. It really makes you feel like a second-class citizen. And of course, no wifi.",1
"Flew IndiGo for the 12th time (three visits to India with an aircraft change in Kolkata outward and inward) in the space of 12 months (Bkk-Kol-Pune-Kol-Bkk) and IndiGo does a very good job from start to finish. From checking in to the cabin crew to smiling pilots who say byebye when leaving the plane. The planes are clean, the seating is fine (I am 5'10"" and slim) as each flight is around 2-1/2 hours. Boarding is efficiently done, and every departure and arrival was on time. The fact that baggage takes time to arrive is probably beyond the airline's control.",0
The flight was ok however they lost my checked baggage. It is four days now and so far all I have got is an email telling me they cant find it. The people I have dealt with are very polite typical of Japanese but the lack of any progress is very concerning and has made the ski holiday a nightmare. I would not normally fly a low cost carrier for exactly this reason but was recommended the flight by the travel agent. I was sceptical but decided to go ahead with them on advice from the travel agent. Be warned if everything goes ok and your bags arrive with you you might save a few bucks but if they do the same to you as they have to me any cost savings are insignificant compared to the problems trying to retrieve your lost bags.,1
"Cebu Pacific lost my luggage after making me check it in on my return flight. Flights delayed, small aircraft, no communication, everyone's trying but no one clearly tells you what to expect. Did not bring my luggage on the aircraft and ended up having it shipped to my connecting flight in Thailand, 12 days after I had left the Country and had to purchase everything again. Today, it's been 7-months since I've come back. After 80 emails in this ongoing thread to dispute and get my compensation for the lost luggage, no response after 1.5 months. Very unreliable, I just hope someone would give me a status on my flight.",1
Ranchi to New Delhi. Good service. Even though its a lost cost airline but the service was good. Professional staff and well mannered. Aircraft was pretty neat and clean with good aroma through out the journey.,0
CGK-DPS (Dec 9) and DPS-CGK (Dec 12) flight. The first stint was on time but the later one about 10 minutes delayed although eventually we arrived only 5 minutes late. Everything in general very good.,0
"Delayed 2 hours leaving Sydney due to late inbound arrival, I was able to use my American Express card for Lounge Access which helped. Aircraft 2 months old so very clean. Scootbiz was acceptable for 8 hour flight. The food was ok (upgraded to premium meal). Cabin staff worked hard and were friendly. Would fly Scootbiz again.",0
"Cebu Pacific is a low-cost carrier, and their flights are usually quite cold. The food you can book in advance or purchase onboard is not great, but will do considering the low price. Their ground service announcements should improve. They beat their competitors when it comes to price, if you are only on a short flight. On the aircraft, staff is usually friendly, but no entertainment system whatsoever.",0
Flew Jetstar Tokyo to Sydney via gold coast. Flight was delayed by an hour. I tried to buy drinks on the plane and staff rudely informed me that they don't take cash (AUD or JPY) and only credit cards which I didn't have. To be fair the flight was a lot cheaper than any of the other full service airlines but you get what you pay for. Flew back to Tokyo on Air NZ a few weeks later and was amazed at the difference. Chalk and cheese. Seats are uncomfortable and have minimum legroom (even on a large aircraft such as the A330). Cabin crew are rude (and their polyester polo shirt uniforms are awful). Check in staff appear to be overworked. For short haul flights Jetstar are OK but for anything longer than 4 hours your better off going with a full service airline.,1
"Christmas vacation in Boracay with friends. Early AM departure from ICN, but as this is the only Cebu Pacific flight at that time, no need to arrive 2-3 hours ahead. 1.5 hours was sufficient as ICN has long lines lately in the morning. Slightly late departure, but plane clean and in good condition with friendly, fast crew. Booked exit row seat both directions, but empty rows meant I could move and lay down without any problems. Also used transfer service sold online and onboard and would absolutely recommend. Only two complaints: cabin crew really focuses on selling snacks and drinks too frequently, even on our red eye home departing at 1.50 am with again another pass before arrival at 6 am. Also, they didn't actually black out the cabin for this flight, just dimmed the lights down to faint brown. This made sleep difficult. Seat tip: stretching out in the last row is difficult for any taller person (180 cm for me). The curvature of the plane means a much narrower seat row. Also, the crew has to stay awake, and as such talks throughout the flight in the rear galley. Kalibo airport is tiny and is recommended to use the free lounge across the street. In the evening, five flights to Korea within two hours means a hectic departure area and wait to get into the airport. Wait in the lounge until they call your flight about an hour and a half before departure. Much more comfortable. If using transfer service, you will arrive at 10 pm for 1.50 am flight. Ask for help if you don't speak Korean as no English was used (I can speak Korean).",0
"Gold Coast to Sydney. The last 4 flights I have booked with Jetstar have been cancelled. The staff on the ground are never to blame - they are rushing around working hard to try and make up for the fact that Jetstars systems are awful, they are understaffed, their facilities and resources are run down, and there is a general lack of organisation across the board with their flights. It honestly seems like they intentionally cancel flights so they can squeeze more people into empty flights, hence saving money. They wait until the last minute to tell you so they can be sure the threshold number of seats that would make the flight profitable is not achieved. When you book a flight with this airline you are buying a seat but never actually buying the flight time you think you are. Cancellations and delays will occur, and you will be shuffled around repeatedly by overworked and stressed staff. If they advertised themselves as youll get a seat to your destination when it suits us and is profitable for us and this may mean repeated delays and cancellations then the consumer would know what they are actually buying. They are not an option for convenience, reliability, good customer service or transparency.",1
"The worst customer service I've ever experienced. I bought 2 tickets, one normal and one flexible through flight network and I had a work emergency. I cancelled my flight 3 weeks prior, according to their website they charge 400INR for cancellation when cancelled up to 4 days before the flight. I started the cancellation with flight network and it was immediately bad as they told me my flexible ticket didn't work on cancellation although I found a different information on the website (in some places it says it doesn't work, in others says it works), I emailed IndiGo and they told me my ticket was not flexible (I paid for flexi), anyway, after dozens of emails complaining, I decided to cancel anyway and pay the fee. No refund was processed. I asked to talk to someone in the complaints department, no refund the was processed so I emailed them again. I added attachments of all my conversations with the company and flight network, and they replied saying they would refund me. No refund was done so I emailed them again and received a ridiculous email they would refund me with no-show ammount (10% of my payment) which is unacceptable. I will never fly with them or book a ticket again.",1
"We were checked in at flight GK109 from Tokyo to Sapporo. 15 minutes before boarding time we recognized some problems because Japanese passengers were discussing something with Jetstar airline staff heavily. No one spoke English but I understood the word 'canceled'. I asked for a manager to come, but they say we had to go to the check-in hall again for check-out. To make the story short no assistance, no information, no help was provided. I understand this is cheap airline but also the worst, try Air Asia which has excellent staff and organization for comparison.",1
"I was travelling from Delhi to Vadodara in July 2018 through Indigo. Unfortunately, our flight from San Francisco to Delhi (Via Shanghai) got delayed and we missed the 5:10 am flight from Delhi to Vadodara. The Indigo staff at terminal 2 acted very helpful. They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi. We barely reached to Terminal at 6:35 am. We had to get our tickets modified, checked in and boarding passes printed by 6:40 am to get into the Ahemdabad flight. That is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state. I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed. In couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance. She ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast. Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time! Then she ran with us to the security area, asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate. We got to the gate as last passengers entering! We could not have done it without this staff. We now realized why Indigo is such a great airline. it is because of the great employees.",0
MNL-TPE return and MNL-BKK return on A319/320. The tickets were cheap and paid extra for the exit row with no recline. All flights departed and arrived on time. Nothing noteworthy just standard low cost flights. The only downside was the 'currency game' played by the crew with passengers. On a daytime flight its fine but at 2am it can be irritating. Also flew MNL-MPH return. The flight there cancelled we notified a supervisor about transfer worries and she was excellent and put us on an earlier MPH flight than we had originally booked. Unfortunately our flight home was cancelled this time due to the weather. Like all low cost carriers you get what you pay for.,1
"Singapore to Denpasar. This was the worse experience I had. I booked my ticket and Jetstar sent me a confirmation email like usual, they charged my credit card right away, also like usual. On the day of the flight I came to do check in and they had cancelled my flight 2 days earlier and didnt even bother to send me an email. Not to mention the money wasnt refunded to my credit card. They told me it was cancelled and they process a refund and if I wanted to fly I needed to buy a new ticket.",1
"Melbourne to Manila. Flight was supposed to be at 5:30pm. Boarding time has been delayed multiple times then flight eventually got cancelled at 10pm. Poor communication with in terms of delays/changes causing frustration to passengers. Had a bad customer service in Feb 2019 and thought the airline has improved hence booking another flight but still, they have poor customer service.",1
Singapore Changi to Bangkok Don Muang. Flight departed on time and landed right on schedule. Got allocated the last row (42) which sadly could not recline but still not too bad for a short flight although having no one in the middle seat helped. Crew were polite and courteous - no more no less. Surely would fly with Scoot again in the future!,0
Jetstar Japan: I flew Sapporo - Narita return in May 2013. Tickets were 3960 yen each way and I paid an extra 800 yen per flight for an exit row seat. Both flights were on time and in new A320's with a nice interior. For a short flight with the exit row seats I was more than comfortable. At less than $100 USD for a round trip to Tokyo I am very happy that low cost airlines are now flying in Japan and I will most definitely fly them again.,0
I flew from Delhi to Chennai. Good legroom space and good service by the cabin crew. The flight arrived early.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Yangon. Flight on time, cabin crew friendly, pre-ordered meal arrived on time and hot, additional purchase prices for beverages are reasonable, pilots are informative, and your seats can recline on this budget airline in the newest aircraft. The fare is also very competitive. I could not ask for more. The only downside is KLIA2, low cost airport which is a shame, but this is not airline's fault.",0
"I will start but saying that if you are thinking of flying this airline, please dont and pay a little extra for a better company, that doesnt hide extra fees. I flew from Siem Reap to Bangkok, I have been travelling with a backpack that has been accepted by every single airline (as it is 40L), but because it was slightly over 7kg I was charged 50 usd and forced to check it in.",1
"Jetstar is a non nonsense airline with everything pretty what you would expect for a low cost carrier. The flight from Auckland to Wellington was a great price and I choose the ""add ons"" that I needed. The snack was pleasant enough for the short flight, the small cup of water could have been a little bottle, but again it is a short flight and I had my own. Seats are tight and limited leg room, same as any other carrier really. Cabin crew were efficient, knew who had pre ordered, they made eye contact used your name little things that made the flight a little more relaxed and friendly.",0
"Ridiculously unfair fare rules which is not cost-effective for passengers to make any flight amendment. I requested to change to an earlier flight with the same departure date yet was appalled by the ridiculous charges which is equivalent to a return ticket for the same route, making it ridiculously cost-ineffective to make any changes to my booking. The airline has a strict ""no-waiver"" policy which is out to ""eat"" (take advantage of) customers, Scoot is an airline which does not put customer first, and is just a very unempathetic business which fare rules are outright unreasonable. The customer service support is terrible as they would dismiss your emails and do not give a dam about your urgent email request. The hotline staff are reluctant to go the extra mile by escalating your request to the management for serious consideration. They do not care about the passengers satisfaction. I would not recommend this low cost carrier Scoot to anyone. I highly urge the public that they should not choose this airline if they foresee any possible changes to their flight schedule, and I would strongly advice you to book with a full-cost carrier. The pilots are not skilled, always a hard landing, bad at managing turbulence, super bumpy flight all the time. Air stewardess are unprofessional and not service-oriented, reluctant to help passengers with putting their luggage in the overhead cabin. The cabin toilets are poorly maintained, super dirty and gross. The seats are dirty, uncomfortable, poor support for the back. Overpriced food and drinks.",1
Flew from MNL-Cebu. One hour flight without problems in a new plane and plenty of legroom.,0
"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. I realize this is a budget airline so my level of expectation was already quite low. Ive been flying with them every week for work and the staff, particularly the ones at the ground are one of the worst Ive seen. Has no organized policy or set manuals- will charge you extra fees randomly or make your life miserable based on how they feel that day.  If you complain, they will not apologize nor will they at least try to look into your issue. All youll get is an attitude or even worse they may make your life more miserable.",1
"Bangalore to Pune. A lack of organisational and communication skills and ticket counter staff had no idea how to handle awkward customers. I arrived at the airport with enough time to check in, the counter staff was dealing with a customer who missed her flight and this lasted over 15 minutes and meant that even though I was fast tracked to the front of queue I missed my flight - despite the flight not departing for another 40 minutes. I was told that I had to rebook a fresh flight at the cost of 17,500INR, which was then reduced to 3,600INR after I complained and explained the situation.",1
"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. Absolutely terrible, invasive staff. I was on my way to custom check out, Scoot staff me to check our hand carry luggage, we had 4kg extra and the staff wanted me to pay the price for 20kg. I was completely fine with the process, until I told the staff I would reduce the weights, she went ahead and took our boarding pass away. I was furious, never in all of my flight had somebody took our boarding pass while waiting to sort out the luggage. I'm also Scoot frequent flyer. The services and regulations are vastly inconsistent.",1
"Honolulu to Sydney. I do not like Jetstar at all. Ive been flying for years and years now and they are the only airline Ive experienced that does not offer complementary drinks and weighs your personal bag and carry on.  Also the inflight entertainment cost money so I had nothing to do for my 10 hour flight. Every other airline Ive been on, if they have it, it has been complementary. The flight attendants returning home were extremely rude when I politely asked for a cup of water! I will not be flying with Jetstar again in the future.",1
"Queenstown to Sydney. Worst airline, flown with Jetstar twice and both times something went wrong, therefore never again. First flight luggage issues, second and last flight was delayed 8 hours, their compensation was an $8 food voucher which is so petty and is no where near equivalent to wasting my whole day, they are a stingy airline that does not care about their customers.",1
I did six flights with AirAsia Indonesia and AirAsiaX from Sydney KL Makassar Denpasar Makassar KL Sydney. I found the airline to be exactly up to my expectations. It's a budget no frills low airfare airline. I'm not too tall 1.8m and not too fat 73 kgs so it was fine for me. The food was good and if I didn't want any extras I didn't have to pay for them. It was about half the fare on Jetstar/Qantas. Neither of which went to my main destination of Makassar.,0
Phuket to Singapore. Not good enough Scoot. After arriving 3 hours early; were informed of 2 hour delay; approximately 40 mins before planned departure. Budget does not mean no charge! Very disappointed,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya with AirAsia. The flight departed and arrived on time. The ground staff for check in were not very efficient as there were only some counters that open and the ground staff were quite slow to handle the passengers. The cabin staff were kind and helpful. The seat was standard of LCC. The nasi padang that me and my family bought was delicious. Overall, my experience with AirAsia was quite nice.",0
"I went to my gate entrance for my domestic flight at 2.15 when my flight is at 2.50. At the time, when the officer scanned my boarding pass the machine said ""not checked in"" even thought I clearly had the boarding pass. The officer said to try again in 5 minutes and the same result kept coming up until 15 minutes had passed and now the result became ""too late to board"". The officer told me to go to the service counter and they kept sending me to different service counters until I reached the rudest lady who initially told me that I can't board within 20 minutes of take off, even though I was at the gate 35 minutes before take off. I kept begging her to help me but all she said was ""please step aside, sir. I'm busy"". That was 5 minutes prior to the supposed take off and of course I missed the flight. After all of this I had to go retrieve the bags I checked in and that took over 20 minutes, at which time I found out the flight had been delayed by 40 minutes. I have to wait for the delayed flight to depart before I can take back my checked in bags. What kind of customer service is this? Also I was informed that they may help me with rescheduling the flight if I pay the difference even though 1 AirAsia employee told me it was the system's fault.",1
"Not highly recommended. After I use my return flight, i promise not to book in this airline. Never imagined I have to pay my hand carry because it was excess as they claimed? My 1 luggage hand carry weighed 9kg (10kg minimum) but they added my personal belongings backpack? And paid 270aed.",1
Perth to Singapore. Check in was swift. We had a slight delay due to no fault of Scoot but the incident was actioned quickly by the airport staff and we started boarding 30mins after the departing time. I was in the Scoot Silence zone and it was pleasant without much noise; you will still hear some from the other section. Having a headrest definitely helped. Cabin was clean and I did not have to interact with the crew really but they seemed nice. This is my 3rd flight with them this year and I will continue to use them.,0
"TZ6 Singapore - Gold Coast on 777. Seats were hard felt very comfortable mid-way through the flight even though I have short legs. The reading lights kept coming on as we ""hit"" the light buttons located on the side of the arm- rest as we turned to relief body stiffness due to the discomfort of the seat. We sat 3 in a row and ordered the premium meal. I noticed mine was the biggest portion of 3. One of the portions was noticeably lesser probably about 85% of mine. There was a water point providing basic drinking water or you had the option to purchase bottled water. This is our first time flying with Scoot. Other than the uncomfortable seat overall it was OK for me and I will probably fly Scoot again. Looking forward to my return flight TZ5 on the Dreamliner. TZ5 Gold Coast - Singapore. Dreamliner seat was so much more comfortable. The soft and creative lighting makes it very pleasant. The windows shades also helps to create a soothing ambience. I like the sensor toilet flush wash basin tap and auto water drain - so much more convenient. It is sad that with such an updated and modern plane there was no drinking water point provided and basic drinking water had to be purchased. The reading light is now located on top of the arm rest and it keeps coming on as we rest our arms on the handle. Our pre-booked premium meal on this return trip was served without the Haagen Dazs ice cream. After we asked about the missing ice-cream we were given a bar of Toblerone chocolate and were informed that our meals come with Toblerone instead of Haagen Dazs. Naturally we were disappointed that we did not get what we have paid for. Will I travel with Scoot again? Yes so long as I do not need to buy basic drinking water on board and I get my meals purchased. If Scoot cannot deliver the meals purchased online they need to reconsider their model of not allowing outside food and drinks on board. There was a meal change after I booked my ticket and meal. I don't take beef. Luckily the change did not put beef on the table for me. Otherwise I will stay hungry despite having booked my meals.",0
"This is a very bad airline, they canceled my flight and did not refund me. I've wasted so much time and energy contacting them trying to get my money back, but it seems that scam customers is part of their business. Stay away from AirAsia!",1
DXB-DEL-DXB and was returning with my grandmother who was a wheelchair passenger. DXB-DEL the flight was half full and that allowed a lot of space to stretch out and sleep in comfort and while the outgoing service was excellent the return journey was par excellence. From the moment we arrived at T3 Delhi IGI our every need was met and every question answered with professionalism and friendliness. The ground handling staff member was very friendly and knowledgeable the check in staff at Delhi were very friendly and helpful and the crew of 6E21 provided service that cannot be faulted. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Indigo Airlines again.,0
DMK-DMK and DMK-KBV return on A320. Check in was quick. Flights on time. Seats comfortable and decent legspace. Crew attentive and polite. Food was decent. Luggage arrived promptly. Did miss that you could not buy a beer.,0
"Scoot Biz from Bangkok to Perth via Singapore. Scoot have new Boeing 787 aircraft now, thats an improvement over the old B777. Like all the discount airlines, you have to pay for everything even with Scoot Biz - but they go the extra mile with charges not just for baggage, meals, entertainment, they even charge you to be among the first to be boarded. At DMK no early check in available, no dedicated Scoot Biz check in lane, but I asked and was shown to a check in counter immediately. DMK-SIN Boeing 787 has only 3 rows of business class but the seats are bigger and have more recline than economy class, but were hard as concrete. As I had 11 hours waiting in SIN for the connection I decided to pay extra for lounge access, they call it scoot in style. They use the SATS lounge which is very old and tired lounge, uninterested staff, uncomfortable seats, very limited snacks - the only redeeming feature was a shower, so refreshing for the next flight was helpful. SIN-PER was another Boeing 787 but with 6 rows of business class, same hard seats. The only highlight of the trip was both meals (beef) were quite good, not usually expected with discount airlines. So much for priority baggage handling for their ScootBiz passengers, mine were among the last to come out. All hype, little substance, just another low cost airline pretending to be something better.",0
"Denpasar to Adelaide. As expected Security at Denpasar Airport took our water so we bought some more water before boarding. But that was also taken from us immediately before boarding the overnight flight to Adelaide. For unexplained reasons take off was delayed by 90 minutes. We had to wait for the trolley service before we could get water and then they made us pay $4 for a tiny bottle of the stuff (must be liquid gold). And they don't take cash only Credit Cards. On a similar flight, my elderly sister-in-law was gasping for water but her Debit Card wasn't accepted, nor was her cash, so she went without water, food and drink for the five-hour flight. This is not acceptable! It should be compulsory for all airlines to provide water as a health and safety requirement.",1
I flew from Sydney to Townsville yesterday with my husband. When we arrived at Sydney Airport we were a bit discouraged to see an extremely long queue at the Jetstar check in counter but to our surprise the queue moved very quickly and we were in line for less than 15 minutes. We checked in with no dramas and we boarded and flew out exactly on time. Once seated however I discovered that a mother and two young children aged around 4 and 6 years were seated behind me and the youngest child started to kick the back of my seat pull the tray up and down and make a fair amount of noise bickering with the other child. I put up with it until after takeoff before getting the attention of a flight attendant. I explained the situation to her quietly so as not to offend anyone and we were moved to a seat at the back of the plane immediately no questions asked. I can appreciate that it is difficult for children to sit still when flying but I was not looking forward to having my seat kicked for 2.5 hours and I was grateful that flight staff on Jetstar were able to move us quickly and without fuss. The entire flight went smoothly after that and the flight crew were very friendly and attentive throughout. I believe that we got excellent value for money for our flight and I was more than happy with the service provided.,0
"Flew Brisbane to Sydney. Worst flight attendants on my flight. Checking in and boarding was fine but the flight was terrible, I had a crying 1 year old who just cried non-stop being her ears were sore, not once did any of the 4 flight attendants come to see if she was alright. I was blocked in my seat so I couldnt stand with her and not once did any of them come to see if she was okay or if she needed anything. They would just walk past everytime. They looked miserable and so untidy, they basically looked like they had just woken up. I am so dissappointed all other airlines I have travelled offer the most amazing help and support. I will never ever travel with Jetstar again.",1
"A lot of problems before the flight (cancellations, rescheduling, etc), but finally the flight was perfect in timing, services, assistance. After buying your ticket, check your flight info periodically on the website to avoid surprises.",0
Perth to KL and 8 days later back to Perth. We were fortunate to obtain hot seats which proved to be excellent plenty of room. Coming home we changed our flight to travel with friends that left a day earlier. Changes were made efficiently but we were unable to get hot seats. Pleasantly surprised at the amount of leg room was able to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front with no effort. Didn't order food. We found staff to be pleasant efficient and I would not hesitate to book Air Asia again. The only thing I would make sure next time that I had a laptop to watch movies. Excellent flight and landed 20 minutes early.,0
"Honolulu to Sydney. I flew with Jetstar for my flight from Hawaii to Australia and then within Australia and to New Zealand. First off, with a kid and a job, a trip to Australia was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. We only had 10 days to make it to both Austalia and New Zealand, Jetstar delayed us in Hawaii for three days, our layover was supposed to be 24 hours. This meant our hotel and activities planned in Australia were just lost money for those days. We finally made it to Sydney (with only 1 day to enjoy because of the delay). From Sydney, we were flying to Melbourne and sure enough, our flight with Jetstar gets delayed, on top of that, my friend gets charged for her backpack that was well within the size restriction. We finally make it to Melbourne, after a few days there we are to fly to New Zealand. We get to the airport in Melbourne and our flight is delayed again. This was by far the most horrible and disappointing experience. I would also like to add that the flight attendants with our flights in Australia were very rude and unreasonable. I will never fly with them again.",1
"Delhi to Goa. 2.5 hour flight was delayed by over 2.5 hours and no alternative was given to take another flight instead. If they had just informed appropriately instead of informing about the delay half an hour at a time, we could have taken a different flight.",1
Singapore to Bali. What a disappointing experience. We went to automatic check in. That machine worked for only one of us. The other one had to go to the counter to check in. Later once we already passed the customs we found out about not sitting next to each other and asked for a correction. This could only be changed if we were willing to pay extra. I asked if they could put us on an earlier flight so that I would be home sooner. This was possible but we had to buy new tickets!,1
I have never flown this airline without a delay and yesterday a cancellation of my flight. Extremely poor customer service from counter staff and the offer of a bus added salt to the wound. Their service is inferior their reliability non-existent.,1
"Honolulu to Sydney via Melbourne. After our Jetstar flight was cancelled due to major engine issues we still await word on how they are getting us home. It seems Jetstar has abandoned its passengers and whats worse will not pay for our accomodation or food while we wait to be flown home. Its only after taking matters into my own hands by calling the airline and booking another flight that I'm getting out, otherwise I'm sure i would have been here a lot longer. With no money to pay for this either I had to take out an overdraw on my bank account leaving me in debt. Still awaiting some answers from this abysmal airline they call Jetstar.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. I use Thai AirAsia frequently but not the Malaysia based AirAsia. Crews as always very smart and polite. Aircraft is always clean with great seat pitch. Food can be purchased onboard although for such a short sector I never bother. My only gripe on this flight was firstly the music which was played when we boarded the plane. I always like some background music when boarding as it is relaxing and also sets a pleasant and tranquil environment but this was pop music and very loud.,0
"Worst airline ever! Delayed our first flight twice and then eventually cancelled it, stuck in Bali another night to only go through it all again the next night and then eventually getting us a flight 4 days later only to cancel that so we had to go with another airline! Absolutely useless!",1
"The personnel at Cebu Pacific Terminal 2 Departures were rude and unhelpful after overcharging me for a tax that applies to Philippine passport holders. They refused to issue a refund for the fee (around $50 USD) unless I traveled round trip 40 minutes to their terminal 1 ticketing office rather than opening the Terminal 2 ticketing booth. Luckily, I unexpectedly arrived at the airport over 2 hours early do to a lack of traffic, yet the service was still highly unprofessional. The staff seemed annoyed with me for asking for the fee to be refunded, and they were even more aggravated to help me reach the necessary desk.",1
"My husband and I had were booked on flight TZ6 which was to depart from Singapore to Coolangatta airport at 22.25pm 5/4/2015! Because my husband is in a motorised wheelchair we arrived early and paid $5pp for an early check in to avoid any hassles. The staff member at check in was extremely helpful and changed our seating from 42 H & J to 23 B & C to be closer to the exit and toilets. On our arrival to the departure lounge we were approached by an employee with a manual wheelchair and he told my husband to get in it! We explained several times to him that the wheelchair was unsuitable and that a smaller chair was necessary to get him on the plane. We finally got on board the plane and they took the small wheelchair off the plane! I asked ""How will my husband get to the toilet if there's no wheelchair on board the plane?"". The fellow from the departure gate got into an argument with the stewardess and we understood that he was telling her that she and the other stewardesses would have to carry him to the toilet which was approximately 20ft (6metres) away! My husband told the fellow that he was too heavy for them to carry him! Eventually other male passengers agreed to carry him. A few minutes later the staff member demanded I disconnect the battery on the wheelchair! I told him several times that it was disconnected. By this time both my husband and I and were getting very upset. A few minutes later the departure lounge man came back and said ""Good news the wheelchair is on board because it's a dry cell battery"". He had kept the plane from departing for almost an hour we finally flew out at 23.10pm! Because of him  this experience has made us realise that although the stewardesses were extremely polite and helpful Scoot is not worth travelling on!",1
We flew Jetstar from Brisbane to Hobart on the 12th of August 2019 and returned the 15th of August. I had a wheelchair and Jetstar was absolutely amazing with their customer service with checking in at BNE airport. We (my mother and I) were checked in through the fast track lane and where given one of Jetstars wheelchairs to use. Very impressed. We then were boarded first and upgraded to the Seats with more legroom for free. Which was a nice surprise (we were upgraded on the return flight too). They had the lift to the aircraft waiting for us. Return flight was the same. Absolutely impressed considering this is a budget airline.,0
"Dunedin to Auckland by JQ284 on 7th March. There was no self check-in in Dunedin Airport, but checked-in was fast in the Jetstar's counter. My Seat was 11B. The space of the seat was not enough,so I felt uncomfortable. The service of cabin crew was just at the standard level. But this flight was value for the price.",0
"It was a pleasant flying experience with Airasia from Kota Kinabalu to Hangzhou. This was my 4th trip flying with Airasia on this sector. Hangzhou (HGH) is the furthest destination served by Airasia from Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Flight departed slightly behind schedule, the captain made an apology on the delay before the aircraft taxied off. Cabin crew were Sabah based crew. Inflight meal was served soon after the seat belt sign is off and passengers with pre-booked meal are on the priority. Majority of the passengers are originated from mainland China. Cabin crew are patient to answer and assist passengers despite the language barrier. I am impressed with the hospitality and service. The return flight departed on time and a big thank you for the crew on board. Overall flying experience with Airasia is pleasant though there are still room for improvement. I suggest Airasia recruit Chinese speaking crew for flight departing China.",0
I undertook 6 flights on Cebu Pacific in February 2015. On 5 out of the 6 flights were delayed and the common excuse was traffic issues at Manila. This while other airlines plying the same route were leaving on time without any delays. Cebu Pacific announce proudly on their website when you book that they have a 69.1% punctuality rate for February! Onboard seating is comfortable and service is good though I do wish they would stop playing those silly games which can be annoying if trying to sleep on a night flight. There doesn't seem to be a consistent set of rules regarding use of ipads during flight. Some of the flights it was announced that it was ok to use ipads/ tablets if in flight mode throughout the flight from pushback to landing. On other flights they weren't allowed to be used till at cruising altitude. Since Cebu Pacific took over Tiger Air for domestic flights in the Philippines there now is really only Cebu Pacific of Philippine Airlines and as a result a number of routes have been cut completely and fares increased significantly. Cebu Pacific announced no more fuel surcharges however the price of flights increased so customers pay the same or more. When booking online beware of the add on's such as insurance / seat selection etc which are automatically added and must be removed by passenger if not wanted. Overall Cebu Pacific have good modern aircraft and provide a decent service just allow extra time (3 hours) for delays which almost always occur.,0
My first experience with AirAsia from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was a splendid and enjoyable one. The flight departed on time and had a soft touchdown at Kuala Lumpur. It was an enjoyable flight as I admired the views outside and took photos of the great view the seat has to offer. I will choose Air Asia if I have to fly short haul again.,0
"Phuket to Penang and the flight from Phuket to KL was fine. Get to connecting gate on time and there's no staff there to unlock the waiting area so people are sitting in the corridor on the floor waiting 20 minutes for staff to show up. Staff finally show up and the wait begins. People are expecting to board but we wait. After about 15 minutes I walk up to the gate desk and confirm that the flight is delayed. About ten minutes after this, someone at the desk gets the bright idea of actually proactively communicating this info to the rest of the passengers over the PA. We are given a boarding time of 7:25PM.  I leave and come back at 7:20 and we're still not boarding 10 minutes later. I ask again if the flight is going to be further delayed and I am told that 7:45 is the new time. I began to watch the customer service performance of the lady working the desk and I become amazed at how much basic training in customer service the staff are lacking. She gives no information until people come up and ask what time the flight is leaving. People wouldn't have been getting upset had they just had this basic info communicated to them. This way, people can make arrangements for their pickups from the airport, arrange a late check in etc. Pretty basic stuff. All told, this lady allowed 12 people to get so ticked off that they came up and angrily asked what was going on. She gave them all the same reply she gave to me, but it blew my mind that she never once picked up the PA and told everyone. She wasn't doing anything else really. All told the plane landed in Penang an hour late - not a huge deal but the manner in which this delay was handled was amateur.",1
"Melbourne (MEL) to Coolangatta (OOL). Jetstar is probably one of the best cheap airlines in Australia. They have friendly staff, decent seats with generous leg-room and meals/beverages that are nice but not excessively priced. I have flown Jetstar numerous times and have never let me down!",0
"I have not had a worse flight run than my two most recent flights with Jetstar. Firstly the over 10 hour international flight with no food provided or inflight entertainment provided. Then after arriving at the connecting airport with less than 2 hours to my next flight. The flight was suddenly cancelled leaving me with no option but to wait in an hour long line to get my flight moved. I was lucky and able to get on a flight later in the evening however some people were told they couldnt get on until the next day. Further to this, the flight I was moved to then was delayed by 40 min and then after arriving at my destination we waited for over 40 min in the aircraft as we were unable to disembark. One of the worst experiences I have had flying. I will not be flying with Jetstar again.",1
"Davao to Cebu. Arrived about 2 hours early for my flight. But the flight was delayed for about 1 hour. When we were at the gate, ground staff were handing out free GetGo membership cards. GetGo is the loyalty program of Cebu Pacific. Boarding commenced, the seat was quiet clean and modern, but one of the tray table's arms were damaged, so it wouldn't stay put. Tried out a Kalamansi Muffin, which was a decent snack for the 1 hour flight. There was abit of turbulence but I could handle it. Cabin crew were very generous and friendly. Overall, great airline and would love to fly with them again!",0
Delhi to Mumbai on Dec 31st. I had a good experience flying Indigo. We left on time plane was new and clean and service was good. Only comment is that FAs should smile a little more but besides that I was quite impressed by the service and would definitely use them again.,0
"If you are looking for a cheap easy flight look elsewhere. Cebu lists low rates to get you started on purchasing a ticket by listing a super low price. By the time you're finished making the reservation it might be quite a bit more and by the time they finish ""nickle-and-diming"" you for all the ""extras"" you will have paid more for the flight. In my case I got a round trip ticket from Japan to Manila for what I thought would only be about $300 USD. By the time I finished checking in for my return flight I will have spent more than $700 USD in total. For an international flight that provided no food or water without extra payment. Everything about the flight is cheap. There are no movies no pillows no blankets if buy food on the flight they hand you a hot aluminium case of food (street vendor style) without a tray like other airlines do which makes it all to easy for things to drop away under other seats. In my case I only had so many Philippine Pesos left so I could only afford a dish to eat but couldn't get any water or anything at all to drink. Take my advice if you want a well priced flight that has transparent policies provides food and water during long international flights has movies to watch provides comfort in the cabin (with bedding and providing liquids to drink) choose another airline: for example ANA Singapore Air JAL United. I've travelled to over 30 countries. Cebu was one of the more expensive flights I've taken (final price) and the value for money was the absolute worst.",1
"Bengaluru to Kolkata. On this early morning flight, I had arrived at the airport much ahead of schedule and despite that, I still managed to check in and print the boarding pass selecting my seat which saves on the money if one were to check online. Baggage drop was easily done and the agent at the desk was with a pleasant demeanor. Boarding started ahead if schedule on this flight and was warmly greeted by the flight attendants. As it was during the Christmas time, the background music was related to the holidays which was a nice touch. Departure was on time and the rest of the flight passed off uneventfully. Arrival was on time and was able to collect my baggage as well. Only thing I observed was that the key chain of my bag was missing even though the contents of the bag appear to be intact. And I am not sure if the airline or any of the baggage handlers might be responsible for the loss of the keychain. But it could quite easily have resulted in the loss of any other items so I am not sure. This aspect has the only negative over what was by and large a flawless flight.",0
"Good budget airline. 15 kg check in and 7 kg cabin baggage included. On time departure and early arrival. Clean cabin, seat itch just as any LCC. Courteous cabin crew:",0
"We just had our flight cancelled without a proper reason. And then told we had to overnight in Cairns. But had to find our own accommodation and transport from the airport. We were offered $300 for the night but minimum cost in Cairns is $350. So we have to pay the rest ourselves. We may or may not get the cost of transport to and from the airport, for a possible flight the next day. This is a dodgy airline. Do not use them in any circumstances. Performance is atrocious and customer service is non existent.",1
"I enjoyed the flight. Check in was quite easy, although terminal 4 at Melbourne is not particularly good as it's a long journey to the departure gates and little room to sit down. Passengers must check that their on board baggage is the correct weight and size as it will be checked. Sometimes it is more convenient to purchase the extra baggage. The departure was quite punctual and it's worthwhile purchasing the meals on the website if you want something more substantial The staff were very pleasant and helpful.",0
CGK to KUL return. Didn't expect much as had poor experiences with Lion in the past but was pleasantly surprised. Check-in very orderly both flights arrived absolutely on time and the fare was very competitive indeed. No food or IFE. Everything else was no-frills - but seats are allocated and flight operates to the proper passenger terminal at KUL and not the awful LCCT so I'd say that Lion has the edge over the other low-cost operator on this route Air Asia.,1
"After reading negative reviews about Scoot, I am very surprised as we had such a wonderful trip with them flying from Singapore to Gold Coast. The food was great, the service exemplary, and the trip both comfortable and safe. I actually had a wee dizzy spell (I am a diabetic) and the staff were incredibly attentive, showing both professional and personal care. I think there are no complaints by the people who travel a lot. They know the ins and outs of low cost carriers, ie the no bringing food aboard etc, as this is pretty commonplace worldwide. I found the food and chance to buy more if we wanted was excellent and not expensive. I found the TV/movie choices to be great, and they show them the new way most airlines are doing so now on your own device. I loved the fact I could use wifi onboard. All in all, I give Scoot top marks, and we will be flying with them again if ever out that way.",0
"Cairns to Gold Coast. Brilliant service! First time flying with Jetstar and had first class service at Gold Coast airport, with staff noticing I needed help and walked me through the very simple check-in process - things have changed since I last travelled! Online service just as professional, both to Cairns and return to GC. Friendly, helpful and professional. Flights left on time and arrived on time (even early in Gold Coast). Bags were there for collection within minutes of landing. I even received texts when boarding gate/s became open. I'm wanting to return one day soon to the Great Barrier Reef and I will definitely fly Jetstar again.",0
Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.,1
"When I first flew Scoot a few years ago, the ""premium"" class was called Scoot Biz although it was really just a premium economy product. It was an excellent alternative to flying normal economy class being good value, good service with the comfort of a smaller cabin, bigger seats and priority check-in etc. The premium cabin has been renamed Scoot Plus some time ago but product remained the same. However, things appear to have changed. The cabin on this flight was dirty, the crew disinterested, the ""one"" complimentary drink served with the meal can no longer be a choice including wine/beer as you can only buy this as apparently the policy has changed and only water, soft drink, tea or coffee can be chose. I was informed I could only buy a wine when the Scoot Cafe opens. The meals were served immediately the flight reached cruising altitude and were being collected before I had even started. The lights were dimmed during the meal service and the crew disappeared. Other passengers started ringing the bell to order from the Scoot Cafe as it seems no trolley was going to appear. I thought selling food and drinks was the way to make money on these budget airlines! The crew freely allowed passengers from the back of the plane to use the one and only lavatory in the front of the premium cabin. I paid a lot of money for this flight for me, my wife and daughter (being the end of the school holidays in Australia) and was extremely disappointed in the standard of pretty much everything on this and another recent Scoot flight.",1
Surabaya Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. It was a very early flight (5 am). The flight was nearly full as many groups of people performing Umrah were using this service en-route to Jeddah. This contributed to the delay of the flight departure to about 30 minutes. The first food service for pre-booked meals and second for in-flight food sales was done rather quickly but smoothly. The first officer made the pre-departure announcement while the captain made the mid-air announcement. The flight was generally smooth all the way. Landing was good.,0
Ahmedabad to Bengaluru. The flight was delayed by an hour with no announcements to indicate the reason. Bad time management and customer service. Spicejet is much better and would recommend it over Indigo any day.,1
"Ho Chi Minh City to Penang. This was a very straightforward flight experience with an easy check, boarding, flight and landing. As it's a budget airline you don't expect any frills but the experience was fine all the way through. We'd paid extra so we got express boarding (more so we can be sure to get overhead luggage space beside our seats). No complaints at all. Good value for money.",0
"Sydney to Cairns. I was literally 1 min away from cut off and the computer couldnt find me, I then went to the customer service desk which in turn delayed me by about 2 mins. I then got told I was 2 mins late to check in and would have to buy another ticket. I cannot put into words how poor the service is .. especially when the staff told Me to go to 2 different places before then saying I was late Arriving 31 mins before departure.",1
"Delhi to Hyderabad. Highly appreciate the customer-centric service of IndiGo. I was coming from the USA to Hyderabad with an intermediate connection through IndiGo in Delhi. My check-in luggage was close to 45 kgs (with an excess of 30 kgs). However, under normal baggage policy terms, the excess amount was coming out to be 30x400 = 12000 INR. Because of two ground staff intervention, they helped me realize the facility of International customers and their luggage benefits. Went the extra mile to confirm the price with the technical service team and made me pay 7800 INR, instead of 12K. I really appreciate these two staff members professionalism in taking 40 min extra time to help me and support me through out the check in process. Thanks to these two staff members for your Customer Centric service in the middle of the night for a jet-lagged customer like me. Well done IndiGo for maintaining such enthusiastic employees.",0
Have used Lion Air several times on domestic flights. It's a budget airline so cheap prices. Facilities as you'd might expect are quite standard for low cost carrier: no onboard complimentary meals no IFE cramped seat pitch (unless for several seats along the emergency exits) narrow aisles and needless to say chaotic upon boarding and unboarding as it is often full. Flight itself sometimes experiences delays but usually departs and arrives on time. FAs in general are quite friendly. If you have a rather limited budget this airline is worth considering for travel among Indonesian cities.,0
Manila to Legazpi. Cancelled my flight due this pandemic. Opted put the money to my travel fund that didn't take me more than 2 minutes to do. Validity is for one year. Good job Cebu Pacific,0
BLR-DEL return trip. Had a good experience yet again. The flights took had a timely pushback. Onward journey a bit delayed due to bad weather at BLR and the pilot had to change the takeoff runaway direction. Crew courteous and got my pre booked food. Return journey was uneventful as well. Will surely continue flying Indigo.,0
My 70 year old mother flew Jetstar from Hobart to Melbourne and was targeted to weigh her baggage (very small suitcase + handbag) and when it was just over the 10kg limit was told to pay the $70 or leave things behind! No empathy no consideration blunt and rude. Whilst it is ridiculous that you have to weigh both your suitcase and handbag the exorbitant fee and accompanying rude treatment is even worse. The cost for baggage is $10 if you pay prior and $70 if they target you on the day. How they can justify charging 7 times the standard fee? I will never book anyone on Jetstar ever again. Fly at your peril.,1
JQ58 DPS-BNE. Red-eye flight which was delayed by an hour departing 0035. This was our first flight with Jetstar in business class but paid for with QFF points (classic award). This apparently meant no entitlement to lounge access at Denpasar as ticket class was insufficient +/- we hadn't requested lounge access? (Had no idea we were meant to). This was an unhappy start to the flight as we'd been hanging out for a shower after a long day in Bali. Initial impression favourable staff friendly. Drinks offered and delivered promptly food order taken. Downhill from there. Partner's meal failed to materialise - seemed like everyone was getting meals in dribs and drabs (low staffing numbers?) so we kept waiting. Gave up when we realised staff had disappeared and cabin was asleep for the night. (Yes could have followed up but we were dead on our feet and preferred to sleep). The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes. No pillow only blow up neck rest in comfort packs. Entertainment system (screen in armrest) and headphones ok but choices limited compared to other airlines. Wouldn't use them again but options limited from DPS to Australia. Compared to Qantas very poor indeed.,1
"Perth to Bali. When booking my flight to Bali the Jetstar web site allocated seats to me which I did not change or select. Then when I printed out my invoice notice a seat selection fee. When I complained to Jetstar live chat agent, he said I should have unchecked the allocated seats so to avoid the fee. I think this is a terrible design and one could say made to trick customers in my view. Jetstar said my mistake was refundable and would do nothing to help. There is very little choice between AirAsia and Jetstar but one who likes to use local Jetstar was my choice. Well not anymore.",1
"Sydney to Singapore with Scoot. Check in process running well, good ground staff handling. This flight delayed 30 minutes in departure, but on time in arrival. Passenger seat occupancy maybe less than 1/3 of capacity. No problem with limited Legroom, because passenger can occupying 3 seats or more. I order chicken noodle 5 SGD and heaven and earth tea 4 SGD, accept banknotes or credit card. Okay for flying 8 hours. Friendly flight attendant. Arrival at Changi airport transfer using only 2 buses. It is really low cost carrier.",0
"I flew from Cengkareng Airport in Jakarta to Changi in Singapore. There are too many bad things flying with this airline. I paid about $250 for a two-way ticket Jakarta to Singapore. At the website, I had to pay an additional $30 for check-in baggage. When I checked-in, the female staff were rude. No greetings and pretending to be busy like I was invisible. And them the flight was late. Scheduled to depart at 11.20 am. At 12.30 pm the plane was still on the runway waiting for take off. As a result, the flight was late about an hour arriving in Singapore. I had a meeting at 4 pm on the same day and I was late and it was embarrassing because they thought I was not punctual. When in fact, it was caused by Air Asia. And then, when returning home, the staff in Singapore were rather mute. They just saw us, say nothing and kept working. Hello? Are you human or robot? Can you talk? Wow? They call Air Asia a company? Even a 1 star hotel in Singapore does a better service. I would say improve the service or good luck in the future.",1
Mumbai to Raipur. The fare for extra luggage is too high. No food is provided during travelling. I dont think its worth paying 6000 for each flight and not getting any facilities.  Please improve your service.,1
They are slowly getting their act together. Food not the best but not overly expensive for what you get. No entertainment inflight - suggest you take some but on night flight return really not needed. I paid extra for leg room 31k not the best and by the toilets - not worth the extra. The next 2 rows back would be my pick next time. Will there be a next time yes I would fly Scoot again.,0
Newcastle to Brisbane. Jetstar I call them latestar. Regularly delayed and will put a flight to the same destination in front of your flight so only one will be delayed. Very poor.,1
"Sydney to Gold Coast. Jetstar never again. They left us in the rain, no umbrella, no nothing lining up and cause I tried staying under a sheltered area (the exit where we came out from ) for as long as all the back seats passengers got in, a hostess yelled at me and other passengers, then told me I had to bring my own umbrella as they don't provide it. Then she said it's not my fault. So we all got wet and cold thanks, and they wouldnt even give us a blanket on board, just some paper towels. There were two entrances, they could have let us all in from the front one which was covered but they didnt. They didnt provide an umbrella and they didnt help.",1
I've flown Jetstar many times and over the last half dozen flights have opted for business class seats. On 11th June we returned from Phuket to Sydney once again in business class. I have to say the food provided on this flight was very disappointing. Very little difference to what companions were given in economy class. Bland tasteless muck. We did have metal cutlery! Once the meal was served the attendants seamed to disappear and even getting a fresh bottled water was a chore. I'm not convinced the extra cost over economy is actually good value. The seats are comfortable if you're above average height and you do get off the flight first upon arrival making it quicker at immigration. overall though I think they need to lift their game. In their favour I did think the food quality was better on the Sydney to Thailand leg maybe they need to look at the suppliers in Thailand?,1
"Bangkok to Gold Coast via Singapore on 29 January. The first flight from Bangkok to Singapore was all right, I had a stopover around 4 hours in Singapore to take my second flight. The plane took off at 10.40 pm (Singapore local time), and was supposed to arrived at 8:10 am on the 30 of January. But, after 2h30 the pilot inform us he decided to turn back to Singapore, because of a small crack in the window. We didnt receive more information. We couldnt reach the wifi to contact our friends and family to explain them the situation. After 2h30 we arrived in Singapore again. We had to wait 2 hours in the airport in the middle of the night (4:45am to 6:45am, Singapore hours), all tired, stress, and angry. For all of this inconvenience we received a small bag with snacks and a small bottle of water, so not even a proper meal. We finally arrive at Gold Coast airport at 2:10pm (Singapore hours) instead of 8:10am. So with a delay of more than 7 hours and with all of the inconvenience I suffered, I reclaimed them a refund of my flight but they just answered me ""that's not our politic, but we will provide you a 50$ voucher"". I Spent in total 16 hours on a plane and 22 hours at airports, for a one way ticket I paid 715AUD$, and I get a 50$ voucher, Its scandalous! So I you're hesitate with different company for your next flight, think about it twice before choosing the cheapest one or the easy one, check all of the review on internet and you'll see I am not the only one who had such a awful experience with them.",1
"Zipair has the worst customer service. The check in employees at Narita airport are rude and unprofessional. When you try to contact them via phone, they tell you that communication is via email only. When you email customer service and you question them or disagree with anything, they will ghost you. I do not recommend this company.",1
"Manila to Cebu with AirAsia. Worst airline and customer service that I have ever experienced. Yes, they are low cost but they dont care about the people that book their flights. They dont provide any support if you need to modify your flights and only give AVA as a form of support. Shes a bot and when she cant help, she doesnt provide any helpful contact information to get a hold of someone who can help. Please boycott this airline. They dont care about anything but the money.",1
Singapore to Melbourne mid April. Check in immigration and security were quick and efficient. Friendly welcome aboard from the flight crew with the offer of drinks prior to push back. Take off was on time hot towels were offered and the food was quite acceptable with beverages offered. Entertainment was on ipads and more than adequate for a 7-1/2 hour flight. The seat was adequate with sufficient leg room but was by no means what one would expect from a quality airline. Nevertheless I managed a few hours sleep. All up a surprisingly pleasant flight with an early arrival into Melbourne and very good value for the price paid.,0
"Hobart to Perth via Melbourne. I have flown Jetstar a few times and only once had a good experience this flight was the worst making a last minute quick trip to Perth. Had carry on only as I have a handbag/laptop bag and small suitcase at gate I stupidly weighed suitcase again, it was 1 kg over, I again stupidly honest let the girls know, I thought I could just transfer something to handbag. This honesty cost me $60 and a further $32 at Melbourne for next leg. When calling to complain I may as well have been told learn to be dishonest like a lot of others have learned to be or don't fly with Jetstar. I will be choosing to fly virgin from now on and will not recommend to anyone. virgin have luggage auto included and a snack or meal on plane depending on flight time and free in flight entertainment. Jetstar has none of these so if you work out the charges for these extras supplied free from virgin, it works out virgin is a lot cheaper and the staff are amazing.",1
Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8320 23 Mar 2014 CGK-DMK (A320). Website check-in is convenient CGK check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in CGK is utter chaos and staff are in Go away Go away mode. Again Crew welcoming and point to your seat (the Weekend uniform is extremely untidy it kills the image). Announcements again so fast. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food again looks like it has been recycled 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Satay with Asian Fried rice). Again no information that it contained Shrimp paste (I'm allergic to Seafood). On landing the announcements were so fast. Overall I will fly them again but as I said in my previous comment will bring my own food and water.,0
"The worst experience. I will never fly with this airline again. Very not recommended. My family of 9 went from Sydney to Melbourne (2 ways with same airline). Our flight from Syd to Melb was actually good. We flew with kid (not infant, 2 yo paid ticket) and we brought a foldable cabin size pram with no bag, so it couldn't go into the cabin and must be given to the staff at the gate, free of charge. Which is common on most airlines. The ground staffs in Sydney were friendly. But the flight back from Melbourne to Sydney was a nightmare. The flight delayed for hours, after our original flight was canceled a day before. We were not allowed to check the pram in at the gate. The ground staffs weighed all of our carry-on luggages at the gate, including the pram. So the pram was counted and it caused us to exceed the cabin weight limit. We complained because the pram was not an issue on our previous flight. It's weird and unreasonable because how come the rules in Sydney and Melb are different. But the staff did not accept the complaint and gave us 2 non-negotiable options. 1. Pay the extra charge (double from the normal price) or 2. If we are not willing to pay the charge, they will move us to the next flight for us to checked in the pram but it will cost us more money. We often travel with kids and never have a disappointing experience like this. It was obvious they want to upsell us so bad. We feel scammed. Some staff were rude and arrogant. The way they talked to us from the beginning was disrespectful and intimidating. And one of them kept complaining about our not-so-loud kids. I mean, what did you expect from kids who are bored to tears because they have been waiting for your delayed flight too long. Unbelievably poor customer service. What a shame.",1
"It was my first time flying with Air Asia. We flew from Hong Kong to Manila with my family and friends. The flight itself was fine. Some of our hand carry luggage exceeded the weight limit. The lady who checked our luggage scolded us even I told her already that we will check in the excess weight. We opened our luggage so we can take out valuable items and when she saw us doing that she said, I will give you 10 mins to finish that otherwise you cannot board the aircraft.",1
"Darwin to Sydney. Jetstar does not have self service kiosks in operation at Darwin Airport, however online check in is available up to 1 hr before departure. Check in for domestic flights opens 2 hrs prior to departure and closes 30 mins prior to departure. The flight boarded about 15 mins prior to departure, there were a few unoccupied seats towards the rear of the aircraft and some passengers managed to get three seats to themselves. Prior to take off the captain gave a quick description of the route and the expected weather in Sydney. A quick food and beverage service was offered just after take off, the cabin lights were dimmed shortly after the service finished. The flying time to Sydney was 3 hrs 55 mins.The flight was smooth and most people managed to get some sleep. The flight went into a holding pattern just North of Sydney to wait for the 6am curfew to be lifted at Sydney Airport.",0
"Brisbane to Sydney. I felt I am been ripped off by Jetstar this morning. I have been taking my daily trip with a carry bag for more than 10 years. First time this morning Jetstar decides to weight my carry bag this morning. The weight was 7.1 kg + 1 kg for my iPad. Then the staff decide it is more than 7kg and charged me 60 dollars. I said I could just wear another jeans from the bad and they could consider. The answer was no. I said iPad I can carry on my hand, they said that is part of the carry bag. Holly shit, is this how they start doing business and look after their customers. Guys, be careful, the cheap price is not real anymore. Worst experience ever.",1
Booked a return flight from Bangkok to Krabi with my wife. She was 27 weeks pregnant and we confirmed with Air Asia before flying that nothing special was required. We flew to Krabi and all was perfect. On the way back we were seated onboard for 5 minutes when a crew member asked us to leave the plane as we did not have any authorization to fly. We were left at 8.30pm in the empty airport with no solution for us to go back home. Luckily we could take a Thai Airways flight home.,1
Jakarta to Penang. Cheap flight without free baggage and free meals. Worth it and value for money pricing for flight. Must book long long time before flight to get cheap price of the flight.,0
"Our trip to Athens this month certainly met our expectations. Scoot is a budget airline though you wouldn't know it from the attentive ground crew and the cabin crew we had on our flights from Perth to Athens. The best way to enjoy such a long flight (11.5 hours) is what we did by paying that bit extra and having extra leg room seat or/ exit row. It's totally worth it as there is no reclining seat in front of you and the access to get out of the seat makes the journey so much more comfortable. The only negative was the very worn carpet, unusual as it was a fairly new Boeing 787. The plane left on time in both Perth/Singapore and Athens. We will definitely travel Scoot again.",0
"Excellent Customer service. The whole Refund process of 3 flights, took hours instead of days. Initially I didn't get the otp, while trying to cancel the flights via their website, but it was faster/smoother via their app. A Customer service representative kindly called me for my initial complaint about the otp. Excellent experience overall.",0
"Bali to Singapore. After take off I laid back my seat, right away a girl behind me starting kicking my seat and after a while I asked her if she had a problem with it, she said she didnt have space for her legs. I said it was not my problem and told her to stop and call crew. I turn around and she pushes again. I called the crew member and explained the situation, he said he couldnt do anything so he just told her to stop. She stopped for about 20 min and kept going, she pushed so strong that she even made the seat go back to the normal way only by kicking it. I called again and the lady said Im sorry theres nothing I can do and I didnt see her (the girl was admitting what she had done) and then told the girl I understand you dont have space Im so sorry, Im gonna see If we have a bigger seat for you. She didnt want to change so the lady just told me Im sorry its only 40 min left please just try to hold on. The lady just said she couldnt do anything while the girl kept laughing with their friends. At the end a cabin crew guy understood me, said it was my right to have the seat how I wanted to and offered to change me and my friend. The girl just got away with it and nothing was said to her. Also no food or drinks were offered free in a 2.5 hr flight.",1
"Singapore to Taipei. My flight was at 6:10am in the morning, I only managed to reach airport at 5:10am because the taxi driver lost his way. I tried check in using the machine but was not successful so proceed to counter, by the time I reach counter already 5:20am, the staff at the counter said the gate already closed and because I didnt do online check in so she cant let me in asked me to proceed to another counter to reschedule the timing. I then proceed to another counter paid $220 for reschedule the flight. I dont understand if she can let those have done online check in people go in at that time why cant she let me in for my case.",1
"Sydney to Honolulu. Low fare carrier was the true and honest name they choose for themselves, the carrier truly upholds the word ""Low"" and apply it to all aspects of the experience. Choosing the seats, you pay to choose the seat fair enough, however how can you assign a six year old a seat 3 rows away from her parents?? we were all allocated seats in row 50E,F,G,H and J but my six year old child was in 53B. when I spoke to the officer checking us in he said ""it is done and that is that"" and refused to talk to us! When we boarded we were strictly instructed to take our assigned seats until take off, so my daughter would sit by herself during take off,  mind you she was in the middle seat between 2 strangers. after the doors closed i noticed 4 vacant seats at the back of the plane, so i went to the crew member and asked if i can move to these seats, ""NO"" was the answer, when i asked why, they said because these seats are allocated for the crew to rest during the flights. They could see my daughter in distress, but their seats were far more important than the feelings of a six year old. I tried to make a complaint, and the process is a lot of fun not. They get you to chat to someone and these people are more robot like than humans, they were only trained to use the right language and legal terms that would not get the airlines in trouble but have no EQ what so ever. Finally i was offered 50 dollars voucher and a further 25 dollars for each of us  ""this is not a compensation but it is a good will gesture for your experience"" that was repeated more than 6 times in the chat. They refused to give me a case number so i do not complain to the ACA. This was actually coming on the back of another ""wonderful experience"" with Jetstar, on the way there they lost my luggage. Ii contacted them and was given a case number, six days later i have not heard from them, i went to the airport in a desperate attempt to find my luggage, i went to the office asked them and they said, ""yes it has been sitting here for 6 days"" I asked why has no one contacted me? no answer? but as soon as i got back to the hotel, I found an email telling me that my luggage, which i had just picked up was found and ready for collection.",1
"The staff of the ground office was terrible. They did not help us and only made it so difficult, it took so long in the line that we almost missed our airplane. I never experienced such a bad airplane service. You have to pay for everything and no service at all.",1
"Ho Chi Minh City to Manila with Cebu Pacific. As the reviews say avoid at all cost. There's something about the Philippines and their welfare flight delays. Flight for was suppose to leave at 1:10am, April 28. Got pushed back to 2:45am. Don't know if we'll make our connecting flight to Princessa.",1
Denpasar to Surabaya. I have been reading a lot of negative reviews but I booked my flight 2 days prior to flying. It was the cheapest option as budget airlines should be. On the day of the flight the flight was 2 hours delayed. They gave every passenger a meal for the inconvenience and then kept apologizing which I think went above and beyond. Would recommend Lion Air to anyone.,0
"Ho Chi Minh city to Sydney. First of all the price is really cheap when comparing to the other airline and because of the cheap price of course the services are not good. The price it showed only the ticket price, not include any other services. You have to pay more for baggage, food or only a blanket and entertainment option. A 8 hours flight with no food, cold but no blanket, bored but cant watch any show. And the seat, super uncomfortable, I dont know why or just my seat but I cant pull down the seat so I cant sleep at all. Obviously this is the worst flight ever.",1
"Chennai to Hyderabad and Hyderabad to Bangalore in February. Very pleased with this airline, clean aircraft, on time service, no luggage issues. I booked this trip from the US and everything worked out without any issues. Excellent value for money and way better than full service airlines I have flown within India.",0
"Was suppose to fly out on a flight from Sydney to Melbourne on Friday  6th December at 8:30pm as it got delayed 3 times due to the smoke coming from the New south Wales bush fires before it was announced cancelled at 11pm. At this stage, I was frustrated an I had called the Jetstar contact center and had explained the situation on which they had re booked me for a flight to Melbourne the next morning with Virgin which I thought was good service. I also had been told that I would be reimbursed for a hotel up to $150 dollars per night from the lady I was on the phone as I and didn't want to take a cab or ride share that would easily cost me over $100 to get back home to go back to my area which is 35kms away from the Airport. I decided to sleep at a hotel nearby which costed me $180 on which I thought I would get reimbursed with $30 for food reimbursements as well but I ended up with nothing as I had to live in a area 50 km away from the airport. If I was told by anyone by Jetstar this whole situation of me forking out more money would of been avoided. Jetstar really needs to improve their communication as it is really just poor and wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with them.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. Absolute disgrace. Flight cancelled 40 minutes before departure with no reasoning other than engineering issue. No replacement flight provided until 8:40 pm the following night. When finally spoke to someone, they refused to compensate any costs travelling to and from the airport, or the $400 loss of hotel accommodation in Melbourne. Will never fly with this airline again.",1
Checked in the night before it simply said schedule changed and please call this number. Found out they had moved me onto the morning flight which was less than 12 hrs later. Now what would happen to people who do not online check-in I hate to fathom. I received no email or text regarding this change. Arrived at the airport the next morning and explained that I had a whole day planned in Yogyharata and because of this flight change I also would now have a 14 hr transit (instead of 2) in Denpasar. I was reasonable and asked for use of a lounge in Denpasar to wait it out. The counter staff explained that there was nothing else they could do because they do not have a lounge in Denpasar. I simply left it and will do any further talking with my feet.,1
Sydney to Ballina/Byron with Jetstar Airways. Check-in at Sydney was very slow. Arrived 1.5 hrs before flight still needed to hurry to gate. Only two check in counters open. Flight was excellent value - flight arrived ahead of schedule. Great crew - clean aircraft. Probably would have given it a 10 if it wasn't for the check in experience.,0
"Taking this budget airline was not easy especially when you are seated right at the back of Boeing 777. The cabin crew were quite friendly but the fact that many of them were new they could only answer questions and complaints with ""I'm not very sure"" ""I'll check for you"" and ""sorry"". And it took them to serve food 2 hours after takeoff in which case many passengers at the back were starving. Then it took another 1 hour to serve the drinks and expect the leftovers of what the passengers in the front seats to be served to you. And it was difficult to hear what the stewardesses were announcing to us.",1
"Pontianak to Jakarta on board Boeing 737-800 NG. The check in process is smooth and the ground staff was kind and helpful. The cabin crew was nice and polite. This point makes me amazed that The flight was really on time for departure and arrival to Jakarta. Overall, it is good journey with Lion Air and I recommended.",0
"I'm shocked and disappointed! I paid in advance on the 20th of January, and according to the bank, the payment has been successful so far. I received all the proper notifications about my upcoming flights daily. However, when I arrived at the airport, the airline informed me that there are issues with my payment and I need to purchase another ticket, which, of course, costs more. When I called my bank, they confirmed once again that my payment was indeed successful. The airline suggested that I buy another ticket now and request a refund later when I return. I am extremely frustrated for several reasons: - The airline provided incorrect information by sending me letters assuring that everything was okay, but it turned out not to be the case at the airport. The payment I made was successful, as confirmed by the bank. Why didn't the airline refund the money if the payment wasn't successful? Why should I pay more for another ticket when I already paid for the same booking? Now, in order to get a refund, I have to spend my time going to the office because they don't recognize the double payment online.",1
I am a Macau SAR passenger who had purchased Scoot ticket flying from Taipei to Sapporo. Due to Coronavirus  situation in our Country  we were banned to travel to Taiwan by Taiwan Government. We were unable to take Scoot flight to CTS. We requested refund / defer our tickets due to this uncontrollable situation but after several emails we were being informed Scoot will not provide any assistance to this situation. Other Airlines (Air Macau MFM-TPE & Jetstar CTS-NRT ) had accepted our refund request and would process shortly.,1
KUL-MEL-KUL and KUL-LGW. The cabin is clean and modern the staff friendly attentive and do an excellent job. Food was ok - reasonably priced and sufficient. The toilets were reasonably clean even on long flight to London from KUL. All flights on time. Generally very happy with the service shame they've stopped flying to the UK! If flying long haul make sure you take some entertainment.,0
"I flew with AirAsia twice this month, 1st from Penang to Langkawi, and then from Langkawi to Kuala Lampur, and both were top quality flights. The 1st flight arrived at the destination even earlier than the stated time, and the 2nd one was punctual as well, their cabin crew are all professional, well dressed, respectful and beautiful too! unlike Malaysian Airlines staff which were disrespectful and not good looking, If you're looking for domestic flights within Malaysia, they're the best option to choose imo, don't let the negative reviews scare you away, I bought one 25kg luggage and when I weighed it at the airport, it was 2 kg above that but still they said it was fine and didn't charge anything extra for it.",0
"Singapore to Jakarta. The people at the check in counter made it very difficult to check in our baggage. They were very rude and impatient. While we check in, the next counter employee join in to gang up on us while we repack our baggage. Really wish even budget airplanes treat their passengers with respect and care.",1
"Singapore to Jakarta. Plane left and arrived on time. The bare-bones facilities were not much of an issue on this short flight, so unlike on long-haul, Scoot was fine for this journey.",0
"Our flight from Sydney to Honolulu was cancelled after standing in line for 3 hrs. Tired frustrated customers then had to be insulted by the Jetstar spokesman who simply kept reiterating that any costs involved in missed forward flights, accommodation etc were our fault if we had not taken out travel insurance  he likened it to hiring a car. I researched 5 different travel insurance providers and none would insure against an airline cancelling their own flight only against weather. Jetstar did not reply to my query as to whether our flight was cancelled due to engineering problems and if so why wasnt another aircraft provided or due to an unfilled flight which several passengers had been told was the reason. Jetstar did offer $60 vouchers with an expiry date of 6 months  I asked if these could be transferred or extended as we did not intend to travel in that period and of course the response was no. The cancelled flight caused many passengers grief, in our case it set the stage for a nightmare 5 days of missed ongoing flights with huge rebooking fees (being Easter it was a nightmare getting seats on flights), missed hire car bookings, missed hotel and car hire, lost luggage meaning the same clothes for 5 days. Jetstar customer service responded that 'Section 9.1 of our Conditions of Carriage does state that flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us. This information is available on our website and you agree to it when you make your booking.' Jetstar is not a cheap airline, in fact there are times it is more expensive than Qantas and Virgin  we booked Jetstar because it fitted in with our dates. United Airlines and Delta Airlines were both involved in our 5 missed flights and both were amazingly helpful in getting us from Honolulu to New York and even changed our flight for the second time without charge  why cant Jetstar treat its passengers with the same consideration. Jetstar get into the real world and offer your customers service and if you mess up make it right, your customers should not have to be out of pocket for your mistake.",1
Manila to Legazpi. Flight left Manila on-time. This is the second time for me flying on Cebu Pacific's ATR-78 and the experience was great on this small aircraft resulting to fast & efficient service both on ground and on air due to aircraft's small carrying capacity. The flight time though is a bit longer. All in all it was a good flight in one of the aircraft I like.,0
"Don't normally use low cost airlines, apart from Air Asia who tend to do a good job. Kuala Lumpur to Nha Trang with Air Asia offering the only direct flight, check in if you have bags is not easy but otherwise boarding was done well. The seat was comfortable enough for this short 2 hour flight. Departed on tie and arrived a little early. Returning check in much nicer experience, had pre-assigned seats with extra legroom, also ordered food on this leg which was actually fine. Departed on time arrived back in KL on time, bags off quickly great service.",0
Bangkok DMK to Siem Reap Cambodia on 24 November. First time on Air Asia. A320 arrived late but plane was turned around quicker than normal. Gate agents never said anything about the delay which I hate - just say the flight is late. We departed 20 minutes late and arrived in Siem Reap about 10 minutes late. Short 50 minute flight. Plenty of leg room (I'm 175 cm) and had a seat in the middle open so plenty of room. Flight attendants very friendly. Didn't eat or drink but snacks looked reasonably priced. Luggage was off quickly - immigration took forever but that isn't Air Asia's fault. Very nice airline and flew a couple days later again.,0
"Sapporo to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. We had to wait 3 hours after arriving in Kuala Lumpur to board our next available flight. We promptly informed the fly thru staff that we have a checked in baggage on our ticket from Japan to Kuala Lumpur which also needs to be transferred. She said it has been done. However we reached Singapore airport to find our baggage missing! Still following up with authorities for tracking my missing baggage. Never have had such bad service.  They seem cheap but make up all their money on baggage, food, seat selection etc.",1
Praya/Lombok to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2) as a HiFlyer. I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.,0
"Singapore to Nanjing. I was travelling with my wife and she is 5months pregnant. Upon boarding, the air crew were very attentive helping my wife with her bags as there was a gap between the bridge and the plane. On flight, the chief stewardess drop by and make sure my wife is all ok and comfortable. She told us not to hesitate to ask for anything e.g. hot water, blanket. During the flight, my wife wanted to go to the lavatory and the chief stewardess help her with the door and into the cubicle. My wife can't stop sharing about how well she was treated on board with her friends and relatives. Thanks Scoot for the great flight.",0
Recently flew SIN-MNL and just pleased with the overall experience on flying with 5J. Check-in at SIN was easy with the web-check-in desk the plane was spotless crew was very pleasant and best of all getting to land in NAIA Terminal 3. I have flown with 5J since the late 90's with their DC9's and have been lucky to have never experienced the problems many have listed here.,0
AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing. AirAsia is ok for the price will consider using them again for flights to and from Malaysia.,0
"Singapore to Taipei on a narrow body aircraft. We did not opt for food, in flight entertainment or checked in baggage. The seats were acceptable but the leg space was rather narrow. The toilets are clean but just that since it is a smaller airplane there are few cubicles and we had to wait. On the return journey, we sat on a wide body (2 aisle) plane, leg space was better, there were more toilets and cabin crew were attentive. In general, the staff are polite and ready to help. The airline is alright for a budget airline. A tip when booking flights is to wait for the price drop and get notified,",0
Had one of the worst experiences with IndiGo during a very critical moment. We had booked our flight 3 months ago. Our flight was from Trivandrum to Patna via Bengaluru. While we wer in Thiruvananthapuram we got a phone call from IndiGo 2 days prior to our departure saying that one my flights has been canceled and other one rescheduled. I was suppose to leave Trivandrum at 8:00 am and reach Patna by 3:00pm afternoon and we had to travel all the way to Nepal in order to attend a meeting on the very next day. IndiGo screwed us very bad and said they will provide us with a different flight but both on separate days. Now I am here in Trivandrum airport one day earlier to my actual departure and waiting for my flight which has been delayed once again. Now I will reach Bengaluru at midnight where I have to stay for 12 hours waiting for my next flight. Now my time and money are completely wasted. Staying over night in Bengaluru costs minimum 5000 and on top I'm stuck here wasting my time when I had to attend a party. This will be last and final flight that I will book with IndiGo.,1
"Sunshine Coast to Sydney. The worst customer experience ever experienced. Cancelled flights with no option for 24hr rebook. Staff also asked to scan boarding pass from phone, didnt return it and when we were looking through the airport for the phone played dumb.",1
"You think I would have learned my lesson after 90% or so of flights I have taken with Lion Air have been delayed. Now sitting on the floor in the crowded waiting lounge as no seats are available with another 2 hour delay, just announced at take off schedule. Not fun with 2 small children. Last month my return flight to Bali was delayed by 3 hours each way. Also don't bother with trying to check in on the app. It does not work. I will never book with this airline again. Not worth the problems for the cheaper price.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. This budget airline, Jetstar impresses me. The check in process was smooth and fast. Boarding was efficient. Ground crew and FAs were friendly, helpful and seem proud of their work. Plane took off and landed on time. No entertainment and food, typical of a budget airline but OK since it was only 40 minutes. Overall, a great flight.",0
Horrible customer service. Cancelled flights last minute then only alternative option given landing changed my arrival time from 9am to 3:00pm with a four hour stop over. They refused to check bags through so I had to go through the entire check in service and security check again after having to wait a few hours outside before I could even check in again. Checking in took a ridiculous amount of time. Honestly horrible customer service what an absolute shower of a day. I had to cancel multiple pre booked thing due to this and no apologies given by the airline.,1
I just returned from Hawaii on jq3/4 and would like to say what a good flight both ways. The crew were delightful and the seating very comfortable. There were long lines at the check in and there were long lines at the other airline check in counters but they moved along and were very efficient. The biggest problem I observed was the minority demanding public that seem to think it was their right to have everything go their own way. I can only imagine that it was this mob that left their seating space like a tip once we had disembarked.,0
"Berlin to Ho Chi Minh City via Singapore. Terrible experience. Low-cost airline, but unreliable one. I booked and paid for my all luggage (45kg). Then, when I checked in, the system didn't show my payment for the luggage. I only could send 25kg, the rest I had to handle by myself and keep in Germany and deliver by other means. There was no one from Scoot in Berlin Tegel airport, the check-in staff were from the airport - not from the airline, so they said they couldn't handle that. I showed all documents to them, but they still didn't accept because the system didn't show. I tried bunch of times to call and contact someone from Scoot, but the phone calls were failed (they showed on the website that they serve 24/7, I called at 7am to 7h30 am, I just had only 2 hours before my departure, no one picked the phone). Scoot was so bad in customer service. The first time with Scoot is the last time, in my case. Now, one of my luggage is still in Germany and I have to pay again for other delivery, so terrible.",1
"Sydney to Ayers Rock. When doing my check-in we board 2 bags weighing around 22/23 kgs. each (I had in my contract 30 kgs each). Nobody asked about my 2 hand-bags. When waiting at the gate, they call to weigh hand-bags. They said it was 8 something kgs each and we had to pay 65 AUS$ or they wouldnt allow boarding. I tried to explain that must be said on check-in but the lady on duty in a very unfriendly voice said ""pay or move away"". I did pay and later on I watched our flight was almost empty. Its not a question of weight, just a question of collecting money.",1
Appalling service. The flight from Christchurch to Auckland was cancelled. No pre-warning. This is the second time I have experienced this with Jetstar in one month. It's hard to be professional and get to a meeting in another city if you travel with Jetstar Airways. They offer a range of reduced price seats which tempts patrons to use their service. Price is irrelevant if the plane doesn't fly.,1
"DMK-SIN was flown using an old B777 aircraft even though SCOOT website listed it as a B787 flight at time of ticket purchase. While the B787 would have been a newer and more comfortable aircraft, I did not mind the equipment change for this short sector. However, the aircraft air-conditioning malfunctioned just before push-back making the cabin hot and stuffy. Despite this, passengers were not allowed to disembark the aircraft while the fault was being fixed. Cabin crew seemed disinterested and appeared disgruntled. It was only after several complaints from passengers did the cabin crew allow passengers onto the jetway. For this, no announcements were made for obvious reasons - the jetway soon became crowded. 6 airport security personnel were brought in. Cups of water were handed out to make the delay more bearable. The aircraft departed about 90 mins late. To add insult to injury, baggage was delayed in Singapore by 2 hours due to lightning risk. No representative from SCOOT was present to provide assistance or updates. Passengers had to wait clueless of how long the delay was going to last. This despite SCOOT extremely steep baggage fees. SCOOT's basement fares translate into rock-bottom service, which can make the experience extremely painful if things don't go as planned.",1
"Perth to Jakarta via Singapore. Booked a Scoot flight for 31st May with a 6 hour stopover in Singapore. A few days ago advised flight from Perth to Singapore was cancelled and put on another flight (SQ) a day early on 30 May. Looked online to view available flights on the 31st and there was another SQ flight on the 31st May with similar departure time to my original Scoot flight. They did not allow me to change flight as it they do not have authority over SQ flights (same organization that moved me from Scoot to SQ in the first place), forcing me to stay longer in Singapore.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Sandakan. I enjoyed my flight. Check in, given KLIA 2 is such a hectic airport, was not too bad. The flight was quite punctual as well. The prepaid food I ordered was quite tasty. Much better in fact then Jetstar. The staff were efficient and helpful as well.",0
BKK-MNL was very good value for money. Paid for the extra legroom in Row 1 and also the extra 5kg. Very smooth check in and boarding and flight was on time. Crew friendly and there was food and drink available for purchase.,0
"Tokyo to Bangkok. 2 hours waiting in the plane, after that they say flight cancelled and give us 9 us$ Voucher for food. We lost our next flight and hotel in Bangkok but they do not refund us for that.",1
Flew recently from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was delayed 2 hours. Notification when I was already on my way to the airport. Also cheap is something else with all the add ons you end up paying double to the advertised price. Had better experiences with Lionair / Tigerair for flights in Asia. No space in the aircraft and a small water costs 3$.,1
Luggage service is terrible. Both ways I lost luggage at destination and the guy just say its because flight is full so they cannot bring all the luggage.,1
Out of the 9 Air Asia flights I took in May and June 2014 5 of those flights were late by more than 40 mins. Another bug I have with Air Asia is that they do not notify passengers of flight changes dates etc. They simply change itineraries and let passengers find out themselves. I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore. Scoot are far more reliable and a similar price ex Sydney. Once my pre-booked flights for 2015 are used it's bye bye to Air Asia for me. Too little too late! 50% good is not good enough!,1
"Queenstown to Sydney. After waiting almost an hour and a half to check our bags with extremely snippy and rude staff, we then were rudely herded like cattle onto the plane itself. There's no food or drink, not even a peanut or pretzel. The level of service, or lack there of, is appalling. And of course, they charge for every little possible thing. Not worth it, pay the $100 more for a smoother and easier trip on another airline.",1
Flew SYD/KUL and the KUL/PHUKET return. All flights on time web check in was good and saved long queues at the airport easily checked bags in at Sydney that were checked all the way through. No food or entertainment this was expected so was not a problem. Travelled with our 4 kids ensured they had colouring in books iPods etc. Flight was fine at the end of 9 hrs flying they were ready to get off but behaved well without normal flight gadgets. Also took my own food on board was not stopped and didn't have a problem. Staff not very friendly and don't bother you at all. Overnight flight home tried for Premium upgrade was not successful very difficult to sleep although the flight did seem quicker at night. Would recommend as long as you realise it is a budget airline.,0
"I purchased a Premium Economy seat and paid for a lie flat bed. Despite attempting to confirm my seats many times prior to departure, when checking in I was told that there are no lie flat beds on this flight. In fact the aircraft is only economy seating. I tried numerous times over a period of one week to contact their staff for a refund. Their chat bot is totally useless so I left messages, tried calling their overseas offices and always received just a voice message to leave a short message with email or phone number. Nothing! It's obvious that they cannot afford proper customer support service or are simply not interested and don't care. I have just checked online again for the same flights in September and they offer economy seats at $327 USD or premium economy at $853 USD. This airline has only one objective, take your money and if you have a problem don't contact us.",1
"Flight delayed by 5 hours with no explanation. Seat layout 3x3x3,  9 across width of plane so very cramped and very narrow aisles when staff pushing trolley down isle. $5 if you want water. Want to charge your phone or other device - $9 charge! Also had credit card comprised via Scoots ""bid for biz"" process from inside Scoot as email included every detail relating to myself and flight details. Resulted in cancellation of credit card 48 hours out from travel. No interest in this whatsoever from Scoot staff even though this could also happen to any travellers on Scoot. Customer support line also left a lot to be desired - very difficult to get them to understand the issue and gave up after one and half hours on phone to them. Never again Scoot, you lost me and my six travelling companions.",1
DPS-CGK new B737-900. The aircraft condition although it is brand new but dirty many spots on the leather seat trash on the carpet which shows that they do not clean it properly. FA only did the safety demonstration do the snack & drinks selling and the rest of the flight they chit chat on the pantry. Some of the FA announcement are recorded. Another things some passengers are still doing some activity while the fasten seat belt sign is on and the FA did not warn the passenger to go back to their seat. I believe that Lion Air should upgrade their services and FA skills/knowledge.,1
"Gold Coast to Sydney. Worst airline I have ever flown with, a delay leaving Sydney 30 mins which isnt too bad, but delayed 2.5 hours leaving Gold Coast. Announcement By tannoy but not one Jetstar member gateside of the airport so had now way of being able to speak to someone. Delay only announced 10 mins before original boarding time so most people already waiting at gate. Very disappointed not to see any Jetstar staff - definitely not travelling with them again.",1
"Singapore to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways business class. Boeing 787 new and quite quiet in the front. Hate the electronic window shading, was in control of the cabin staff so it was either all open or all dark. It was a night flight and I was watching the huge fires and some wicked lightening storms till they darkened the windows for people to sleep. Sorry but what was happening out the window was better than the in-seat entertainment. The seat has plenty of leg room but I don't think there was one seat where the recline/foot rest worked properly - there was a lot of times when the cabin crew were wrestling with seat. Recline is huge but you're reclining into the space of the person behind you. It happened to me - the tiny TV drops to where you can't view it unless your neck is double-jointed. You can't get up to go to the toilet without some contortions and using the headrest of the seat in front and then you receive that disgusted look because you woke them up.  Entertainment small screen was just that, small, very small and not great quality. And I ran out of movies to watch about 3 hours from touchdown on a 7.5 hour flight. What an awful poor choice - and in Business class! Food not quite as good as other airlines economy food. I was in row 2 of business class and they ran out of the first choice in row 2. Well actually they didn't run out because our friends (also in row 2) shortly after being fobbed off with the fish, noted that row 2 and 3 of the other side of the business cabin got the first choice. So that's a bit of an insult to be told that it's out to then watch people being served it after you. First choice - a Pie, no veggies, no potatoes, nothing but a pie! Had to check I was in business class! Drinks offer a good choice, and always there if you wanted it. Cabin staff were mainly good and attentive (not that we wanted much) but a bit disappointed with the lack of checking for meals. Goodies Pack was great:- earplugs, eye mask, toothbrush, tube socks (not so great), hand cream, lip balm, neck pillow and the bag it came in can be used as a computer tablet bag. There is one thing that all airlines should realize; tube socks don't work in the toilet (think about it). Ground service I've marked low for one reason - although we were the first off the plane we were last away from the baggage carousel as our bags came out last (that will teach us to be first at the airport!) Business class baggage came out last! Overall the whole thing was very amateurish, I wasn't expecting top of the line business class, but it should have been up to at least premium economy standards of other airlines. Not sure how they can market this as business class. I doubt I will use them again for this sort of travel.",1
"Athens to Singapore. Experience was okay. Although 11 hours on a budget flight was a bit too much for me. No one checked our carry-on luggage when we checked in at the counter and at the gate, nor cared when we ate outside food on the flight. A guy we recently met had 3 bags due to finding a sleeping bag at a festival but he wasn't told he was over the luggage limit and brought it on the flight. My boyfriend experienced a problem when his boarding pass was scanned. Apparently his seat number got changed after check-in and was moved from a window seat to an aisle seat. Because all the seats in my row were occupied, I couldn't get much sleep or relaxation during the 11 hour flight. Luckily when we arrived in Changi Airport, where we could sleep at a snooze lounge at 5am. Also, the flight attendant call button is located at the handrest area so people kept accidentally pushing it.",0
Chandighar to Goa. Flight was fully booked and was good. Only thing to spoil it was parents note-taking responsibility for their kids. I was amazed how good and tolerant the flight crew were. I certainly wouldn't have been. Flight we were on was a all female crew from captain to stewardess.,0
Sydney to Singapore return. Outward leg May 3 return May 26. ScootBiz is a 100% premium over the economy cabin and it just isn't worth it. Is more legroom more incline and free meal worth double? Is priority check in a bonus when your bags are the last to be unloaded at the other end? Scoot will have to increase its 'biz' offer substantially or lower the premium (substantially) to have me flying it again.,1
"Puerto Princesa to Manila. We have now been flying with this airline 3 times, and two of these times we had delays for around 1 hour. When flying back from Puerto Princesa we were asked to check in what had been our carry on baggage going here. The bags weights were less than 10 kilos, soft, full of clothes, and size is according to normal standards for airlines and our previous flights with air Asia. When we asked for the reason they told its due to safety reason.  So we had to pay the check-in fee and board.",1
Flew with Jetstar from MEL to BNE using a price match fare which was booked quickly by the polite Jetstar agent over the phone. Ground staff at MEL airport were polite and assisted with checking our two bags (under my name) onto the flight. The flight attendants boarding the flight at the gate were extremely rude yelling at passengers to move forward in the long queue. Once onboard the service was better and the crew were quite friendly at times offering to retrieve bags from the overhead compartment. One of my bags didn't arrive in Brisbane - which is curious because it was checked in at the same time as the other bag. I was told that it didn't make it onto the flight and that they would only be able to send it by courier the next day. Overall you get what you pay for but I wouldn't travel with Jetstar on a flight longer than 2.5 hours.,1
"I recently visited Australia after a three year absence, thanks to Covid. Even though international travel conditions are now easier, I still had to make several date and route changes which in turn impacted my domestic bookings with Jetstar. The good news is that I was able to make the necessary changes (via phone, not on-line) and the call-center staff were very helpful. The resulting invoice, however, contained the following terms which I'm guessing few passengers would understand: Fare Credit Payment Fee Spoilage Fee System Error Fee Call Center Offset - Spoilage Fee It seems that these are 'creative accounting' terms used to avoid making refunds when passengers change to a lower lost fare. A brief search of the Internet revealed that I'm not the only passenger wondering exactly what these terms mean (beyond the fact that the passenger should pay). Perhaps it's time to amend accounting standards to require that Invoices include a Glossary of Terms.",0
"I have had a mixed experience flying with Scoot. My flight to Athens from Sydney was uneventful and easy, however my inflight meal which I purchased at the time of booking the ticket was quite rubbery and not hot. This isnt something Id write a bad review over, however my experience on the return flight back to Sydney has been absolutely atrocious. After attempting to purchase additional baggage online multiple times on separate devices the website failed and crashed many times. I was finally able to get through and pay for my extra check in luggage ($123) the night before the flight. Upon arriving at the airport to check in on time, I was told I was unable to because o had an outstanding balance of $83 to which they couldnt tell me what it was for, but if I didnt pay, I wouldnt fly. Not only could they not explain this fee, the attendant who was handling this issue seemed to be incompetent with their system and couldnt get it to work. Although I wasnt exactly sure what was going on because she ignored me as if I wasnt there and would stop intermittently and fill a stapler with fresh staples! This went on for so long that I had my baggage given back to me and told I had missed check in and now had missed my opportunity to get my flight. There was zero communication to myself as the customer, no attempt by the staff to be helpful or treat this as an urgent matter to assist me in getting this issue sorted out, and no apology for the fact that this was an operational fault of Scoot as an airline. I was upset at the fact that I had now missed my flight, and the attendant that had been supposedly helping me simply rolled away in her chair and sat behind a desk messing with receipts. Not to mention the huge line of frustrated and ignored people behind me waiting for assistance for a separate flight. I cant believe how horrible this experience was as a customer. I hope the airline improves on this in the near future, because Id hate for anyone else to have to go through what I experienced today.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. I purchased two meals for my flight in advance, however, I only got one meal served. I tried to contact their customer service several times and in different ways (facebook and message), but I didn't get any response. Their customer service is terrible. I definitely won't fly with AirAsia next time.",1
"By far the worst airlines in Asia. The customer service is made to be as long and difficult as possible. You either have to find solutions with BO chat (useless AI) or hope they respond to your email. My account got locked by AirAsia because they don't send me an OTP for verification, even though I verified myself months ago. Due to my account being locked I can not proceed to make flight changes and any other bookings for a trip I am planning. It takes 15 to 20 days to unlock my account. I asked if they can cancel all my flights instead and give me a refund because of the problem and delays they caused and I can't get my money back. I highly recommend that you should check out any other alternative airlines first before using AirAsia. It can be a smooth transaction but whenever there is a problem you are going to have so many unnecessary problems with this airlines. And you will struggle to find a real person to talk to because everything is with the AI chat system first.",1
"Flew with AirAsia from Denpasar Bali to Yogyakarta and back. Both times were delayed, one by 2hrs one by 35mins and I did not receive any notification of this delay. I guess lesson learned, you get what you pay for. At least let me know when my flight is going to be delayed, never flying them again.",1
"To say this airline is bad is an understatement. In putting together a complex itinerary for my wife, it was overlooked to prepay for one extra bag (weighing 22kg) on her flight from Manila to Bohol. A simple oversight, right? Nope. We had to shell out $110 USD not only for the extra bag, but they also weighed the carry on and it was like 1kg over the ridiculous 7kg limit. How much did the charge me for this? more than 5x the prepay.  My wife was supposed to arrive a good 5 hours before the flight, but due to delays by Hong Kong airlines, she was there 3 hours and 50 minutes before the flight. 10 minutes after the 4-hour cutoff (where we could have paid <$20 for all of it). The staff (including the supervisor) refused to do anything or make any considerations. Robots. All of them. Customer support (online) was the exact same. Nobody cared and everyone just cited the online details. So we had to pay more than the cost of the entire ticket (which was $80 or so) just to bring on an extra 22kg suitcase AND we were charged extra for a carry-on which was not heavy or unusual. This airline is nickel and diming its customers and essentially extorting money from them at the ""last minute"". Well never fly this airline again and hope others make the same decision.",1
"Honolulu to Auckland via Sydney. Jetstar is the worst airline I have ever flown with. It started before the departure. We booked our flight and could not add pieces of luggage (Online). When we wanted to check in at the airport, the staff then explained we have to pay 101. Who travels for without any piece of luggage?  I already paid a lot of money for the flight. During the flight, we then realized that we do not get any food unless we buy an overpriced snack. Honestly, I pay for a flight (Honolulu to Sydney) and there is no single food offered?  Twice the flight attendant brought us 1 cup of water. Coffee should cost 3.50, in my opinion, even incomprehensible. Movies, music and other one had of course to pay for - as an example, you could buy (about 4 minutes length) for $5 music video. At the end I can say confidently that Jetstar is the worst airline ever, excuse my language.







Peace",1
"My first time flying Zip Air was a very pleasant experience. Easy check in at Narita Airport, polite and helpful check in staff. The boarding was on time and very easy. The aircraft was clean and modern, the seats were 100% reclinable and Business cubes, you were provided a travel pack. The pre ordered meal was excellent and fresh. The flight attendant's were checking if I needed anything and appeared to enjoy their job. This low coast Japan Airlines owned Airline has changed what it is like to fly on a low cost carrier, I will definitely fly with them again. I hope they will increase their flight destinations. Am a real fan of Zip Air",0
"27th May 2019 Air Asia Flight I5 1582, between Bengaluru to Hyderabad. Impressed with the energy of Inflight Crew. So focussed and guest centric. Smiling and well groomed. Special thanx to Lakshman to offer his meal. Short of cash.",0
Flew from Mumbai to Bangalore with IndiGo. As we entered the aircraft we were warmly welcomed. Though we had to buy food but it didn't create any issues. The food tasted fantastic and seats were quite comfortable. The cabin crew was polite.  Overall flight experience was fantastic and I would keep travelling with them.,0
"It was a horrible experience. We had 2 flights via IndiGo to arrive in Thailand and 2 flights to return, and all flights were delayed. Very small cabins, non-friendly staff, dirty seats, and the plane smelled of food.  I will do my best to avoid this airline in the future.",1
"Taipei to Da Nang. Not only are the planes as basic as possible, but the staff is beyond unprofessional and will even attempt to scam money from customers. I was traveling with three people and we had two checked bags: they attempted to put them both onto one passenger, to increase the cost for the second bag, without telling me. They have a ""rewards program"" that offers a discount on the flight, but then they don't tell you that it automatically renews a year later (after you've done your best to forget this Godawful airline). Avoid at all costs.",1
"Manila to Sydney. To start, to enter the gate you have to go through Cebus own security. Thats after youve already been through security of the airport. Then youll have to empty your water bottles that you purchased at the shops within the airport. There are no toilets or water facilities inside their gate. Our flight was one hour late at the gate and there were no announcements to advice why the plane was late. The. Once boarded we waited about 1.5 hours with changing messages as to why our flight was late to depart. The seats are horrible. There cushioning has a crease in the middle meaning you cannot sit in the chair longer than an hour At the end of the day, you get what you pay for, so do I really have the right to complain? Yes I do. Theres just to many areas to highlight. Will never use Cebu Pacific for a long haul international again.",1
Indigo flight service has worsened a lot as they do frequent reschedules and cancellations. Please avoid booking on Indigo especially if you are on an official trip or have a doctors appointment or a connecting flight. Please go for other flights instead of Indigo,1
Sydney to Denpasar. I have been planning this holiday for a few months. I booked it months in advance for a good price to leave today 19/05/2019 and includes my birthday. I woke up today to the news that my flight was cancelled due to engineering problems. I have used their web chat with 2 people and the customer service response from them was appalling. Both of them thought it was appropriate to say they were sorry for the inconvenience and that I could either rebook it refund. I went the rebook route as it was the easiest for me. So now I will leave on the 21/05/2019 losing 2 days of my holidays. I asked one of them for a refund on my lost accommodation and she said they don't accept liability for this. I would have used my insurance but after the excess was paid it wouldn't have been worth it. I then asked for an upgrade or voucher and she said Jetstar don't offer this. Thanks Jetstar for becoming the worst airline In my eyes. Your service and lack of compassion is your customer service,1
"My wife and I traveled from NZ to Gold Coast via Sydney. We had 1 luggage bag 15kg purchased and of course cabin luggage (including laptop etc). No problem on NZ-Sydney, but boarding flight in Sydney, we got called by Jestar staff to weigh our cabin bags. We had few kgs over. After some repacking, (putting jackets on) it was only 1kg over the limit. We explained that we had extra 1kg in luggage (our bag was 14kg) and that it was laptop and we traveled internationally to no avail. They took our boarding passes and rushed us to pay $60 fee. I said may be we can re-pack (I had few old magazines there and battery pack for mobile, which I could put in the pocket). But they said we will miss our flight. They basically, extorted money from us and other passengers quickly. I complained online , but their customer service repeat the same mantra, that it is correct. Overall, they ruined experinece over 1kg and aim was to charge money and fast , not to accommodate customers. Horrible Jetstar, rude and not understanding. We will avoid when possible.",1
11 April 2015 Departed HCM to Da Nang. The bus to the aircraft was full but plenty of wiggle room. The aircraft departed on-time everything worked and the crew was friendly and helpful. I was seated in the emergency exit room and it was great with plenty of leg room. Great price appeox. $41 USD. Next trip with them is 15 April from Da Nang to Hanoi. Will post results.,0
"Iloilo to Manila. The flight was delayed. Yes most of the time the reason is traffic, which I would assume, is not the airline's fault. Wish they could coordinate to provide a decent wifi service for passengers in case flight gets delayed. It helps to keep our attention from the delay. We did online check in so no interaction with ground crew. Smooth booking process and online check in. Cabin crew were friendly, could smile a bit more at passengers.",0
"From Perth to Melbourne for a conference on 13th, day before cancelled to fly out at around 5pm with Qantas then delayed until after 8, eventually arrived in Melbourne accomodation at 4am. Had to be at conference at 8am. To add insult to injury today we are again cancelled and rescheduled to leave at 6.50pm after our initial booking was at 10am. I will never fly with Jetstar again",1
"Flight was leaving at 23.15 and after an hour and a half flying had to get back to airport due to a medical emergency of a passenger. Upon landing we were left inside the plane in the tarmac until 4:15 am and told to deplane and pick up our luggage and flight would be cancelled. Zipair did not take responsibility for the passengers and just left everyone to sort themselves out at 5am, even families with small children,  their reply was oh, there are many hotels in Bangkok. When these situations have occurred to me always airline took to hotel, specially once we had already left ground. They didnt offer anything at all at the time Flight was rescheduled for the next day at the same time.. upon checking in at 10pm or so, they offered a meal voucher of 300THB as compensation couldn't they have given the voucher in the morning and not just an hour before leaving. Will not recommend to anyone",1
Mataram Lombok to Denpasar. We arrived at the airport 15.00 for our 17.40 flight and according to staff and the monitors the flight was on time. As the departure time passed passengers went to check-in staff and asked what was happening we were informed the flight would be delayed and would depart at 22.15. No reason given for the delays. 22.15 came and still no sign of a flight. At 22.50 I went to the check-in staff and demanded to know what was happening. Nobody knew and they informed us the flight must have been cancelled and we would probably be taken to Denpasar the following morning. Finally a time came in at 00.15am some 10 hrs after we had checked in. I am angry that staff did not keep us informed of what was happening and still today we do not know why the plane was delayed more than 8 hours. Extremely poor service by not only Lion Air but the ground staff as well.,1
My Jetstar experience began with the website not taking my booking properly and checked baggage wasn't booked. For this they charged me an additional $70 to check my 7kg bag on a flight that didn't cost much more for myself. Flight was late took an extremely long time getting on board due to lack of organisation. Probably the most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced. The hostess was snarly. I ordered an iPad for the flight and the selection was terrible.,1
"Cairns to Perth with Jetstar Airways. The customer service was ok, the cabin crew were amazing. My inflight entertainment wouldn't work properly. Angry that my luggage didn't make the flight from Cairns to Perth and on the way back my second bag can not be located! Not impressed at all.",0
"We booked and paid for our Jetstar Airways flights from Bali to Melbourne, direct flights. Two hours before check in, I get an email saying the flight has been cancelled because of engineering requirements. We had to re book our flights at a later date, and the best we could get was Bali to Brisbane and then Brisbane to Melbourne. That's ok, what I'm not ok with is been charged extra money by Jetstar for a 4 hour longer flight and being offered zero compensation. A joke of a company with terrible customer service.",1
Cebu to Manila A319. Checkin very slow and seemed quite disorganised. Although aircraft was new seating very tight and uncomfortable. I was assigned a window seat on the last row which had no window and was so cramped that it proved to be one of the worst seats I have had to endure. It was impossible to sit in a normal fashion as my knees were pinned against the seat in front of me. I understand Cebu Pacific are a budget airline but I would eagerly pay more not to endure such seating again.,1
"I will never go with this low-cost airline again. Boeing 787 from Singapore to Athens, on a 11 hour flight I expect a tv and and at least a free bottle of water for the money you pay, but got nothing! If you wanted water you had to pay. It was shocking, never again.",1
"I have used this airline numerous times over the past couple of years and there is one thing you can almost always be sure of, your flight will be late (and I'm not counting delays caused by Manila air traffic control). Be prepared for cancelled flights (often at the last minute). My last flight (Manila to Cebu) was 90 minutes late due to 'a problem with the aircraft'. Tardiness apart, everything else was pretty much as one would expect from a no-frills airline. The staff were okay, check-in passable, the cabin was a little dirty with breadcrumbs on my seat.",1
Just flew four sectors with AirAsia and couldn't fault except for limited menu options at the end of the flight from Sydney to KL. Only complaint would be about their partner optiontown. I paid for an upgrade and booking fee for 2 via their website about 2 months prior to our flight. About 4 hours before the flight I received an email saying our flight upgrade was unsuccessful. We got on the plane to an announcement that there were upgrades available to business class for almost double what we originally paid - 4 in fact. We feel ripped off. I do not accept their were 4 business class cancellations. Either Air Asia or their partner Optiontown are guilty of charging our booking fee for no service.,0
I flew on Air Asia from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi on November 9th 2017. Everything on this trip was excellent. Refreshments were available for purchase. Boarding was handled efficiently aided by the new design at terminal KLIA2. Was given seat 1B as the flight was full and I did not have to pay extra for boarding first.,0
"Lion Air 8pm flight Bengkulu to Jakarta March 2. Flight 2.5 hours late leaving. No announcements had to ask for constantly changing information. No compensation when one customer complained and at last minute Padang food appeared with no implements to eat and way too late. Onboard they briefly apologized as flight late for ""operational reasons"". My understanding is this is a common occurrence for this flight. This airline has no customer care or communications capability.",1
"Bali to Jakarta. First, they rescheduled my flight from 15:50 become 16:00. Now, they said it will delay become 16:50. They have no shame about delay everytime. Its so bad. They delayed so many times. It hard to trust this airplane. Nice I only will used this airplane three times. No more.",1
"This was the final flight of our ill conceived use of Scoot to fly to and from Vietnam. This was yet another flight that was rescheduled without advice to us by Scoot. Our original booking would have seen us travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore to Perth in the course of a day rather than have an enforced stopover of 18 hours in Singapore which allowed time to eat, bathe and sleep before returning to the airport. Boarding was disorganised and the flight was delayed upon departure by about an hour. Our pre booked seats were changed without advice and we ended up four rows from the toilets at various times there was the overpouring stench of stale urine in the cabin. both my partner and I used the toilets and prior to her being able to use them she had to do a clean with disinfectant wipes and tissues. Disgraceful it reflects poorly on the airline, cabin crew and our fellow passengers personal hygiene practices. None of our flights with Scoot departed on schedule each flight was re scheduled without notification to us. What is unfortunate about this experience is part of our decision was based upon past travel with Singapore Airlines, Scoots parents company. It is not a good look to be associated with such a poorly operated and managed low cost carrier who has little care or concern for its passengers. In Singapore Airlines case its association with Scoot is a race to the bottom. Scoot is little more than riding a public bus.",1
Did BOM-MAA once and doing my second today. Great crew. Very helpful at check-in. Courteous onboard and new aircraft's. Only hitch is food. While ticket rates are on par with Jet and AI particularly after KF problems one has to buy food and that too from a limited choice. Pre-booking is there but the website does not guide as to how.,0
It was a morning flight from Kuala Lumpur to Padang with AirAsia. The flight took off a bit late but arrived on time. The flight was quite full but everything was done in an orderly fashion. The flight went well and did not encounter turbulence nearly all the way. Landing was smooth.,0
"The flight was delayed by nearly an hour without any explanation or apology from the airline. The plane was dirty, with debris and an empty water bottle left near my seat that affected the cleanliness of my personal belongings. Overall, I am frustrated with my experience with Qantas and its affiliates. I hope to see some competition in the airline industry to improve the quality of service in this country.",1
"I reviewed this previously and this post is to verify my previous claim and comments but also to post the response from Scoot Customer Service, or lack thereof. At no time did we seek a refund from Scoot what we sought was that they come to the party with a nights accommodation for the enforced layover in Singapore. They never responded to any emails until we had returned to Australia and then waited several days before doing so. I have included the text of their email for readers benefit. Dear A Thank you for writing to us. We refer to your refund request for Scoot booking received through our Online Feedback Form. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience caused to the change in flight schedule that may have disrupted your travel plan. We understand the impact on our passengers when there are changes in our flight schedule. However, we want to reassure you that we will only make changes if necessary. As schedules are subject to changes, Scoot will make every effort to get our passengers to their destination within a reasonable time from their original schedule. We regret that we are unable to offer any options. We seek your understanding on this occasion if our service level did not meet your expectation. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to seeing you onboard. Yours sincerely, Scoot shall never enjoy our continued support and they will never see us onboard again.",1
"Beijing to Siem Reap via Kuala Lumpur. I cancelled my flight on Jan 30 due to covid-19, a case was created by Air Asia on Jan 30 to give me full refund. From AVA, it takes up to 30 working days to process a refund. Today is March 27, 41 working days have passed, no refund was received yet. I contacted Air Asia many times through twitter but no response and no refund.",1
"Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur. I have no words to express my severe disappointment in this airline and will never fly with them again. They have no concept of customer service, experience or satisfaction.",1
"Turkish Airlines have partnered with Indigo Airline for route Istanbul to Mumbai and this was my worst experience until now. The Aircraft was really old.  For meal they have served just a packing and a bread. Spoons and butter knife was of wood. Any sort of Alcohol is paid, even a wine. The very basic IFE was just blank white screen.",1
"App is very nice looking, easy to use and never had an issue. I was able to book the ticket in no time. Interior of the flight requires some enhanced cleaning. They enforced the ones occupying middle seat to wear PPE. Cabin crew were nice, helpful, paid attention to all the unwanted needs of unruly passengers. I liked the bamboo cutleries, which is environmentally friendly rather than the plastic ones. Flight reached Delhi before the time and luggage came out on time. Everything was great except one major problem I had. I pre-booked my meal, which was a paneer salad. Salad was served with a bread roll. When I opened the bag, I found the bread had mould.  I showed it to a cabin crew, and she was apologetic and offered any food, drinks I want. I declined her offer and returned the paneer salad.",0
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. I have taken several flights from AirAsia. Flight delay is a norm. Had enough of flight delay from this airlines. The turnaround time for plane is just too short. One delay will have an impact on the downstream flight.,1
"Melbourne to Hobart. Worst airline for punctuality flying Australian domestic routes. This airlines website provided no flight delays on their app 1 hour prior to arrival. Staff could not provide a reason, when queried, As to why the flight was so delayed. If you have commitments at your destination dont fly with them, it is an airline of last resort.",1
"Avoid this airline! Despite half airplane empty they didn't let us sit on empty rows. We had to suffer in cramped rows just because of ""their policy"". Staff treat passengers like cattle. We are never flying this airline again.",1
"My Bangkok to Phnom Penh flight in October 2022 was rescheduled and I received an email notification of the change of flight time. There was a 7.5-hour change of time, so I decided to cancel my ticket and receive a refund. I couldn't see any option to contact a member of staff, other than a bot on the AirAsia website. Since submitting my claim, I haven't received any correspondence from AirAsia. Luckily, it was a really cheap flight and I can take the loss. I certainly wouldn't book with AsiaAir again because I just wouldn't want to be placed in a similar situation.",1
Flew OOL-SIN for the first time on 25 Dec 12. Very pleasantly surprised. Although the flight was full the B777 did give the impression of spaciousness. Pleased that I had paid a little extra for an upgraded seat though. Plenty of legroom - but the armrests are very narrow. No headrests on the seats and the installation of these would be a big plus. The in-flight meals (even the upgraded ones) are no more than snacks - but that was not a big deal. There is of course no IFE. However if you are happy enough to read or use a computer the time passes quite quickly. My only criticism is that the food service was a little chaotic. Other than that Scoot represents excellent value. I'm planning to use Scoot's OOL services in future as a 'launchpad' to the multitude of destinations available from SIN. Very good value for money.,0
"Melbourne to Denpasar. Jetstar's ground service is the same compared to full-service airlines in Business Class. Dedicated check-in area in Melbourne, fast track through security and immigration and Priority Boarding. Since, I am a Qantas Platinum I had access to the First Class Lounge. Excellent lounge, by the way. Once we were onboard we were offered 3 options for departure drinks including Champagne, orange juice or water. Inflight service offered drinks with nuts, followed by starter and main course. Dessert and cheese offered from a trolley with alcohol, tea and coffee. Since the flight was only 5 hours only one meal service was offered. Throughout the rest of the flight the crew were proactive offering a snack bar. We arrived in Bali 5 hours late, because of technical issues in Melbourne. We were notified on this 4 days prior to the flight which was good. The downside was the speed of the baggage to come out at Denpasar Airport. Business class bags surprisingly came out last. Jetstar should seriously consider Priority baggage for their Business Class passengers. Overall a good, comfortable flight.",0
"I booked the inauguration flight from Kota Kinabalu to Wuhan on 22 March 2016. Upon boarding, I found out that all crew were non Chinese speaking despite the large number of passengers from China. A big disappointment was that the crew made the safety announcement in Malay. Based on my observation, the crew had communication problems in assisting and handling the requests from passengers from the moment of boarding to arriving at our destination. I have flown a number of airlines in the region and in fact Chinese speaking crew are the norm for routes with high Chinese traffic. Return flight from Wuhan (WUH) to Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Wuhan International Airport is a rather small terminal with two rows of multiple check-in counters adjacent to each other. The check-in process started at 22.00 and was prompt. Boarding was smooth despite a number of flights departed at this time. Boarding was rather efficient without cabin crew greeting passengers as soon as they stepped onboard. Communication breakdown is unavoidable as all cabin crew allocated for this flight were non Chinese speaking crew. Soon after airborne, the cabin crew brought the meal cart out, no pre booked meals were served. About two hours later, I was woken by an announcement from the crew to inform any passenger who found a lost phone to return it to them. Having found no response, the cabin crew had no choice but to permit the passenger who lost her phone to make an announcement. This was not the first time I have experienced this situation. In my previous flight, one of the cabin crew had no choice but to turn to me to assist her to communicate with the passengers.",0
BKK-MNL. I was satisfied with the level of service provided given that the price was considerably cheaper than other operators on the route. The flight time may be off putting for some departing BKK at 00.40 and arriving at 04.30. The flight was late on the date I travelled. I also used Cebu Pacific on a number of internal flights in the Philippines. I was impressed with all of them. Most were on time the staff pleasant and legroom adequate.,0
Flew from Mumbai to Bangalore with IndiGo. The check-in was good and everything went smoothly. The flight departed and arrived on-time. The cabin crew are very polite. The cushioning of the seat was hard but it didn't create any issues. The food was served hot and was very delicious. Had a great flight experience with IndiGo.,0
I flew with them from Launceston to Sydney. It was a very nice new A320 and the pilot actually told us what he was doing over the P/A. Very nice service good website nice staff. Would fly Jetstars A320s over Virgins old 737s any day.,0
Traveled PER-SIN only. The ground staff were nice enough to ask if I wanted a window seat or aisle seat during check in. Boarding went pretty quickly. The crew were helpful with my carry-on luggage on board. There were some problems with the passenger call bell button and it was quite worrying. (Probably just an old aircraft. The seats looked old and dirty but overall very spacious and comfortable. The cabin seemed warm and stuffy throughout the flight though). Safety and budget transportation was definitely the main focus of the airline. In safety aspects the crew did their seatbelt checks after the turbulence announcement and constantly doing toilet-checks and house-keeping often. Announcements by the crew could be improved in terms of clarity audibility and tone of voice. I did not try the inflight entertainment and purchase any meals. But the menu of the inflight meals and the list of inflight entertainment seemed interesting and a bit on the steep side. However definitely use this airline again because of the price and comfort.,0
"Gold Coast to Chennai via Singapore. I paid extra for extra legroom seats and for food and beverages. On boarding the aircraft, I discovered that my seats are not extra legroom seats. The staff refused to help me in any way despite having paid extra for those seats. All they offered was that I may get refund for the extra charges if I pursue with airlines office after completion of our journey. Food quality and quantity were both pathetic.",1
"Booking online was simple, as was the self check in and bag drop. However the departure gate was right at the far end of the terminal. It took ages to get to and it included various flights of stairs. Once there there wasn't anywhere near enough seating made available to sit and wait before boarding. This was made worse by very weak airconditioning. This is despite the airline requesting all passengers be there not less than 30 minutes before boarding time. It was a tiny plane. I was unable to move whilst in my seat and due to lack of space only got to make use of 1 of the 2 armrests. Cabin was dirty all over. As was the magazine which had all the puzzles filled in by previous passengers. My ticket said I was to get a $10 meal voucher but this never occurred. The menu was pretty awful anyway and staff service non-existent. It was a very boring flight even despite its brevity as there was no inflight entertainment. At least my bag came out very quickly the other end. In summary the best parts were start and finish but very poor in the middle.",0
Flew JQ91 ADL-DRW on 25th Dec 2013 and returned on JQ92 DRW-ADL on 29th Dec 2013. Both flights were on time and seats were fine. Entertainment and food were ok - you have to pay for it but for the 3.5 hour flight it is worth it. What really impressed me was the cabin staff especially from DRW to ADL. Our cabin manager was the best I have experienced. Nothing was too much trouble. I have found Jetstar hit and miss in the past. Sydney and Melbourne based crew are generally lifeless and disinterested however Darwin based crew are excellent.,0
There are no complimentary service with normal ticket. Everything is chargeable. And the flight charges is high without any inflight service.,1
"The flight from Kuala Lumpur 18:20 was first delayed and then canceled and moved to 3:30. At least 8 hours later. The explanation was bad weather. There was rain and also i heart thunder. But in the 8 hours we waited and had to sleep at the airport other airplanes flew. So it felt like there must be another option then to let us wait so long at mid night at an AirPort. We also had to beg for some food and drinks, which we eventually got, but it was not offered from first hand. Also no hotel was offered.",1
BNE-PER and return. Outward leg OK apart from the fact that this is a long flight and the seats are very uncomfortable and narrow forget about sleeping. Poor selection of food and drinks onboard. Return leg terrible: direct flight to Brisbane was split by Jetstar into a PER-MEL and MEL-BNE with 2 hour wait in MEL! Experienced rude service! Will not fly with them again.,1
"I repeatedly asked for assistance in checking in. 2 crew with IndiGo uniform pointed me and made me line up for check in counter. After 30 minutes, it was then my turn. Counter said it was local flights only. The international counter to SG was on the other side. Because of them, I was not allowed because the international counter closed 5 minutes before I arrived. I kindly asked for help from the manager. But the manager only did bare minimum. My baggage is only hand carry and immigration forms has been submitted beforehand. Just needed to print boarding pass. It was a connecting flight booked through Kiwi.com. Even after explaining and begging, they did not let me check in. I asked for help in rebooking, but they did not even help in that. I had to waste a lot of money because of their incompetence. Totally not recommended.",1
"Went on a 12 hour flight with Scoot and it was a torture. Old plane with terrible seats, worked away with back and neck pain. It was freezing cold and blankets were not offered. Everything needed to be paid for. Even water was charged. 5kg luggage overweight came at 100 charge. No onboard entertainment at all.",1
Worst experience with an airline. The flight was delayed and we were informed whilst that the aircraft has remarks which is a technical term layman cannot understand. Apparently there was something wrong with the aircraft which they tried to fix but they were unable to hence we had to use another plane. My only concern is why was the plan only checked when we already boarded and currently in the coaster literally waiting to go in the plane. If it was not safe to fly that specific plane wouldnt it be better to check it properly than rushing because the passengers are waiting? Why wait for an hour before deciding to change plane? Is it not possible to keep the passengers informed. We had a 14 hours flight from London to Manila and everything went smoothly. I was expecting this Manila-Laoag (1hour) flight to be hassle-free but it was the exact opposite. We waited far longer than the flight time.,1
"You only get what you pay for and this is the case with Jetstar, but at 2/3 the price of Qantas or Hawaiian, it makes for a cheaper alternative.  I've flown both and it's not much different between them all in economy. Service was better on return flight with the cabin staff more attentive. Food was pre booked and not bad but the breakfast on return was inedible. The Boeing 787 could be an awesome plane but with the very tight layout it makes the isles so tight that the trolleys hit seating, and this can be seen with gouges out of the seating. Watching the cabin crew try and work in those tight conditions should be an occupation hazard. The seating was comfortable, entertainment was a little light but ok for 9 hrs. Overall this is not a bad product for the price we paid.",0
I recently flew from Cebu to gold coast and I had to throw away a large amount of my carry on bag because it was over weight. My concern is not that I had to discard this stuff it's that the staff wouldn't let me do this and demanded I paid the extra at the gate. I watched them do this with a lot of people. I also watched them weigh guys laptop bags including mine but not ladies handbags. And by the time I threw away what I could I was still 800 grams over weight and they were fighting me on this till the end. When I asked to check the scales calibration they were reluctant and then let me go.,1
JQ415 OOL-SYD Airbus A320. Great end to our holiday with Jetstar. We arrived at the airport early enough to get transferred from JQ417 (departed at 13.30) to JQ415 (departed at 12.20) free of charge. Leather seats were comfortable however we didn't get to choose seats free of charge when booking. The staff were pretty friendly and the food/beverages and entertainment was good.,0
"Jetstar has canceled both the flights (Melbourne to Bali return) and both the time it was an engineering issue. They asked me to stay in the same hotel where i was staying in Bali and said that the  amount will be paid by Jetstar. When I went to claim that money, then they say there is a limitation of $150 per day and said sorry for the miscommunication.",1
"Got to the Zipair check in desk and they refuse to board us, saying we need a Japanese citizenship to transfer from Narita to a connecting flight within 24 hours. It makes no sense as even the Japanese embassy said no visa is required for connecting flight thats within 72 hours as long as you stay in international area of airport. Very unprofessional.",1
Jakarta to Singapore. Have flown this route both ways frequently and usually end up with Lion Air as they're the cheapest after you've factored in the extras with competing LCCs. Appreciate that what they say on the website is what you pay. Plane was quite new B737-900 with dreadfully cramped seats. No IFE or anything to eat or drink which was not a problem with a 1 hr 40m approx flight. Check-in at Jakarta Airport was swift. Flight was more or less on time and I will definitely use Lion again while they keep their prices as they are.,0
Scootbiz from Singapore to Shenyang China. Departure 20 mins late they served us food around 2.15am. If you couldn't eat at that time they could store your food for you and serve it to you as breakfast before arriving in Shenyang. The one hour transit in Qingdao was a tiring process - you are expected to bring along all your hand carry luggage with you. You have to clear all immigration in Qingdao. On our return flight Scoot was on time and even arrived 30 min earlier in Singapore. Seat was quite wide and rather comfy. No food served from Shenyang to Qingdao. Luckily we had brought enough of our own food. Both iPads and blankets could be rented and bought. We brought along our own iPads and downloaded their system before the flight. Overall though initially we have had a nightmarish experience of trying to change our destination from Shenyang to Tokyo everything about the Scootbiz experience was surprisingly nice for a budget airline.,0
Flew from Gold Coast to Singapore 4 weeks ago business class. Seats were as hard as a rock the food was shocking and there was supposed to be priority boarding! Never happened. I booked Air Asia Business class for return and they were great. Fully reclining seats and priority boarding. It was worth forfeiting the Scoot return fare.,1
"Hyderabad to Coimbatore. Im usually not the one to write reviews, but todays experience mandates a review. Was travelling with family, four passengers booked under the same PNR. Reached the check-in counter 1.5 hours prior to departure. Yet, we are allocated seats in four different rows. Whats the logic and reason of booking under the same PNR and arriving early, only to be left to the mercy of the staff who doesnt even consider helping us find at least 2 seats together and smirks at our misfortune.",1
"I flew from Solo to Jakarta. As a low cost airline, ticket price is the cheapest, as cheap as an economy train ticket price. Although Lion Air is known as the King of Delay, my flight was on time. The aircraft was good and new. They sold snacks on the plane if you hungry. I recommend you to fly with Lion Air if you have low budget, but if you want a comfortable one, pay extra for Garuda or Batik.",0
SIN-TPE-SIN in September. Both legs were on time leg room was good for a low cost carrier and check-in was smooth. Excellent value for money.,0
Seoul to Indonesia. My flight plan was supposed to be Seoul - Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur - Jakarta. The 2nd flight was delayed 2hrs and I missed my connecting flight in Jakarta because of that. Customer service agents didn't do anything except proposing I take the next flight (would get me stuck in Jakarta) or buy another flight ticket to my final destination. I choose the 2nd solution but didn't arrive at my final destination and lost over 200 in the end.,1
Don Muang - Phuket - Don Muang. Pre-booked assigned seats together (65bht) and meals (120 bht) in booking. Both flights excellent value at promo fares offered and even with the extras came to just over 100 pounds return for 2 people return. Flights on time aircraft very clean check-in at both airports very efficient. Airline food on way out OK but way back actually very good for an airline hot meal (roast chicken and thai green curry options for the return flight). Euro low cost carriers could learn a lot from the service and pricing model of their Asian counterparts. Only minor gripe is the lack of use of airbridge except departing Don Muang and wait for luggage on return flight.,0
"Kolkata to Hyderabad. It is the best domestic airline in India with best prices and the most punctual one. It is seldom late so I have never been in problem due to late arrivals as I mostly travel in late night flights. Food is basically paid one but I have never tried anytime. They consist of mainly ready to eat meals like cup-noodles, biriyani, sandwiches.",0
Terrible customer service! I showed up to my flight two hours before boarding only to be told my flight was cancelled. The was no notification of this via email or text. I understand that flights get cancelled so I remained calm and polite. I asked for a refund so I could afford to go and buy another ticket at a different airline only to be told it would take at least 5 days to get my refund! I had to settle for rebooking my flight for the next day. They even refused to pay for my parking at the airport. As someone who works in customer service I know terrible people skills when I see them. Rude and unsympathetic team members and terrible policies.,1
Air Asia Indonesia CGK-DPS. Convenient and fast. Booking process is smooth and check-in just needs a QR code and the scanner at the airport. Staff are friendly young and vibrant. I only recommend short (5 hour max) trips with them. It's a point to point carrier and not one you should use for long distance.,0
"First pro is their web site very easy and no hidden costs the spring up as you progress into the booking process. Aircraft mostly new and clean with friendly staff. Flight service is limited seat pitch 28"" for coach and 32 for business. Very tight however was on request was given a long leg seat with a smile and no charge.",0
Purchased sale fairs to Japan from Sydney to Tokyo via Cairns. A330 is far better then the single body A320 as the seats recline further and are wider. Seats are comfortable and roomy. Paid food and good and tasty while the paid entertainment is a bit scarce in options. All flights were on time.,0
My wife and I flew Melbourne to Christchurch on Sunday May 4th JQ 171 Airbus 320. Left Melbourne on time arrived 10 minutes early. Plane clean good attendants nothing to complain about. Will fly Jetstar again in November Auckland to Christchurch.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Tawau. Air Asia is a low cost airlines, but their ticket is not always low cost, tickets expensive especially the festival period. But I will still choose Air Asia as my primary airline because it is cheaper compare to another airlines. The experience to fly with Air Asia is not so good when the flight is more than 2 hours because of their bad design of seats.",0
First flights with Jetstar. JQ29 MEL-BKK and JQ30 BKK-MEL. Both flights comfortable and enjoyable by current discount airline standards. The only negative a 50 minute delay boarding (MEL) but the flight then arrived at destination early so it mattered little. Seat comfort good food good service good and attentive and IFE good. Business class with a discount airline is of course really the equivalent of premium economy with a full service airline. I can't speak for those travelling economy but can't see the justification in complaints about lack of extras when the customer chose the most inexpensive options not to pay for them. You get what you pay for.,0
"Cebu Pacifics mismanagement cost me  21.5 hours and approximately 200$. I had taken a return ticket from Bali to Dubai via Manila. (Pointers to keep in mind if youre booking) - Initially the flights were such, Bali- Philippines (2.5 hours halt) - UAE. They cancelled that and gave us a halt at Philippines for 18 hours. - Initially when we asked at our check in counter in Bali about this they said, sorry we cannot do anything as Cebu pacific doesnt have any office or personal there. - There was no easy way to get in touch with them that, we even tried the Facebook messenger which was completely managed by the bot and not helpful at all. - Once we arrived at the Philippines airport, the staff of Cebu pacific had made us wait at the transfer desk for almost 1.5 hours and then they just left to hide from the other passengers in distress. - As per the immigration rules many passengers couldnt exit and were stuck in the airport for 18 hours. - They tried offering us compensation after repeated complaining from our end, After making us wait for 2 hours additional We could see it was a ruse as they offered us 3 hotels. Out of which two of them were 2 star hotel and one of them was a 2.5 star and extremely far from the airport. Crisis management was extremely weak, we were given statements such as you took the flight from Bali to Philippines , that means you accepted our conditions , You can take your own hotel , You can post whatever you like etc. in short, they did not care about the passengers concerns, wellbeing or comfort they just wanted to do escape from the situation.",1
"I think this is the best budget airline in south east Asia. The cabin crew was nice, ground handling is fast, good online check in platform, good customer service. I got no delay when I go to KL but when i back to Jakarta, I got delay around a hour but its ok. The seat is so so, food was good, no inflight entertainment. The ticket from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur round trip is $30 cheaper than any domestic flight in Indonesia.",0
SIN-DPS-SIN on 737-900ER. Latest entrant on the 'prized' route and had to take advantage of low fares not available for past two years. Single class cabin seats rather hard but typical of such carriers slight recline snack box and free drinks provided. Returning flight at 12am was delayed for 2 hours ground staff provided mini dinner snack box which most passengers left untouched. Delay was informed upon check in. Cabin crew pleasant call button answered almost immediately drinks requests tended to quickly. The major difference between Lion and the rest of the budget carriers is that they do not hawk duty free sales so once meal service is completed passengers are left undisturbed. Both flights not completely full despite the very attractive fares. One reason could be due to the bad publicity Indonesian carriers have been receiving. Extremely value-for-money service something we should not take for granted in these times.,1
"Horrible. Cebu overbooked the flight, so they canceled my flight to Manila, and offered to rebook me two days after the fact. I wouldve missed my connecting flight.  they did not inform me of the cancellation. I discovered it accidentally. Decided to dump them all together, cancel the ticket, and went with AirAsia , which is much more reliable. Cebu charged me a rebooking fee. This, by far, was the worst airline.",1
"Melbourne to Sunshine Coast. Pathetic all round. Flight cancelled, dismal instruction, online portal poor, employees were totally useless. Constant incorrect or inaccurate notifications via text or email. Huge queues, promised alternative flights but then reneged on that, feel for the elderly and families with young children. Could be dealt with so much better, just be straight with people, stop shaving costs and treating people like cattle. Will never use the company again, ever.",1
Manila to Busuanga with Cebu Pacific. Twin prop aircraft. Massive delays. Poor communucation not telling customers about delay or how long. Flights eventually cancelled. This airline is really poor. I wouldn't recommend Cebu Pacific. Will pay a little more for less stress and to know I will get where I need to at the time I need to. Seat comfort in the end was woeful.,1
"Hyderabad to Rajahmundry. The staff in both locations was very pleasant and helpful. They went out of their way to accomodate me. I left my laptop and phone in the security check line because I got distracted by all the rigorous questions asked by the security personnel and my stuff got separated from my bags they were checking, so I did not realize I did not put the laptop and phone back in my bag. On the plane I finally realized and we started calling the lost and found at the airport in Hyderabad. They were closed because it was Sunday. In Rajahmundry we spoke with IndiGo personnel and the airport manager who helped me get hold of someone from the airline in Hyderabad and assure me that my articles are secure with them. They even offered to send my stuff via a next available flight but I was coming back the next day, so I was just willing to pick it up then. In Hyderabad staff were very pleasant and helpful and quickly gave me my articles after checking my identity. Someone from Indigo actually went to the security, got my stuff and kept it at the counter. Everyone went above and beyond and I quickly got everything back but knowing that my stuff was safe waiting for me on a Sunday night was very reassuring and stress relieving. Thank you, IndiGo staff. I am not familiar with airlines in India but I would recommend them to anyone who is traveling within the country.",0
Terrible service. Dirty airplane. Avoid at all cost: especially if youre travelling with a toddler/baby. Air stewardess was extremely intolerant towards toddlers/babies. Stewardess was extremely annoyed and spoke sarcastically to me when she saw my child playing with the safety booklet. Definitely better budget airlines in the market which tolerates young children.,1
Flew Scoot flight TZ7 from Perth to Singapore on 23/06/14. The aircraft was Goin'Scootin the crew were very fast to serve food and were very friendly. The captain however made announcements far too softly. We did not choose our seats and got super seats for free which have more legroom compared to the blue seats. However the seat was not cushioned and was quite hard the flight was quite bumpy so we did not feel relaxed at all. The food served onboard was very expensive but was needed for a 5hr flight. The boarding at Perth was terrible no queues staff not trained.,0
"Hobart to Melbourne. This was a very smooth flight. Check-in was fast and efficient, as was boarding (including checking for overweight cabin baggage). The seat was a little tight, but fine for a short flight. The plane operated on time and the onboard welcome was friendly. Luggage appeared on the carousel in good time. All in all, a pleasant experience.",0
Seat 30e and 30d Last line seat of the aircraft. Space for the legs is around 6cm smaller then the others seats lines. The backrest is hard as a wood table and is not even possible to flip it down a bit. I think its the worst aircraft seat Ive seen. Please stay away from this terrible company.,1
Had the worst travel experience with Jetstar. The trip over from Brisbane to Honolulu was ok but upon coming home I received an email at 11.42pm saying that our flight was delayed. After ringing them I was told that it would be leaving two days later at 12.45am. I was put up in the airport hotel and given USD 30.00 for meals. The following night I was given a note under my door saying to get to the airport at 12.00am so assumed again that our flight was delayed again. Yes it was it wasn't leaving until 3.00am! When ringing Jetstar and going onto their website I was told that it was still leaving at 12.45am and again the website said that as well. Many frustrated and angry customers we all proceeded to the airport. No one at Jetstar knew what was going on and after waiting for over an hour a non Jetstar customer service lady proceeded to tell us that it wasn't leaving until 3.00am. Apart from her not one Jetstar representative agent came to talk to anyone on the flight. Where is the customer service?,1
"Terrible experience. Firstly, the initial ""low"" prices are a loss leader only. Once you pay for the ability to change or cancel your ticket it's more expensive than SIA business! (Unfortunately we needed a direct flight and Jetstar was our only option). Flight postponed a few hours with email notification. Later postponed again with no notification (found out from our relatives who checked their status page for us). Went from leaving at 9.30pm to 12.30am to 5.30am (check in at 2.30am). So we booked a hotel and rushed to the airport so we could check in so early the next day. Flight cancelled just as we checked into the airport hotel. They refunded the hotel, but there is no compensation for stress, running around, etc. of course. We changed to the flight leaving 9.30pm next day and fortunately this one took off. But late, and not before 90 minutes standing in check-in line (despite being early) because they only had one economy checkin counter open. Staff is abrasive, curt, unfriendly, both on the ground and in-flight. At the other end the wait for our bags was over an hour. My advice - if you travel with Jetstar you're doing it at your own risk. I would advise anyone to take a longer route to get to their destination by choosing any other airline. Jetstar's only redeeming feature is that their economy seats are more comfortable than Emirates economy seats.",1
OOL-IN in Economy having traveled with Scoot on four previous occasions. Boeing 777 is comfortable clean and has enough overhead storage. Economy seat is sufficient and comparable to other low cost carriers. Food was not purchased as I prefer to eat before and after a flight on LCC. Drink prices are reasonable. Staff were very attentive friendly and were on the go for duration of the flight.,0
"Malang to Jakarta. Absolutely appalling.We booked tickets that said they came with checked baggage, yet when we looked the day before flying it said no bags. Pre-paid bags can only be paid earlier than 6 hours prior to the flight. Impossible to purchase online within 48 hours of the flight. Clearly we were not able to go to the airport the day before our flight to pay a slightly cheaper price for our bags. The worst part is they charge by kg, so our heavy bags cost us about 800k rupiah (~$80) at the airport. The staff understood nothing and looked almost smug taking our cash (oh yeah, they only accept cash). Completely shady and unprofessional.",1
Jakarta - Manado. I would try avoid travelling with Lion Air if I could. Luckily my flight was on time. Flight attendants were not friendly at all. It was a bit like a market up there when they were selling food and as they didn't really control how many cabin bags you can take they were hardly any space to put my one bag in the cabin.,1
Padang-Jakarta sector - airline seems more like a shuttle. No food was provided  but the ubiquitous water cup which you get on every public transport in Indonesia.,1
The flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad was delayed by 2.30 hours in the night. Scheduled departure was at 10.40 pm and actual departure is 12.50 pm. This was my second worst experience within a fortnight period with IndiGo. They just give the reason of technical glitch and no alternate arrangements are there.,1
"Horrible. Always huge delays, no customer service. Worth paying a little more for an alternative airline (not batik or super air jet as they are the same group and just as bad).",1
"Sydney to Phuket. Absolutely disgusting service and communication - my flight back to Sydney was canceled at 2 pm for a night flight at 10.05 pm the same day. Impossible to talk to anyone only through ""let's chat"". As quick as starting a ""Lets Chat"" conversation I was told my only option was to take a refund which can take up to 7 Business Days to refund which is ridiculous considering you take the money from my account instantly. I have now been desperately trying to find another flight home along with the other 300 or so passengers I'm sure! Never again Jetstar, I refuse to use your way below average service again. Even AirAsia do a better job!",1
Appalling. Unreliable. Outward flight delayed. Plane not clean. Rubbish lolly wrappers under seat in front. Return flight cancellation announced on almost indecipherable loudspeaker only 10 mins before boarding time then flashed up on screen at Boarding Gate. Such late notice (none received by SMS) left many stranded and those with already checked in baggage unable to transfer to another airline in time. We were forced to sit at airport an additional 4 hours to be seated on their next plane. Staff claimed Captain had called in sick. Surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in. To cap it off purported staff shortage on arrival at Tullamarine meant a further delay as cabin crew unable to open doors to allow already disgruntled passengers to disembark. No apologies. Not even an offer of a complimentary tea coffee or water in flight for those affected. Very bad PR. Don't try to speak to Senior Management about your experience or have them contact you - Jetstar claim they have no direct line. First and last time we travel with this airline. Booked through Qantas who code share. Have travelled other Qantas code share internationally on several occasions and never had an issue. Jetstar is low budget low everything. Never again never.,1
"For my first flight with Scoot I decided to stick with a standard seat, and it was pretty decent, certainly more comfortable than most full service airlines. The brand new 787 aircraft was bright and clean, and the flight departed on time and arrived a few minutes early. Inflight wifi was said to be available - but at USD12 for 1 hour I didn't verify. Food was a let-down though - they promote that vegetarian meals are available, but on this flight they were not - not a single hot vegetarian meal available for purchase (unless you could mushroom pot noodles, which I don't). In fact despite a generous menu, only 2 hot meal choices were actually available. I could understand this if the aircraft was on its return leg, but we departed their home port of Singapore for goodness sake.",0
"Brisbane to Melbourne. Just like everyone else on here. Voucher for 840$, can't use it. If you even bother to read this in Jetstar HQ, you have ripped me off. Never again you only got a 1 out of ten because I cant give you zero.",1
On my AirAsia trip from Kuala Lumpur to Busan my plane was delayed due to weather. I had to spend many hours in the airport but it was ok because of the excellent customer service provided by staff. She was extremely helpful and kind. I am very grateful to her for making my long delay much better.,0
"Delhi to Istanbul. Plane seemed old (1.3 years old), seats were uncomfortable. They'd run out of veggie sandwiches before they got to me, so I agreed to get noodles instead., these were instant noodles, but took it anyway. No in-flight entertainment or alcohol served. At the end of the flight we had to seat on the landed plane for about 15-20 minutes with no explanation given and then while exiting we were given some form to fill in on the spot (but no pens to fill it in with). One plus was that the staff at Delhi airport were quite nice and the ones on the plane were fine as well.",1
"Singapore to Penang. Cheap flights but the seats are narrow and the pitch is not great for long distance flights. Only 29 inches pitch means you will struggle to sit comfortably if you are above average height. Front row (Row 1) seats and Exit Rows 12 and 14 have more leg room but no under seat storage in front of you and overhead lockers can be limited. If you book the front rows of seats (Rows 1 - 5, 12 & 14) at an extra cost you do get priority boarding so can manage to get luggage overhead. Service is good, on time departure if the flight arrives on time, you can book food at an extra cost but only a 1h 20m flight so not really needed.",0
"Flew with them SYD-SIN one year ago the legroom for economy was very good the best within the LCCs however I just recently flew with them again and it is a recently configured plane from an old used SQ plane and I realize that the seat pitch is about 1/2 to 1 inch smaller. With more planes their departure and arrival times have improved a lot. Service is average they tried the ""no outside food"" rule on me just ignore them and have your own food. Note their arrival time to SIN is about 8pm at night so you probably need a night in SIN if you book onward flights consider that cost when compared to flying direct with full service airline.",1
"We travelled Biz class from Sydney to Singapore then the next day to Bangkok. The schedule suited us exactly as it allowed us overnight in Singapore to catch up with friends. The flight left on time but due to strong head winds we arrived in Singapore a little bit late.  Biz class is good value especially if you buy on promo and we were glad to have  the extra leg room for that 8 hour flight. We booked aisle seats in the middle, so got an empty seat between us. Plenty of room to move about. We had the upgraded meals That was worth the extra compared to the normal meals we saw served. Scoot offers a free drink of your choice as part of the meal. Water was available free any time. We took our snacks onboard and there wasn't a mention from any staff about that. Then again, the snacks made no mess. We used Scoot in style at Singapore airport. Incidentally we used Krisflyer points to get a Scoot voucher and used the voucher to pay the  Scoot in Style upgrade after making our booking. You need to do all that on the website beforehand. It worked perfectly. So we arrived at check-in 3 hours ahead of the Bangkok flight and got about 2 full hours in the SATS lounge. It was worth it as you can eat and drink a lot during 2 hours! The Bangkok flight was pretty full as it was a public holiday, but Biz class was ok. Again we were offered any drink to go with our upgraded meal.  We got a seat between us empty. It was a good quality experience, I'd do it again any time. Behind us was the quiet cabin with no children. That looked good too.",0
"My class of service is scootplus. I booked a return trip that is ScootPlus, and due to circumstances, I had to fly back immediately, that is the next day after I reach Melbourne. When I booked the ticket, they mentioned ""One-time free date change"", but when I try to change it charge me over $500 for an economy seat. I then proceed to make a new booking, that is a one-way trip, from Melbourne to Singapore, and cost me around $500. When I am at the Melbourne airport, they asked me to look for the Singapore Service centre, which means I need to fly back right? But when I am back in Singapore, all service centres were all closed and there was absolutely no one there to assist me. Mind you, I seat an 8 hours economy flight and it was already 3am in the morning in Singapore. Now that I called the service centre, they are telling me I cannot get my refund back.  This is totally ridiculous. I have already downgraded myself to a seat at the squeezy area, with no service at all, and I am charged close to a $500 for that, in addition, and on top of my ScootPlus booking that cost $1400.",1
I want to take this opportunity to thank the Captain & cabin crew of 6E7475 CCU to IXR and all Indigo team. Last evening i have border 6E 7475 from CCU to IXR the flight was good till it reaches Ranchi before landing we faced gusty weather with heavy rains and winds the pilot was unable to land we touched down the air strip and again fly back then we fly back to CCU then around 11:20 pm the team decides to again reattempt the landing around 12:50 am in Ranchi but again we could not land due to poor visibility.  We again fly back to Kolkata. They provided me a 4 star accommodation along with food and arrange a car for pick up and drop. They have also reschedule the flight for the next day. I want to thank the team.,0
TAC-MNL (5J-654). Delayed almost 20 minutes due to bad weather cond. Good seats friendly flight attendants food and drinks served for a fee.,0
"Bangkok to Krabi. Don't bother flying with AirAsia. Sent me a text saying they have changed my flight time. They didn't bother sending an email with any more details to resolve it. When I spoke to their customer services they refused to help - they have a policy that if they have changed the flight time to within 3 hours of the original time they won't offer a refund. Not great when you picked a specific flight time to suit you - i.e. after a tour has finished/leaving enough time to check into the hotel. Means I have to pay for another flight with another airline, I might as well have thrown my money in the bin.",1
Jakarta - Singapore on Friday on the 17.30 using the Red Carpet service was an enjoyable experience. Check-in was prompt and efficient and the lounge used basic but comfortable. One issue is that I had to pay for a beer which was poor as it's included in KL. A very efficient member of staff took my passport away and processed it with immigration which was good. I was accompanied through to the Departure Lounge and even accompanied across the tarmac before everyone else. Aircraft clean and comfortable and cabin crew very professional. Visited Air Asia in Changi re. complaint from my SIN-CGK flight in Red Carpet without lounge access offered in Changi - it'll be interesting to see if I ever get a reply or refund!,0
Booked a connecting flight with them from Singapore to Bali 4 months ago. Today they cancelled it and moved us to a flight that departs 4 hours before we land in Singapore. They suggest we fly the next day but do not want to fund a hotel and we do not want to lose a day of our holiday. Have had to cancel and switch to another airline at considerably higher cost. Could only talk to a BOT.,1
"Did not let me remove luggage. Took huge amount of money. Advice: Pay a little more and choose another airline. I booked an extra 30 kg luggage with them. My hand bag which on no other flight was weighed, was like 2 kg's more and they charged an exorbitant amount and threatened me that they will not let me board if I remove the 2 kg's from my luggage now. At that price I could have taken Singapore Airlines which includes meals and has excellent legroom.",1
"Auckland to New Plymouth with Jetstar. If you want to have a hassle free experience, do not book Jetstar. I have been on multiple flights with Jetstar - as I am a student I always go with the cheapest option because I simply cannot afford to pay other fares. Every Jetstar flight I have travelled on to or from New Plymouth has been delayed with minimal warning. This morning I had a 6am flight that was cancelled, however, because I know of the unreliability of this airline, I made sure and checked the website, app and my email prior to leaving which said the flight was on schedule. I found out when I arrived at the airport that the flight was cancelled due to ""crewing requirements"", I asked when was this flight cancelled? and Jetstar said at 3am. I did not get an email until 5am stating the cancellation, a time in which I had already left for the airport. Jetstar offered a bus service down to New Plymouth or a flight the following day, which is completely worthless to me as I needed to be in New Plymouth by 7am. So instead I asked for a refund which is going to take 2 weeks to receive. I do not recommend this airline - the cheaper fare is not worth the hassle that will end up costing you more.",1
"Extremely unpleasant flight with Cebu Pacific from Manila to Sydney. Check-in lines slow and staff rude. We were not told we could not bring a water bottle onto the flight. We bought one after security but it was taken at the gate. Cebu Pacific should have informed us. Seats with no lumber support and no cushion, had to pay up to $30 AUD for a blanket. Advertising across the cabin. Was kept on the tarmac for an hour and a half so the air-con could be tested. It was turned off and we all sat in the heat for a good twenty minutes before they turned it on again. Drinks and food way too expensive. One small water bottle was about $4 AUD, but because our water had been taken at the gate we had to take it. Food was served cold and not tasty at all, despite the $10 price tag for one little bread roll. Could not pay by card; only cash. Attendants rude and obnoxious when I gave them the wrong cash by accident in a currency I did not understand. Toilet not cleaned for most the flight; suspicious water over the floor. No IFE.",1
Cebu to Singapore. All went smoothly at check in. On entering plane I mentioned it was my friends birthday. The cabin crew could not have been more friendly or helpful. I had hoped for a quick mention but they organised a game which resulted in all passengers singing happy birthday. They were wonderful.,0
"Bangalore to Mangalore. Extremely poor service. Three tickets were booked and were given scattered seats. One of the passenger is a 5yr old. I just have one question, are you guys that stupid to not understand that a child would need the company of one of the parents? When I asked the staff for assistance all they had to say is to try to convince any of the passengers to move. Great help. To me, this is a disastrous experience.",1
"Singapore to Manila. First time and last time flying with this aircraft. Value of money not worth it, yes its cheaper compared to other budget airline but end up spending more because of the delayed flight and the reason is their is a technical issue on the plane that can not resolved. Flight delayed from 12:55 am to 3:30 am. With those people who have connecting flight not advisable to take this aircraft. The worst customer service. Flight delayed and nobody offered us a drink, ground staff at Singapore said those with connecting flight someone will assist us (delay team), upon arrival to Philippines, flight stewardess said we can approach the ground staff at the counter for assistance, ground staff not helpful as no instruction from them from Singapore and staff told me to call their office. No feedback form, no apologies even after I told one of the staff I missed my connecting flight although I paid 2x more for the rebooking of the ticket what makes me upset is I need to wait it the next day for the next flight.",1
I flew with Indigo in August 2012. Given the hype about this airline I thought of giving them a try and they didn't disappoint. Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge. However there isn't much space between the seats and does feel a little cramped.,0
"I took the KUL-SUB flight on 02 December 2016. We departed later than scheduled, 25 minutes to be exact. The flight was almost full. There was no pre-departure announcement by the captain. The seat that was bought by me was initially taken up by somebody else as the person wanted to sit in a group. The stewardess was able to settle the dispute amicably. The flight was smooth most of the time. Landing was okay.",0
"Sydney to Honolulu flying later in April 2019. Giving great marks for Ted the agent I talked to on the phone, he was amazing and super funny, he cracked me up. Great in helping with extra baggage.",0
"Indigo, largest Indian operator and a budget carrier. no additional features like IFE or meal but decent service. no issues flying domestic, mostly on time, clean and fresh interior, courteous crew, value for money.",0
Flew JQ944 from Melbourne to Cairns then onto Osaka (JQ15 Business class) then Osaka to Fukuoka the next day. Returned on 6th January Fukuoka to Osaka (GK550) then Osaka to Cairns (JQ16 Business Class) Cairns to Melbourne (JQ947). The Japanese legs were fine as was the outbound flights to Japan. Though the return flight from Osaka was average. They forgot my sons meal during dinner service (I had to ask them for it) they did apologise though he ordered chicken and got beef and I said nothing as I figured it was all to much trouble for them. Then the girl going through the cabin offering desert tea and coffee missed us completely. Once again I had to ask. The fight from Cairns started good with a very helpful girl at the counter. Some of the crew were terrible. Then a rather rude women on the crew ordering people to sit down marching up and down the plane and the two crew members sitting down the back during the whole trip gossiping in loud voices. As an Australian it was embarrassing. As a regular flyer I've got to say the service is pretty average and it really is hit or miss. Some staff members are very good while some are woeful. But I guess you pay for what you get.,1
DPS-CGK-DPS. Both legs using new Boeing 737-900 ER. Departed on-time even early. Cabin was clean. No more free drink. All foods and drinks are for purchase. Seat pitch quite tight. Overall I was satisfied flying on Lion Air.,1
"I booked this flight on August and AirAsia cancelled it so I had to reschedule. Then when finally came the travel time and I arrived at 7am at the Jakarta station, they told me that the flight to Medan has been rescheduled again this morning for 6pm so around 9 hours later. This was already bad because I booked a trip in Medan so I couldn't make it on time. And I didn't even receive any email or notification about rescheduling. Then around 3pm I got another email saying that the flight has been rescheduled for 1am of the next day. 5 min later I got another message saying the flight has been rescheduled for 1:50am. So 4 times rescheduled, together 16 hours of delay. They gave us ridiculously low amount of money as an excuse. When I started to think about a refund and I tried to book another flight at the same day with another company, AirAsia said that I won't get any refund because I rejected it. Which I did not, they told me about the refund and I said that I have to think about it.",1
My return flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore both delayed and rescheduled without proper reason. It significant trouble passengers. When you suppose to touch down at 11pm but at last you end up reaching at your destination 2 hour later than original. All the time cost and travel cost nobody is going to compensate you. Have heard a lot of comment that Scoot delays without reason and I choose not to believe at the first place since there might be a exception. But end up I becoming one of the victim.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Phuket delayed arrival of 45 minutes. I used this airline for the first time, with 4 flights in January and every flight was delayed, the one from Bali to Kuala Lumpur was a 3 hour delay. Rubbish time keeping.",1
OOL-NRT Business 14 Sept 2014 seats 1A/C. Dreamliner. Flight was on time departing leaving mid morning. Flight attendants were attentive friendly and professional drinks offered before take-off orders taken for lunch and drinks. The seats in Row 1 are definitely the most comfortable with no one in front reclining and plenty of legroom. The lunch was delicious my wild mushroom arancini were as good as any I've tasted. I had a glass of Royal Chivers and the attendant made sure it was topped up necessitating an afternoon nana nap! A late afternoon snack of warm beef foccacia sandwich before getting into Tokyo was also excellent. Only gripe is the footrests are low and on the night return flight I would prefer the legs more elevated. However value for money one can't complain. I'll save time here and say the return flight on Sept 24 was also very good the meal not so good but a reasonable standard.,0
Bangkok - Macau return 20th Sep return on 22nd. Excellent flight for low budget airline choose the first row in plane priority boarding. Only problem was the 20 minutes delay with no explanations.,0
Having flown many times with AirAsia we are really amused by some of the critical comments about this airline. Having flown dozens of times in SE Asia and might we add that we always fly Business Class for our long haul with another airline we find Air Asia short flights excellent. If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin. They are punctual good value food wed upgrade our luggage and seat when you book and crew are always pleasant. Petty comments about no entertainment on a 1 or 2 hour flight takes some beating. As with Ryanair follow their rules and you will have no problems.,0
"Udaipur to Dubai via Delhi. I was travelling with my spouse, mother and infant. Udaipur - Delhi flight was delayed more than 2.5 hours and because of this I missed my Delhi - Dubai flight. No one from IndiGo was there to assist, I struggled for 5 hours at Delhi airport with my kid, they made me run between the counters. After struggle of whole night they arranged to fly in another flight but only for two people, I had to travel with my kid and mother leaving my spouse at Delhi airport. They arranged a flight for my spouse after 12 hours.",1
Morning Departure from Mumbai. There was a snaking queue at check -in but the staff were very prompt and I got my boarding pass in 10 mins. Clean aircraft and push back 5 mins ahead of schedule. Landed in Chennai 15 minutes ahead of scheduled time. Good value for money.,0
Our flight was scheduled to leave from Manila to Caticlan (Boracay) on January 8 2015 at 2.35pm. First no announcements were made until past departure time. Once the announcements finally came they merely mentioned as a side note that our flight was canceled and that we should proceed to the counter for rebooking. After waiting in line for another half hour they booked us on a 5:30 PM flight which however will only leave at 8pm because (as usual) other delays. This flight was now going to Kalibo which is another 2 hour bus travel away from Caticlan. That flight was delayed AGAIN and departed only at 9.30pm. We landed in Kalibo at 10.30pm and arrived at our hotel at around 1am. All other airlines left on time so it definitely wasn't an issue with the Airport.,1
Flight to Hong Kong was delayed by 1 hour. Check in was easy. Boarding was unorganized. Plane was clean. Seats were ok. Recline was adequate for a 4 hour flight. Food was good. Toilet was clean. Cabin crew was extremely friendly . Flight arrived 1 hour late. Just a magazine as entertainment. Return flight was delayed by 20/30 minutes. Plane was clean. The Nasi Lemak was good. Plane arrived 10 minutes late.,0
"As always I had a great experience flying IndiGo. It was a quick one day trip from Lucknow to Goa and also my first in over a year since the pandemic. I was very impressed with the ground and cabin staff ensuring all the passengers maintained social distancing while boarding and in the cabin during flight. Before boarding all passengers were given a Safety Kit packet which included a face shield,face mask and 5-6 pouches of hand Sanitizers, also the best thing was that all the middle seat passengers were also made to wear the safety gown along with the face mask and face shield which is a good safety measure. The inflight magazine wasn't available but understandable as they are trying to minimize the contact as much as possible. Water bottles were free of cost even though pre-covid IndiGo used to serve water in cups but it's nice they are serving water bottles free of cost and also in addition to that they are served free tea and coffee as well. Snacks and hot food items were available for sale, however, I had pre booked my Food item while making the booking and it was served in IndiGo branded pack and sealed and tasted as good as it looked. The flight did depart 5 minutes behind schedule but I won't mind 5 minutes given IndiGo sanitizers their aircrafts before and after every flight so I'd rather depart late than departing unsure of the safety. Overall an amazing flight experience with IndiGo. Great Price, Great Safety and Great legroom and Tasty Inflight Food!",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Bali. My flight supposed to arrive at 23:45, on 31 march they changed it to 12:55am on 1 April and offer a chance to change my flight time within the same date. So I called the customer support and moved it to 10:45am, which took me almost 45 minutes to finish the phone call. It wouldn't bother me until they told me my flight would delay to 14:35 on 30 March. I called to confirm and they told my flight was still the same time. As soon as I arrived KUL airport, I found my flight delayed to 14:35, then I asked them to move my flight to the 12:00 one, they refused my ask cause I didn't change it 48 hours ago according their policy. They changed my flight within 48 hours and ask me to make a change before 48 hours?! The woman in the counter was unwilling to face the sentences stated in the email that If the new flight is inconvenient to you, please contact our Customer Support for either one of the following options: 1. Change your flight to another time/date within 14 calendar days from the original departure date or rquest for a credit account of the value of your booking which is to be redeemed within 90 calendar days from the issuance date for your future travel with us or equest for a full refund of the value of your booking. She said she can call her supervisor but the answer would still be the same. After the call, she said although my supervisor still not agree, I can change your flight. So booking airasia can save a little money but waste time.",1
"Kuwait to Sydney via Manila. The staff was friendly but service was slow. The food was horrible, didn't have any flavour at all. On the second flight it was barely warm. Never pre-order meals from this airline - bring your own food. Even the ice tea/juice that came with the meal was undrinkable. Like water with a cup of sugar. There was no entertainment and drinks or any food aren't included to the ticket price. You have to pay even for water. If you had bad luck and end up flying with this company, bring your own blanket. Surprisingly there is none in the plane and it is cold there.",1
"Perth to Melbourne. Poor customer service would never fly this airline again. The staff is rude and not helpful in any way possible. My two daughters and I flew to Melbourne but got stopped on the way with our hand luggage and was told it weighed over because the included my purse and I was made to pay $90 to a staff member who thought he was top of the food chain. For budget flights, I would rather fly Tigerair.",1
"Surabaya to Jayapura via Makassar. Flight left Surabaya one hour late - nothing unusual for Lion Air. Transfer in Makassar went smoothly and we arrived in Jayapura just that one hour late. Apart from the delay, it was a smooth flight, typical no-frills Lion style.",0
Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. A really nice and comfortable flight. I've also noticed that AirAsia arrives earlier or on-time despite being delayed for half an hour. The cabin crew was really friendly. Thus this shuts all my negative views towards them before. I would fly with AirAsia again.,0
BNE-TSV in A320 September 2013. Flight up on JQ906 was good - delay caused by passengers made up in air service efficient seat pitch and width adequate for a quick flight. 5 hours before departure we received a text message and email informing that the return flight had been cancelled - called Jetstar customer service and were put on to a slightly later QF and were given a $200 voucher for future Jetstar travel. Very happy with Jetstar customer service - particularly as the tickets were super cheap sale fares on a low cost carrier.,0
"Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. I arrived at the Gate 4 at the Kuching International Airport at 9.20 this morning (12 Sept 2019) for the 9.30  Kuching-KL flight, but the push-back for the plane had already taken place. The ground crew gave me an excuse as to why the plane departed 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Consequently, I had to purchase a later flight (10.50 Kuching-KL flight) at a cost of RM349. If the plane in actuality departs 10 minutes earlier, then the Airline should state inform passengers that the flight was scheduled at 9.20, not 9.30 am.",1
"Doha to Kathmandu via Delhi. The staff in Doha assisted me very well but when I arrived in Delhi, was when the terrible experience started. After we got off from the flight, passenger with an onward journey to KTM were asked to just wait at the arrival gate exit without any explanation of why we have to wait and for how long we have to wait. We were held for about 20 minutes without enough seat there. At KTM airport, check-in was fairly nonchalant, again no smiles. And then the ground staff did a hurried security check for restricted items at the aircraft stairs which has been done already after emigration or they could have been done before we board the bus. The staff is asking the passengers to open our bags.",1
"Yogyakarta to Jakarta. Everything is okay, the legroom may be limited for people with height more 175 cm. If you want more spacious legroom buy emergency seat. Free baggage 15 kg for Indonesia domestic flight. Overall okay, especially as they have various pre-order meal with reasonable price (same with fast food price).",0
Singapore to Guangzhou. My first Scoot flight. Not bad to be honest. I had a meal and suitcase included in my ticket. Food did not look great but was hot and very tasty. Cabin crew attentive and friendly. New clean aircraft. Seats not too comfortable but leg room surprisingly good. No IFE for this low cost carrier. For a short haul flight of under 4 hours Scoot was acceptable. It is not like its big sister and there is a difference but if price is your bottom line then Scoot may be just the ticket!,0
"Indigo using domestic flights in international routes. Even after paying good amount, uncomfortable seats, no screen, no charging points, service staff rude to me. Announcement done in such a weird way. Lights were disturbing even in a overnight flight.",1
Flew from Poona to Calcutta and then a connection again IndiGo to Bangkok. Both flights virtually flawless. Have to always commend the cabin crew on their providing a comfortable flight. Noticed something new this time: on deplaning one of the cockpit staff emerges to join the cabin crew in bidding adieu. I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?,0
"HKG-SIN on July 13 2012. Almost four hour delay. Seats cramped no inflight entertainment. I paid for checked in luggage seat selection and even food. For the price I paid for a meal I got two drinks and a plastic box of heated junk. I expected a tray like a normal airline meal. With all the add ons it was no longer ""low fare"". Value was non-existent. We had to take the bus at the terminal to the far end of the airport. Since many people don't want to pay for checked-in luggage overhead bins overflowed. By the time we got into the cabin it was past the time for taking off. I have a roundtrip ticket and I dread using the return portion from Singapore to HKG and go through another 4 hours of sheer misery and utter discomfort.",1
"My flight in February was delayed for 5 hours. It was a morning flight and they sent an email during midnight 3am telling me that flight been changed to noon. But when I was in airport the flight was further delayed for another hour. I boarded and the plane went on circling for another 1 hour. Flight attendees were rude to me. Scoot gave me a $30 voucher during the flight delay probably the only slight saving grace however, the staff at the counter was just playing her phone texting. Zero regards about customer service or much known to the delay. I bought the wifi, it was not even working despite trying countless times, it was not an entirely cheap flight either like those promotion deals, got it at $250+",1
Sydney to Singapore. We had seats 21 DEFG which are the bulk head row seats which we found very good. We had plenty of legroom but bear in mind that the armrest are fixed. Seats on the day flight over were fine coming home on the night flight they were not very comfortable for sleeping quite tight and don't recline far but didn't expect much. The food was awful I wouldn't bother pre-purchasing just bring some snacks. The service was friendly but a little slow. For a LCC I found them really good and for less than half the price really great value. We departed and landed on time had no real issues with anything I would use them again but would certainly aim to get the bulk head row again or at least the super seats - normal seats looked really uncomfortable.,0
"Cebu to Siargao. Worst airlines I have experienced.  First time our flight has been canceled and I dont see any returned money yet. Because of this we had to go to our destination through ship during 9 hours. The second time we were late only for 2 minutes and they didnt pass us to the plane, so we had to buy new double-priced tickets!  I dont recommend this airline!",1
"In my opinion, Scoot is one of the best low-cost carriers in SE Asia. Little sister to Singapore Airlines, they deliver a diluted version of a five-star airline to the budget-conscious traveller. The seats are just fine, and the legroom is better than on most budget airlines. Definitely my airline of choice in SE Asia.",0
"Honolulu to Sydney. Worst airline experience I've ever had, and I fly a lot. The savings will not be worth it, pay more and book with another airline. I never write reviews but my experience with Jetstar has been so unbelievably bad, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. They sold me a ticket and never delivered on the flight. They told me to buy my own place to stay in Hawaii for two nights while they tried to find a plane that could actually fly. Mind you, this was in perfect weather, the cancelation was because of ""Engineering requirements"" whatever that means. They never reimbursed me for the non existent fight, nor the room in Hawaii they told me to book, at the last minute. When I called to try to get my money back they treated me as if I did something wrong, like I missed the flight or something. They were incredibly rude when it was entirely their fault.  I asked to speak to a manager, I was denied, I asked for my money back, I was denied.",1
"Bangkok to Singapore on 9 June and Singapore to Bangkok on 18 June. Both flights with Scoot departed on time. Check-in at the counter in DMK had about 20-25 passengers in the queue at about 2 hours before departure. The queue moved quickly. Similar experience with check-in at SIN. Kudos to Scoot for having sufficient counters to handle check-in traffic. A quick glance at nearby counters for other carriers including full-service carriers tell a different tale; long queues of 80 passengers or more is common. The flight from BKK to SIN originated from Japan with a stopover in BKK. The flight from BKK to SIN continues to Japan. This being a B787-8, the cabin feels spacious and clean. Cabin crew provided clear announcements in English. Announcements were also made in Japanese. Cabin crew was friendly and had constant presence in the cabin. They were fastidious with safety checks before departure and arrival. What impressed me was the seats which had good recline comparable with full service carriers and the sufficient space in the overhead cabins despite the flights being full. Seats at other LCCs covering this route could barely recline.",0
"Flew Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia are cheap, but that's all they have going for them. The experience I have with them is as follows: Deceptive - they add lots of charges and it's hard to navigate their online system to avoid the extra fees. Website crashes - as said above, their site is 'tricky' to navigate. I think it's deliberate, to trick you into buying extras you don't want and to gain revenue from inadvertent double bookings of flights. Customer service - there is none of this at AirAsia. None. Ziltch. I asked for help and they arrogantly didn't listen, instead just threw 'policy' or 'rules' at me. There is no compassion, no fairness, nothing. Just everything their way. They won't even provide an escalation process if unhappy with their ruling. Unfair and unjust. Small seating - the seats are too small for taller people. I hate that. I will never book an Air Asia ticket again. Instead, I'll go Scoot or Jetstar - these companies have a heart and actually care about service.",1
"Singapore to Perth with Scoot on 15th November was one of the best flights I have done. Plane and seats were great, staff were great, meal was good. Would not hesitate to fly with them again - the only issue I had was not understanding the wifi, that was my fault. Scoot is a good budget airline.",0
IndiGo airlines are just like a road way bus. One can say like a khatara bus. So much of noise while take off. No smooth flying like Vistara. Seats are not comfortable. Very poor services. Very bad attitude of its staff. They are charging for everything but not giving anything to its customers. Ridiculous airlines.,1
"Indigo is best on time operator in India and this time too flew on time. Check in was smooth, took total 10-12 min, boarding started on time and also departed on time. Cabin was clean and fresh, no food booked or bought at aircraft so cant comment. Toilets were clean. Cabin crew were courteous. Only con is seats, as a LCC not very comfortable but ok for 2-3 hr flights. Reach Ahmedabad on time, so overall good experience.",0
"Brisbane to Melbourne. Never before have I been asked to weigh my carry on at the gate. Never before have I been told that my handbag weight counts towards my carry on luggage bag weight. I understand that I was over the permitted weight of 7kg when both items were weighed together, but I was disgusted by the fact this has never been required before and I had to pay a $65 fee to board my flight. I chose Jetstar because it is a safe, reliable and economical option. When you whack on a $65 fee, this makes Jetstar just as expensive as competitors. I will seriously consider flying with Qantas or Virgin next time as I know I won't be hit with unexpected fees. These carriers are more expensive because they offer food and in-flight entertainment. Jetstar does not. I opted for the more affordable carrier to keep costs down. Imagine my surprise at the gate when I had to cough up another $65! All I had in my carry on was a laptop, an outfit for work, pjs and a pair of stilettos. It's laughable that I can ""wear"" everything on, but I'm charged if I'm ""carrying"" it. What a joke!",1
"Ridiculous airline company and completely amateur. My booking was cancelled twice due to Covid 19 which is fair, but I was forced to keep changing and paying extra money to change my booking on the available date. Long story short, the price of the ticket was originally $400 and now I have paid a total of $1660 only for changing my flights - no refund policy available as they force you to accept their dates.",1
"First of all I understand that AirAsia is a low fare airline but doesnt mean that whatever that this airline managements doing is right where I flew in this airline so many times and never flew on the time of they advertised initially when purchasing the ticket. We purchase the tickets suits our occasions but what happen always are rescheduling the flight, over delay and frequently change gates. Due to delay and rescheduling, I cant attend my event. At least for not disappointing please provide some complimentary drinks for making your customers to wait for so long. Please be responsible on the schedule that advertising initially. After all this is low fare airline not free airline so please respect your customers time since we are purchasing tickets too. This is not fair at all where if we as a customer if late for few minutes, will the airline wait for us, no right, so again Im telling that please respect your customers time.",0
"Singapore to Manila and Cebu Pacific is typical budget airline with narrow legroom and packed planes. Well, you get what you pay for and yes, it is affordable. As single male passenger flying without luggage I convinced the check in staff to get me an emergency row seat, which has far better legroom, so it was good. Service was ok, timely departure, on time arrival.",0
Brisbane to Denpasar. First time flying Jetstar internationally and first time on the Boeing 787. Have flown Jetstar within Australia for a pleasant experience and found the crew friendly and obliging. Did not enjoy flying Jetstar internationally. The difference in service and seating between the two is like chalk and cheese. I am 186cm and booked the exit row with seat 23C. Cost was $45 for the exit row which in my view is very acceptable. Plenty of leg room but seat is narrow with hardly any padding. Seat was very uncomfortable. Booked the bundle which included a meal which was a cold chicken type rice salad. Worst meal I have had on an airline. Crew were not friendly and appeared disinterested. Once they gave the meals out (which was early in the flight) hardly saw them again. For a six hour flight would have been happy to pay for a bottle of water but you do not see them to do so. Loved Bali and can not wait to go back but not with Jetstar!,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta delayed by 2hrs 50 mins. This is my last flight them. If you have connecting flight this airline will get you in trouble. This airline seems to attract people attracted to low price and fly point to point only, where long wait in the terminal and extensive delays does not matter.",1
"Singapore to Perth. Pay the extra $100 and fly with another airline. It's not worth the cheap fares at all! I was misinformed by their customer representative on my baggage allowance and then charged an absurd amount of $400 at the airport to check my bag all due to their misinformation! No one gets back to me when I call the hotline or send an email requesting a refund. Honestly, just save yourself the frustration and pay a little extra so you don't have to deal with the mess that is this airline.",1
"I cannot say enough good things about Zipair. First and foremost is the excellent price for a round trip ticket from LA to Tokyo. With the current exchange rate you can go Business class for under $2,000 R/T, or for under $900 if you fly economy. This is with all the upgrades added. You will spend a little more on snacks and drinks, but that is even cheap with our current exchange rates. The seats are all comfortable and their internet is free. I would recommend downloading some shows prior to take off as the internet did drop a couple of times.",0
"The cabin crew was friendly and helpful. But if you're a tall person don't expect the legroom to be great. I am 5'10 and I wasn't even able to stretch my legs. If you do fly with Jetstar just expect: No inflight entertainment (Unless you're flying the Boeing 787), barely any legroom, my knees were against the seat in front of me. Food can be a bit expensive is recommended you bring your own food. Isn't too bad if you're flying around for 1 hour. Your flying on a lowcost airline don't expect to much",1
Melbourne to Newcastle. My 8pm flight was cancelled without providing sufficient explanation. They refused to give me a flight the following morning. I had to fly into Sydney airport 2.5 hours drive away. This level of service is unacceptable.,1
Worst experience ever. Our flight was delayed at check-in. No reason given. No information on how we will be accommodated when we miss our connecting flight. Staff were terrible. My flight experience was terrible.,1
"Horrible experience from Cebu Pacific. We knew we would have excess baggage weight prior to our departure so I tried calling them and logging in online to purchase additional weight allowance however their phone does not seem to work, their website doesn't recognize the booking reference we have. Come day of departure we were charged enormous amount per kilo. Seems like we are meant to deal with the problem directly to the ticketing counter on the day of departure so they can charge more.",1
"Gold Coast to Manila via Singapore. Booked early to have it all sorted and quick flight. They changed the flight with 24hr stopover, then we can't change flight, so asked for money back. They will only give part back taking 300 dollars of our money now, they are doing it again for other flight.",1
"All went quickly and even before time! We were almost late checking our bag, they packed the plane and we landed ahead of time. Cannot complain because it is rare that airlines run their operations ahead of time. No service but we knew about it so no complaints. Point A to point B, all went well. The pilot was very nice informing us when Kota Kinabalu will pop on the horizon, so we were ready and got some great photos of the beautiful mountain. Weather cooperated as well. Thank you and we will fly with you again.",0
"I found flying on a Boeing 787 on Scoot is very similar to full service airlines in terms of seat width and legroom. Cabin crew were friendly. Love the cabin lighting and relaxing ambience. Toilets are kept clean throughout the flight. Brought my own neck pillow, a bottle of water and a sandwich. Scoot offer great value.",0
"Manila to Bacolod. Flew all the way from Houston,TX to get here and a few hrs before my flight find out its been cancelled. Missed my speaking engagement. My trip was completely ruined. Over $2000 of travel expenses that I was not compensated for because I wasnt able to make it to Bacolod in time. No reasons and no apologies.",1
MNL-KULh. Booked online from Australia with no problems. Seating somewhat cramped but OK for 3.5hr flight. Service onboard OK but not as friendly or /professional as Air Asia. Only paid A$90 so good value. Only problem was arriving at KUL LCC at 1am so stayed at Tune Hotel at LCC - very handy and cheap.,0
"Singapore to Ipoh. This flight was like taking an express bus coach. I've given Scoot a poor review flying 10 hrs from a non home country origin. This time the experience was completely different. Arriving at Changi airport and immediately greeted by a well dressed lady who offered to help me check in. What! Help me check in to Scoot? I declined as I knew what I was doing, so I went to the Scoot area and there were 4 counters open and nobody in the queue. Immediately checked in with no hassle, very helpful lady. Looks like I bought my ""board me first"" for nothing. At the gate, everything was squeaky clean. Boarding was by row and not by ""board me first"". Still, no problem. Very friendly crew, and departed on time, landed early after 1 hour, bags all. Very well behaved passengers too. But no service was needed, no service was offered, no service need reviewing. Like boarding a bus and getting off. In summary for a short flight esp if you fly from Changi, Scoot does not appear to be a budget airline. Warning, fly Scoot from another country and over a long distance, you will notice the difference!",0
I travelled from Istanbul to Delhi by Indigo airlines 6E12 on 23/10/2023 along with my wife . The flight was horrible with very little leg space. The air hostesses did not care for the passengers and they did not care to offer water also. I would strongly advise people not to choose Indigo. Very bad experience to me and to my wife.,1
"Sydney to Honolulu. They charged me $300 to take my carryon, claiming it was too big. I saw others that went through with similar sized, but they said they had to be backpack sized. If too heavy, u kinda understand but not for $300!  To top it off the agent was rude and I heard other agents complaining about customers that had questions. My flight was bout 9 hrs long and all I got was half a cup of water offered to me. Everything else I had to pay for.  None of their movies, music or games were free either. So in the end the flight cost wasn't cheap at all. For $8 a movie, I could buy the DVDs to keep! Never flying with them again and I advise to pay a little extra for better services and meals on flights.",1
"Flew economy class (Blue seats) on scoot flight TZ8 from SIN to PER on 16/06/14 and found them nice enough. You might realise that the blue seats are actually cleaner than the yellow seats which have stains. Pilots were very experienced and Scoot was actually a new airline so we were surprised that there was actually Senior first officers. Service from the ""Scootees"" were actually quite fast but they serve food rather slowly. Their English was actually quite nice but sounds unusual. Flight was very smooth and will fly Scoot again in the near future.",0
"Singapore to Sydney with Scoot. Flight delayed by 6 hours. No notification from Scoot. Given a $10 food voucher as compensation, not even entry to the lounge as a business class passenger. No ground staff from Scoot itself in Singapore airport. Offered to be put in economy on flight to Melbourne and then no compensation for finding my way to Sydney. The incoming flight was supposed to leave Qingdao at 3.10pm and arrive at Changi at 8:50pm. They had stupid amounts of time to call or email to notify us of the delay. No reason given as to why they did not email or phone to notify. Food on the way to Singapore was terrible and service is quite average. They give you your meal in the first hour so for the next 7 to 8 hours you have to pay for everything else. Beware.",1
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was retimed to 2hrs later and the airline informed me less than 24hours before, which was too late to make other arrangements. I tried contacting the airline via live chat and twitter as they don't have a call centre. After hours trying to reach the live chat agent, I was told they could not do anything for me. Then I contacted them via Twitter and they informed me that I can opt for an earlier flight which was 2hrs earlier than my flight and I have to be put on standby at the airport, without any guarantee that I can fly then. I end up flying at 2050hrs instead of the original 1835hrs departure. Arrived at the airport and checked in. The agent informed me that they will compensate the delay by providing meals which was just average. Boarding was quick. The flight was parked at a remote stand, and were transported by a bus. Once onboard, the crew apologised for the delay many times and we very polite. The sale of inflight meals and snacks was done professionally with a wide range of hot meals and snacks at affordable prices. The flight was uneventful and before arrival, the crew bowed and thanked us for flying with them.",0
"I read the reviews online only after booking with Scoot and I was very worried after seeing so many negative reviews. However, I had a very smooth, comfortable flight with no problems. The aircraft was new, spacious and clean. The staff were a little blunt but not rude. I paid for the Nasi Lemak and it was good and also came with a water and chocolate. As someone who always flies with LCCs Im used to being treated poorly while flying but this was a really pleasant experience. I would 100% fly with them again!",0
Flew them between Brisbane - Sydney and Sydney - Gold Coast. Clean aircraft on-time departure. Cabin crew were quite mechanical in their duties. Food items and beverages were available for sale. Their web-site is also quiet user friendly for making reservations. Overall good experience.,0
"Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. I booked a hire car through the AirAsia website which upon selecting the car diverts you to cartrawler.com - I received a congratulations for booking email and an updated itinerary with hire car noted. 45 mins prior to departure I received another email starting a hire car cannot be provided, I attempted to book another prior to boarding but was unsuccessful so figured Id just get one on arrival- this was unachievable at KLIA 2 as no office wanted the hassle an hour prior to closing. After an hour of phoning 24 hour hire car companies I gave up, which meant the Hotel that was booked and paid for in JB was not used and unable to be refunded and the trip planned to Legoland with my 5, 7 and 10 year old sons was now canceled. Shame on you AirAsia and your inefficient car hire partner  - you spoiled the highlight of our school holiday adventure",1
"Phuket to Sydney. Poor airline, its not all that much cheaper. I chose to fly with them as they are an Australian company, you have to pay for all your services that are normally included on all other long haul flights, even baggage! The main problem flying with these guys after all those extra costs is delayed flights, Ive flown 2 international flights and 1 domestic and all have them had been delayed. So disappointing",1
"I first bought the upgrade pass in 2015 via Air Asia site and I purchased 6 upgrades to business class for more than the amount if you go directly to optiontown and request a non guaranteed upgrade but I thought the guaranteed one was worth the extra money. I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money. On the pass they only give you useless 'credits' which you will never use in the limited time period.",1
"Worst airline Ive ever flown with. I waited over 2 hours on gate K6 for departure however an announcement was made that the plane was delayed over 1 hour which I then waited patiently. 10 minutes before 5pm departure time I get an email stating plane departing from different gate which I headed to and missed the plane with my family and kids. I was then advised to go to level 3 and speak to AirAsia customer service to explain to them and they immediately requested that I pay 870RM as this is a special deal. All I can say is this airline is a total scam, stay away. I did rebook with AirAsia as now they were the only airline flying to Langkawi at 08:55pm however this time the plane was delayed 2.5 hours. Never again!",1
"Yogyakarta to Kuala Lumpur. First time with AirAsia and it was quite satisfactory. Waited in line for about 20 minutes at Jogja to check in, but the line moved fairly quickly. My hand luggage was over 7kg so I bought extra baggage allowance, but the ground staff at Jogja never weighed my hand luggage. Boarding started at departure time so we got off the group 30 minutes late, but we arrived on time at KUL. Crew was attentive. Seats were reasonably comfortable. Announcements were frequent and easy to understand. Overall I was satisfied with this AirAsia flight.",0
"Singapore to Berlin. 13 hours long flight, no free water, no free food, no free pillow or blanket, no free entertainment system. Cabin crew. didn't speak English to me, and spent most of the time hidden in back part of aircraft. It's not worth it save of the money.",1
Flights were in and out of Manila to Kalibo and also to Legazpi. While the prices are cheap and staff friendly the whole experience was a pain. Firstly the check-in at Manila is terrible. The queue seems to take forever as the staff are very slow which is not surprising as the admin and ticketing process they have is ridiculous. Multiple pieces of paper stapled together when just a boarding pass would suffice. At Manila expect to wait in line for at least an hour for check-in even if you are early. Every flight we took was at least an hour delayed this caused issues with our connections at the other end. The delays just seem to be a natural occurrence to Cebu Pacific which is probably why they offer no apology when they finally get round to notifying you of the delay. Once on board you can expect to wait quite a long time for the plane to actually leave as the runway traffic is very heavy at Manila.,1
"I've been flying Jakarta-Manila-Jakarta route for many times since last year (2016) with Cebu Pacific as they are the only budget airline that flies directly on that route. In general, all my flights were a pleasant experience. Often times the Jakarta-Manila leg is on time. When it gets delayed, it's usually due to long boarding process (around 15-30 minutes) because passengers need to be moved by a shuttle bus from gate to the aircraft. Meanwhile, the Manila-Jakarta leg lately was always on time. It's worth noting though that both flight schedule are considered off-peak hours of the airports. Cabin crew service are so-so. Some were nice, welcoming, but also some were not. Though, I am usually not expecting too much from a low-cost airline. When it comes to food, so far, I've only tried their Beef Tapa and Chicken Tocino. Nothing special honestly, and in fact it is overpriced. The serving is too small for it's price tag. The only good thing is that they accept payments in multiple currencies: PHP, USD, and IDR. Lastly, their A320s look well maintained. In the inside the cabin looks clean, smells good, and is cold. Leg room is bad, so I always try to get the seat in emergency exit row where generous leg room is available.",0
"Always terrible without a hint of apology. Always delayed all the time I fly with this airline. Boarding time per boarding pass is 6.40pm - its now 7.15pm, still nothing.",1
Another horrible experience. Last year I experienced a 4 hour delay in Melbourne on my return trip to Sydney which they blamed initially on mechanical trouble and a further plethora of excuses which I just tolerated at the time. Yesterday October 13th 2014 I copped another dose of Jetstars incompetence and attitude to its passengers. Supposed flying JQ413 at3pm to Sydney - arrived at 2pm. At 2.30pm an announcement made that the flight was cancelled (with no explanation) and that we were to be bussed 100km to Brisbane to join JQ817 to Sydney which didn't depart until 6.30pm. So instead of being home in Sydney at 5.30 pm we got there at 9.20 pm 4 hours late. Totally unacceptable. They don't provide proper service to their customers and as far as Im concerned I will never fly Jetstar again.,1
"A good experience. Its largest Indian airline and with best On time performance. Boarding was swift, aircraft was clean and fresh. It was a late night flight. Departed before time and reached Mumbai before time too. Cabin crew was courteous ,no IFE option, seats are just okay. Overall good experience",0
"Kolkata to Delhi. I have been in India for few months and travelled with Indigo few times, and I have always had a lovely experience until today. Ive arrived to Kolkata. As I went to drop my bag at the check-in desk, a barrier was lower, so I took a shortcut and stepped over it. Straight after staff come up to me and with a intimidating attitude asked me: is everything ok?! At first I didnt realise, but then I told me in that I should not step over the barrier as a matter of security. Honestly I felt very embarrassed, so I apologies. Few seconds after I saw some older guy doing it, but staff looked away. Then another guy did it in front of him, and staff smiled away. So I asked staff why it was ok for some people to do it and not for me? It was then become aggressive and rude, so I decide to let the argument go. He should be fair with all, no just pick arguments with foreigners so that he can feel good and embarrassing customer in front of all. I hope Indigo can address this with staff and provide him with a customer service training. He is the face of Indigo when people arrive at the airport, and people like him can ruin the reputation of Indigo. Then on the flight they didnt have changed for cash payments and instead wanted me to buy more things. That was pathetic, they offer a service they should make sure they have changed, it was the first flight in the morning and I was seating 1st row and they didnt have changes.",1
"All the flight attendants performed their tasks with enthusiasm and energy. I must make special mention of the senior cabin official, he was superb. No problem was too much. His energy and smile was infectious, the best service I have experienced on a flight",0
"Waiting for more than six hours in Cairns airport being told we could not leave unless we were back before 12.45 even though the aircraft boarded, then cancelled several times prior to the 4 pm departure. Jetstar informed me that I had agreed to this by agreeing to pay for their flight. So money does not provide a service, only a suggestion of a service. Do not trust this airline, they are a dubious business run for money without the service paid for. Very disappointed.",1
I've just had another bad experience with this airline and I will never travel Jetstar again. This trip the flight I was departing on has been cancelled and I was offered a flight approximately 4 hours earlier. Since this was not possible due to other commitments and anything offered resulted in me missing the event I was travelling for I asked for a refund. The staff member informed me this was only available for the departure and they could not refund the return sector. A return flight isn't much good when you cant get there! Terrible customer service and I won't be caught again!,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Krabi. Despite that AirAsia have the Value Pack consists of baggage allowance and meals for additional price, the website settings require both passengers to take this package and could not be edited to only one of us. It's a short haul flight, full of passengers, but handled well by the ground staff and cabin crew. For those bringing checked-in luggage, use a padlock to avoid any missing items.",0
Our first and definitely last ever flight with Jetstar. I write this as I spend over 12 hours at Changi Airport after Jetstar cancelled a flight from Singapore to Perth supposedly due to bad weather in Perth. There is no bad weather in Perth today and other airlines are flying there. We and our fellow passengers believe they have given this excuse to avoid responsibility for passenger accommodation. For this reason we simply will not trust them again. We were warned though so the lesson has been learnt.,1
"Booked Lion Air for a trip to Jakarta from Singapore. Reached the check in counter at Singapore just 40 mins before flight departure and the counter staff told me that the check in timing for the flight has closed. The staff wasn't friendly and offer no other assistance for me. To other travelers, do consider Lion Air to be your last option, should you not have your trip ruined before you even leave the country.",1
"Taipei to Singapore. My scheduled flight was 2.05 pm and we reached the check-in counter at 1.10pm and  were told that check-in closes at 1.05pm (an hour before flight). The customer service kept saying to buy a new ticket.  It was just a 5 mins difference and we had to purchase a new flight ticket. I find this really ridiculous as the airline had a policy of check-in closed an hour before flight. This policy does not reflect in the scoot app. The policy only reflects on the invoice sent via to email. When I asked if they had seats left for the next upcoming flight, they told me to purchase the ticket online. This 5 mins later cost me $375SGD per person. When I sent an email regarding about this issue, they did not address to my question or provide a solution. Their reply: We refer to your feedback received on 19 January 2018 through our Customer Support Portal. As part of our efforts to maintain on-time flight departure, we adhere closely to our check-in counter closure times. Our check-in counters open 3 hours before departure time and closes at 1 hour prior to scheduled departure. We note your feedback on our airport check-in staff/handling. This will be shared with the relevant airport teams for their review for us to further improve our services. Nevertheless, passengers who showed up after the check-in counter closure time will not be accepted for the flight and our tickets are non-refundable in nature.",1
"Sixth flight on Jetstar and every time it has been delayed. Jetstar has no customer service, you ask their people a question and they look at you as if you are wasting their time. I am going to pay a bit more and go with Air NZ at least I will be able to get there on time. Their hospitality on board is outstanding. Jetstar crew look depressed and stressed. Go figure.",1
"When comparing prices, they are deceptive in not clearly showing what all the add on costs could be. They have a shocking web site page whereby to add a seat, food and checked baggage would keep dropping information from the checkout. I had to book singularly for the meal and seat allocation. I could not find costs on baggage as their search details kept telling me they do not fly out of Thailand (only sell seats for such). I could not add the checked baggage option and nor could a friend trying for me in another country. It took hours to try and complete everything and was incredibly frustrating. They do not provide an easy working web site to manage your bookings. They had a chat function, but that was useless for trying to get any help, it was more an automated add on service marketing tool only. Overall experience. I will never use this air service again. $120 Australian dollars paid for check in baggage when the web site had it for around $48. When comparing prices, many other carriers allow 30kg checked baggage. Jetstar are not really comparable on a pricing basis because they charge for anything they can without full disclosure on the compare sites.",1
"Indore to Delhi. Staff at airport are pretty rude, I had 1 check-in luggage and no hand luggage. My check-in luggage weight was 16.7kg. That lady was asking me to pay and when I said that I am not carrying any hand luggage still they said you can take out stuff and carry on hand luggage. I have been traveling with IndiGo for 7 years, they are getting worse and not value for money.",1
"AirAsia offer four flights a day to Singapore from Bali Indonesia. Unfortunately it is difficult to rely on any flight time as they have started consolidating flights to fill planes. My booking for the earliest flight was to allow time to take my daughter to Singapore for her 21st birthday. First flight in, last flight out would give us 12 hours in singapore. 2 days before the flight to Singapore AirAsia resheduled it, ok fair enough, it was only by 2 hours. But then 6 hours before the flight they rescheduled it again by 3 hours. Then to add insult to injury the rescheduled flight was also delayed by 50 minutes. We finally got to Singapore but our entire whole day shopping trip turned into only 3 hours. Why offer such an extensive array of flights you have no intention to fulfil? AirAsia have lost all credibility",1
"Manila to Legaspi, November 1. It was a 45-minutes smooth flight which left MNL on-time and arrived at LGP slightly ahead of schedule. Cebu pacific allows maximum of 40 kilos checked baggage on purchase per passenger. However, if you have more than that to check in you may purchase their 15 kilos ""sport equipment"" which is fair enough for its price. I have to commend the lady at the counter for helping me check in an item which was not allowed by the boarding gate security. All in all it was excellent flight and was able to take some pictures of the beautiful evening skies.",0
I have flown Jetstar for a while now and to be honest you get what you pay for. Gold Coast to Tokyo was great staff good seats fine in star class. Manila to Singapore - no star class on that flight but paid the extra for legroom.,0
"Have flown Jetstar Business international on many occasions and the crew has always been energetic, engaging and very pleasant. On this flight from Melbourne to Singapore though the crew were robotic, devoid of personality and as much as I hate to say it, soulless. At one stage a FA came past and tapped her index finger on the arm rest where the tray table is stowed to indicate for us to get the tray out, I guess speaking would be too much to ask for! Would fly Jetstar again but hope to get a crew with personality.",0
Flew Kolkata-Bangalore via Chennai. Flight departed on time the aircraft despite being one of their older ones was clean and well-maintained. The crew were simply superb. Though the catering onboard should improve. The variety is very restricted. We made an early arrival at Bangalore despite a late arrival in Chennai. Will fly them again.,0
"After repeatedly trying to do an online web check we couldn't. We reached the airport, asked the staff to help us out since we were running out of time.. The lady at the counter said you have to do it on our own. It was just not happening. Finally she tells us the portal is closed so need to pay for the tickets. Next we asked for tags to lock our bags. That was unavailable and she tells us.",1
"Terrible airline, changed our flights twice and then got to the gate and told us our flight had been delayed 6 hours because they hadnt checked the engine/engine faults. Also charged me $65 for being less than a kg overweight and charges $4 for a plain tea on the plane.",1
Depending on whether the flight is full or not your experience on Scoot will change dramatically. On a full flight you will experience the worst most uncomfortable seat in an aircraft. When the passenger in front of you decides to sleep and put their seat down low its back will be directly in front of your face. Thin seats extremely narrow not recommended for medium-long hauls.,1
Mumbai to Jaipur. I am a frequent flyer on this particular route. I prefer a low-cost flight on this route as the journey time is just 2 hrs. IndiGo is not a full-service carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an IndiGo flight be sure that you reach on time. They have a record of on time departures. The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good. The meals served are ready to cook meals and some snacks also available with good range of beverages.,0
"Singapore to Athens. Lost my luggage, asked for more money to check me in and worst service ever. It's been already 5 days that I arrived and I'm still waiting for my luggage. I had 2 check in luggage, the first arrived one day later but still awaiting the second. When I went to check in at Singapore they made me pay 21 SGD saying that my e-ticket was not confirmed, even though I had received the confirmation and was never contacted from them. The crew wouldn't allow people to spread so as to get more comfy saying that if you want to change seat you have to pay extra. I'm definitely not flying with them again.",1
"We flew Air Asia twice during our trip to SE Asia. I found the process of check-in well organized and tolerable. A low cost airline is going to have large crowds to manage and they did a good job. The seats are tight but no worse than more expensive airlines. Ads are tedious but I am sure these keep the cost down. All in all a satisfactory experience. They got us where we wanted to go efficiently and on schedule. Isn't that what a ""Now everybody can fly"" airline supposed to do?",0
"Nov 8 2013 BKK-SIN-SYD on ""scoot-thru"" Biz fare carry-on only. Originally advised of 1 hour delay which blew out to 2 hours with air-bridge problem at BKK and change of gate - not Scoot's fault. Departed at 10pm instead of 8.05pm. Biz section half full bulk head seats offer less leg room so moved to aisle seat further back. Seat not very comfortable less so then Premium economy on full-service airlines. Couldn't sleep much. Service friendly but minimal. Had to queue in SIN for SYD boarding pass. Why can't they supply both passes at origin? Just a money earner I think though no charge on the Biz fare. Offered water on boarding in SIN and asked if I'd like a drink. Opted for a beer which never appeared until breakfast time! Drinks on Scoot are apparently served with meals only. Flew Emirates Bus class 2 weeks prior - from the sublime to the ridiculous! AirAsia Premium a much better product though considerably more expensive.",1
Flew from Don Muang Bangkok to Jakarta. Planes clean and new flights were on time crew indifferent seats narrow. However considering the price a very good alternative especially in Bangkok where you can enjoy the now (almost) empty Don Muang Airport with no queues at the immigration and fast luggage deliveries.,0
"Horrible to no service. Delayed for 5 hours and customer service basically said there's no obligation for them to be on time, no apologies, justification first. By purchasing a ticket, the customers signed an agreement that delays are no responsibility of Jetstar, they have no obligations to be accountable, it's bad luck for customers.",1
"I booked a ticket on Indigo on 03 Jan 22 for 05 Jan 22 Cochin to Dubai at departure time 00.30 local time but after the booking I get an SMS stating the departure time on 05 Jan 22 is 13.00 local time which is a delay of almost 13 hours and do not serve my purpose for the day. Their website had a problem then why should I suffer for it, hence I requested a full refund for which they are not willing to give. I called them and after talking to their customer service for 01 hour or more, she would not give a full refund, neither solve the issue nor let me speak to her manager and wanted me to book for another date. From her I understood that the 04 Jan 22 flight was cancelled and they rescheduled the 05 Jan 22 flight, which I did not want due to the change in timing and fly with another airline as I have to reach on 05 Jan 22 early morning. These guys go by On Time departure and Arrival but none of that is true. So all of you be beware and customer service has a few lines which they repeat for every question and it really annoys you as this is not the right reply in English for a question asked. Pathetic situation to cheat you out of your money as when you cancel they get a free amount of INR 5,500/-. Disgrace to this company and the people who work for it and own it. Really cheap strategy.",1
"I got covid while visiting my brother for a wedding in Arizona. When I tried to reschedule my flight they refused, stating they would refund me the tax in 2 months time. I now have to spend another $500 for a new ticket on top of the $320 total for PCR tests.",1
"My sister, niece and mother were traveling by Indigo flight. I had booked wheelchair assistance and it was mentioned that the wheelchair assistance was in waiting list. When they reached the airport it was mentioned no wheel chair assistance would be provided. They reached the airport close to 3 hrs in advance. The front desk did not even help with other paid assistance wheelchairs. They simply ignored my sister's requests. Departure was at gate 85, later it was changed to Gate 35 at last minute Again my mother had to walk such long distance without any assistance from the airline crew. At least the crew could have guided the family to a paid wheel chair assistance at Mumbai airport.",1
"Hong Kong to Puerto Princesa. In the check-in desk they haven't accepted confirmed return ticket and forced to buy me another one in the last moment. When i wanted to write a paper that i will arrange my return flight by my self they didn't allowed me to do it. In summary they scam me for 100 euro, even they tickets cost 60 euro online. And i this money i lost because i already have a ticket. So i think this company is scam passengers for buying return ticket in the last moment and their staff are very rude in Hong kong. It cost me so much nervous and 100 euro extra. I think it's their policy how to sell more tickets. I feeling most terrible now after such a flight and have extremely negative opinion about this airlines",1
"Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram. This is the worst airlines In the world, they are liars and they are careless. If your health/mind/luggage is important to you I do not suggest to ever travel with them. They lost my luggage, they did not refund the money for the cancelled flight and they were lying to me that they found my luggage just to mislead me and make me go away. I hate this airline. They hurt me emotionally and physically, 3 days spent at the airport just looking for a bag. I booked another flight and they told me my bag will be loaded. When I was boarding they said my bag isnt there and no one knows where is it. They are the worst in the world. And if youre thinking ah theyre cheaper then others thats ok - it's wrong. Thats what I was thinking and trust me its not worst the experience I had with them. Dont fly with IndiGo.",1
"Melbourne to Manila. This airline is not worth it. You have to buy everything, even a blanket. We been delayed for 7 hrs for stupid reasons, there is no onboard entertainment. The plane is a 1 year old A330-300 with a poor seat.",1
"This was an evening flight. I was worried the flight might be delayed when taking-off or landing (because DMK and CGK packed with passengers!) However we landed 30mins ahead of schedule! The pilots were able to take off and landed the aircraft smoothly with little turbulence. This time I ordered Chicken Teriyaki (pre-book) and it is good. Rice and chicken not dry, well seasoned.",0
I flew JQ4 today from Honolulu to Sydney and the flight crew were fantastic. There was an ill passenger on the plane and the cabin crew did everything to help him. They had medical staff check him before the flight and looked after him through out the flight. The service on the plane was excellent. Jetstar is a low cost carrier and is a lot cheaper than other airlines so yes you pay for extras. I read a lot of people whining about extra costs. Do you not understand that is why the airfare is cheap. If you want the additional benefits at no charge fly a full service airline. I flown on many airlines and really found Jetstar to be great value. They were on time and the cabin staff were pleasant. Keep up the good work Jetstar!,0
"You can't check-in until 2hrs before flight. But you must check in at least 1/2 hr before - no exceptions - or then you lose your ticket. This means check-in counter staff are idle until each flight opens - then bombarded - by the people who are all waiting just outside the check in queue anyway. They usually don't use air- bridges so you have to walk in the weather across the tarmac. You kind of expect that on a little Dash-8 at a regional airport - but not on a big jet in a capital city. As per Jetstar website seat pitch on the A320 is 28"" - not 30"". All other Aussie airlines have 30-33"". That makes a big difference on a 5.2hr flight BNE-PER. Seats only recline about 4 degrees back as a result. You can't even get a drink of water for less than $3.50. No room in overhead lockers because they're full of carry-on luggage from those who won't pay $18 for checked luggage - but will happily pay for numerous $7 bourbons en-route. You can't move to spare seats because they are sold to someone. The worst aspect: You can't check your bags through on multiple domestic flights (only on some international). You have to get your bags after each flight and then re-check for the next flight and re-clear security. A pain when there's 5 hrs between flights (remember - can't check in until 2hrs before) but worse if your flights are close & first flight is late. For inflight entertainment you do have the option of paying $10 for an iPad but these are limited.",1
Singapore to Gold Coast. First of all flight was late almost 2 hours. I paid extra to have a seat by the window to have a better sleep. Seat was broken that I couldn't let it down. Asked to put me to sit somewhere else. They said no available seats only if I pay extra to sit in quiet zone or extra leg room. They gave me broken seat what i paid extra already and refused to give me other seat. It would not cost anything to company if they would put me to sit somewhere else.  I wrote to them and it took like a month to respond and all they said was oops sorry we will fix the seat. Like how's that going to help me? Never ever fly with them again!,1
"We had visa problems with Vietnam entry visa. The Air Asia staff , particularly Naruemon were extremely helpful in resolving the visa issue. This included making phone calls to Vietnam and assisting us with a new visa application online. Thank you very much for very helpful and friendly staff at Don Mueang airport.",0
Perth to Brisbane. Flight cancelled after waiting in the airplane from midnight to 3.30am. Rescheduled for the following day and new delay. Attendants tired and not offering support.,1
"Sydney to Singapore. We flew Scoot Airlines Scoot Plus cabin. This used to be called Scoot Biz but they changed it because of too many complaints that it was nowhere near business class. It is really a Premium Economy product at a budget price. You also get designated check in, priority boarding and disembarkation. There are negative reviews of the Scoot Biz or Scoot Plus product. You get what you pay for. The ticket price if you are doing a return trip is not much more than economy on full service airlines and much less than any premium economy tickets. The seats are fabulous, 20 inches wide with 38 inches leg room and 6 inches recline just like most premium economy airlines. However, you need to bring your own entertainment or device and can purchase extra wi-fi. You get one meal and drink on this 7 hour flight. Sadly, the food is not great. This is the downside. It is what we would call TV dinner standard and portion size. You can bring your own snacks, no problem but have to purchase their drinks. Overall, highly recommended over any economy or premium economy product, except for the food.",0
"The flight from Jakarta to Berau was a mixed bag. The leg from Jakarta to Balikpapan was flown on a B737-900 on Lion Air, which was pretty much on time though the flight was not very comfortable with very limited leg space. However the flight from Balikpapan to Berau was delayed by almost 4 hours which was really irritating since the flight kept getting pushed by an hour at a time. They did give each passenger a compensation of 300,000 for the delay but which did not cover the fact that I had to shell out extra for a hotel room in Tanjung Batu since the connecting boat to Derawan was missed. The flight as such was ok but the next time would prefer to fly Sriwijaya or Garuda despite paying a slight premium.",1
"We will not fly with Jetstar again. At Perth airport on June 4th there was some sort of alarm telling wardens to report to their stations which ran for about 30 minutes, at no time did Jetstar staff make an announcement saying everything is okay, sorry that your flight is now delayed. There was some mumbled apology from pilot but overall we got 3 different reasons for all delays. Return flight 12th June - No notice received by us or our friends (who were not booked all together) that our 7.30 am flight was delayed until 4.40 pm - there was a message from 10.30 pm the night before which we got on landing in Australia. We had chosen email as preferred mode of contact as we did not have mobile access in Bali, but no email received to date. When we got to the airport our flight was the only one with no boarding gate listed for a couple of hours until about 30 minutes before flight, we watched the plane landing then we got a gate. Again we were delayed with no reasons given and got back to Australia at about 9.30 pm. There was no hot food available on the flight except noodles! I am sure they will have excuses but not communicating with us at any time is poor practice and many on the flight had same complaints and said never again on Jetstar.",1
SIN-MLA-SIN. Check-in at SG budget terminal chaotic ground staff kept moving us between counters. Flight was delayed and it took 2 hrs to clear immigration in Manila. Return to SG was delayed 1 hr boarding gate kept changing. This airline has a habit of cancelling and delaying flights. Internet rates are sometimes more expensive than full-service airlines.,1
Flew first time with them from Manila to Hong Kong. Price was cheaper than competitor. Fight was 4.40 pm and it left 5 minutes early however due to heavy traffic flight didn't take off until 30 mins late. Bought food at time of booking. Hot food not so good but it was cheap. Lots of leg room since I got emergency exit seat. Seat cannot be adjusted backwards. Staff seemed to be efficient. No problems with this airline and will use them again.,0
"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. For a budget airfare getting you to destination and plenty of in air service with drinks and foods. You get what you pay for and that is fine. No heavy turbulence,  aircraft in good shape take off and landing good. Managed to change my flight for another holiday and that was bit back and forth but managed to do that online for a reasonable price. Layover 2 times went smoothly, staff friendly and overall satisfied for getting me safe to my destination and back.",0
"Raipur to Kolkata. I know Indigo is a low cost carrier but the only good thing is ""On-time Performance"". Their cabin crew were reluctant to provide a full glass of water. I do not have any options to select seats during checking using kiosk and was randomly assigned a middle seat of last row. The leg space was too small for me.",1
"Worst customer service ever! We booked our flight to Puerto Princessa that was supposed to depart at 8:30 am. Then the airline changed our flight to 11:30 am. We arrived 2 hours before our 11:30 am flight and upon boarding time, I discovered that we were not listed as checked-in although we were checked-in online. The airline agents at the counter were so rude. They said they called our names but we never heard our names called. I asked for a supervisor. Then this guy with walks up and I asked if he was a supervisor and he said yes but refused to give me his name. I noticed his ID badge was turned around so you couldnt see the name. The airline agents at the counter also had their ID badges turned inwards so you cant see the names. Is this their standard operating procedures? I ended up getting on another flight at 3:30 pm so we lost a lot of time dealing with this sun-standard airline. Never again will we fly with Cebu Pacific.",1
Last Sunday morning we went to Gold Coast Airport bound for Singapore. On arrival we were greeted by a cheerful woman behind a separate Biz Counter who processed our details within a couple of minutes. When boarding was called the usual crowd surged to the front. As advertised there was a special entry aisle for Scoot Biz Class but it was hard to see because of the crowd. We were actually first on board and our seats were as planned. As soon as we sat down we were served with cold water with a friendly greeting. A lot has been said about the Biz Class seats and some of it sadly is true but travellers must remember the fare is about a quarter of what other Australian airlines charge and half of that charged by rival Air Asia. They don't leave a lot of elbow room and don't recline to the floor but they are on the whole fairly comfortable for the money we paid. The food was nothing special it was tasty.,0
Flew from Hong Kong to Cebu in March 2015. My wife did the booking so I was spared the aggravation of dealing with CP booking procedures and the constantly changing/escalating prices throughout the process. The usual complete chaos at Cebu Pacific check-in HK with insufficient check in staff and no organisation with a planeload of customers queuing for one Cebu flight desk up to the last minute whilst later CP flights were being also being checked-in. CP routinely boards from the satellite terminal which is a bus ride away from the main airport terminal. Stressful start to the journey. Once on the flight you realise why headline prices are so cheap with the bare minimum of legroom no food or even water unless you pay. Overall cheap but uncomfortable and stressful.,1
Think twice before booking connecting flights with Indigo in India. The baggage allowance is 15kg checked-in / 7kg carryon includes personal item. Recently traveled from Amritsar to Delhi. Learnt the hard way. No thought given to Int'l travelers. Inflight not even a glass of water offered to passengers who have not ordered pre-book meal.,1
"The flight was retimed and delayed by 3 hours, and not reflected onto FlightStatus or any other online flight tracking platform. The ground staff said that they will not update the feeds. My delay benefits for lounge access is automatically processed when delays are reflected on FlightStatus. Im now waiting in the airport for the past 3 hours, with another 3 to go before my flight. My flight from Singapore to Perth was also delayed by 3 hours, of which 2 was spent in the cabin, on the ground, as staff tried to remove luggage of non-flying passengers who likely abandoned plans due to the flight delay. The flight crew made no attempt to explain the delay properly for the entire duration, leaving quite a number of passengers frustrated. If Scoot was a responsible operator, they should have timed their flights more properly and accurately. I will steer clear of Scoot in the future.",1
Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur booked for 29th April. It's the pandemic right now so I wanted to reach out and ask if I could change my flight date then through their customer service line they said to reach them through twitter or Facebook so fine. Used twitter instead because Facebook was irresponsive last time used. Dropped a text no response now great it passed 48 hours in changing went there to change it counter was close it's before 5pm but I'd understand the pandemic. No resources online to reach out to anyone to change and it seems like this ticket is going to burn cause it doesn't give much of an option. Not going to use this airline again,1
Bali - Melbourne 29 December. Business. A comfortable flight with very attentive and friendly staff. The seats are quite comfortable although nothing like Qantas or Singapore Airlines Business class. More like premium economy. The food was very filling and tasty with an excellent choice of drinks. My only complaint is that the IFE included was very limited. Just a very small selection of movies and music. Overall a very pleasant flight and worth the extra cost.,0
"We flew from Sydney to Melbourne 11th April flight number JQ513. Charged $60 for being 2kg overweight yet same suitcase and clothes as flight to Sydney last week and was no problem. Staff then had the cheek to ask me to get change from the cafe opposite as had no float or change, and still no eye contact. Will never fly with Jetstar again.",1
"They are refusing to refund flights cancelled because of COVID 19 from 15 March onwards. They are giving us false options to choose between full refund and travel fund in their official site, but actually you are forced to accept travel fund which 90% of people won't be able to use anyway. What's even worse, their customer care is not even replying on multiple emails and complaints for weeks. They really deserve the lowest possible score. Tourists should boycot this airlines 100% for all their lies and I definitely won't use it again.",1
"10am morning flight, Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. Overall the flight was okay for this price. The flight was very smooth, nice take off, cruising and landing. Cabin staff service was also surprisingly good. Staff smiled and were friendly and helpful. However, the flight was delayed about 30 minutes on arrival, and the seat pitch was awful, far too - hope this will change in the future. Overall, despite the delay and seat pitch, it was a good experience, cheap price but good quality flight.",0
Flew with AirAsia from Johor Baharu to Bangkok Don Muang Airport. Smooth check in because I had already checked in at Bangkok DMK Airport and printed the boarding pass there because my route on 8 Jan was: DMK-SIN / JHB-DMK. The price of this route was very cheap. Pre-booked meal was vegetarian ginger fried rice and vegetable biryani. For me Vegetable Biryani was not ideal but it was tasty. Arrived early in DMK Airport.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. AirAsia is known with low-cost fare, but does it mean Low cost = no service? Other than Low-cost fare, Air Asia well known with flight delay, flight rescheduled, poor customer service. It happens regularly that the flight rescheduled on every single flight. Other than the Air Asia low price on promotion is attractive, you'll not surprise if you heard any bad feedback comment about how AA disappointing customer. I'm not the first one and I believe will not be the last one. How AA Customers support system fooling customer around? It must be a platform to train your patience. AA customer support system has 4 ways to contact Air Asia which are Live chat (24/7), call centre, Twitter(24/7) and e-form. I have tried 4 of them: Live chat (24/7): it has been removed - 26 Dec 2018 URL No Longer Exists You have to wait for average 1 hour on live chat queue to say hi to a live chat staff. If you miss the screen when the conversation started, you will kick out from the chatroom by livechat staff, when you check back the screen, it showed ""thank you for contacted live chat"". You have to wait for another one hour. Live chat staff could simply end your conversation without your notice, so even your question not yet finish,you will be kicked out by the staff again. Call centre: I have called to call centre from Malaysia at RM2 per minute! I wanted to buy/add-on/upgrade my baggage to 25kg (3 days before my flight), but it is no longer available on ""modify"" at the airasia homepage. The only way is you have to call them (yes waste time + money), otherwise it would me RM45/kg (not sure they increase the price or not) at the check-in counter. waiting time: generally 10 minutes. Twitter (24/7) the so-called ""24/7"" Twitter service is totally a lie. You can tweet them 24/7, but they will only reply to you immediately, most of the time a few hours or few days. (tweet them for 5 months due to my lost bag case). When the staff is free they will tell you Please wait for the investigation or there's not much they can do, please contact live chat/call/e-form. Live chat, twitter and call centre will push all the responsibility to e-form. Ask you to contact e form. E-form has annoyed and wasted my time the most. It took few days/about 1 month to reply to you, they could just reply sorry that they have done their best and simply closed the case straight after. I've created the same case for 3 times because the staff closed my case without solving my problem, but it is written in the email that my case has been solved, or you didn't reply the email within 7 days. Here comes the tactic: at first you can still contact the AA staffs, but after 3-4 emails, suddenly your reply cannot reach to the AA support team and this will end up case closed because the system shows that you didnt reply to the AA email. When you reply, a no reply email message will tell you that your case has closed, if you need any assistant, please send an e form again! I strongly advise you be aware when you book the AA ticket. The price is really attractive, but please make sure you add on all the bag, meal etc. For the locals, I suggest you check also the price from Malaysia Airlines, Fireflyz and Malindo.",1
The worst airline flying from Manila to Iloilo. The flight was delayed and going back from Iloilo to Manila was delayed 6 hours for no reason they do not inform you as of why they are delayed. They had other flights that came and went but were priority flights but not ours lots of upset people.,1
"Three months out we purchased and paid for return tickets Melbourne to Bangkok. I added the business max package as this was our holiday of a lifetime through Europe and my wife had 5yrs earlier donated a kidney to me. I wanted this to be a special experience. 4 weeks out the return arrangements were changed from a direct flight to coming via Singapore with a different code flight. A little inconvenient but not being seasoned travelers didn't worry. At 5pm the day before departure Jetstar emailed that the outbound flight was cancelled. Their call center organized seats on a Qantas domestic to Sydney and connected to Qantas to Bangkok. The call center were deceptive in not disclosing there were no business class seats available on either leg. When asked the seat numbers we were told these would be allocated at the airport. At the terminal when all was disclosed Jetstar after 12minutes wait advised to see the Jetstar staff at the terminal. Our Qantas flight was due to leave at 6.30am, Jetstar staff don't start work till 7am. This flight was our only option to make our connection in Bangkok. After our holiday and 2 days before Bangkok we found our seating allocated Bangkok to Singapore as 1A & 1B. We boarded Jetstar Asia to find their is no business class and apparently you order meals in advance on their web site but non of this was ever advised and so no meals were provided. A coffee was $4. The embarrassment of having your meal tray down and being bypassed was incredibly stressing. The last leg Singapore to Melbourne was business class. Some compensation was negotiated but not to cover the hurt, embarrassment and disgusting treatment at the hands of this airline.",1
"First they changed my flight dates and times over 14 times which that itself is very disturbing. Then again when i couldn't travel, they basically cancelled my flight and provided me the option to store in my travel refund. But when i requested for a full refund, they do not have the option on their website and they told me it would take 45 days to get a full refund and its been over a year now. Then i have been recently notified that my request has been declined which i must store the money in my travel fund which i do not want.",1
"We had an early flight out of Bangkok, we came early, no long lines before we came to passport control, there we waited around 20 minutes. Departure and arrival on time, I think Cebu Pacific are pretty clever to get their planes on time, even with the airport conditions they have to live with in Manila. We had a pre-ordered meal, that was a waste of money. The bad thing about Cebu Pacific is the very narrow seats. I am 1.83 and I sat with my knees in the seat in front of me for three hours. On the first leg to Bangkok, I had an aisle seat, I sat looking at the boarding passengers, when a very big guy, entered. He came down the aisle and of course he had the middle seat on my row! He took around 1.5 seats when he sat down, we were very lucky that the plane was not fully booked. They will get new planes in the coming years, where their seats are even more narrow, no thanks.",0
"Kaohsiung to Singapore. We would like to thank the captain and cabin crew of TR287 on 19 Aug that they provided assistance to my husband who was not feeling well after landing. Cabin crew attended to us promptly. They provided him with blanket and water to keep him warm and secured him on a wheelchair in order to transfer him out from the aircraft to the airport terminal. The captain and crew even helped to carry my luggages all the way.  Without their kind help and teamwork, we couldn't be able to arrive home safely. We're very touched by thier kind concerns and professional assistance! Thank you.",0
"I had booked a flight from Mumbai to Guwahati and back for Nov 2022. In October 2022 Indigo cancelled the flight and given an option for refund, saying the full amount will be paid to you. After getting assurance that I will get a full refund, I confirmed for cancellation. But later I got an email that part amount will be deducted towards agent booking charges. If the cancellation is by Indigo why do I bear such cancellation charges?",1
"I think Scoots service quality has declined significantly these days. Yesterday (Jan 23, 2015), I was flying with my friend from Sydney to Singapore. Our flight was delayed. However, neither the check-in desk staff nor the digital displays said anything about the delay. We realized about the delay only when we reached the boarding gate at 1:15PM and found no plane there. The flight took off at 5:51PM (Sydney Time), 4 hours after the original departure time. However, instead of Scoots promised 50 dollar voucher for 4 hour delay, the crews shook off their responsibility for the delay by offering the passengers a bottle of water and a packet of chips. Even in that case, they could not provide chips and water bottle for every passenger. In addition,  I and my friend requested the check-in staff to give us seats in the middle of the plane if possible. The check-in desk staff told us that she is giving us seats 44D/F (My friend on 44D, me on 44E and 44F is empty) and we two can use these three seats. However, when we went in, we found that another passenger is assigned to seat 44F. I really dont understand why it was necessary to lie to us. She was not obliged to give us seats according to our request.",1
"We booked two flights with Scoot - one from Berlin to Singapore, one from Singapore to Melbourne. A lot of things have been missing. We already knew that they wont offer us any food for free, but we expected something to drink, at least water. Nothing was given to us on either flight. The staff was unfriendly. It was impossible to close the blinds, so there was light constantly. There was no opportunity to charge your phone for free (only for 5$) and no TVs. If you order a meal for 13, you only get one dish (very small), a bottle of water or a coke and one dessert, e.g. a friend got a 15g pack of crisps, we got a Ritter Sport chocolate. I can accept all of these things for a cheaper price, but I expect to get at least some water. On our second flight, they promised we could fill up our water bottles in between the security check and before going into the plane, but then they said its too late and weve been in there with nothing. So if you come prepared, you can choose Scoot, but I wouldnt recommend it.",1
Jakarta to Singapore (QZ7782) and back (QZ7789) on the same day. No delays. The right Low Cost Carrier experience: no frills no food no leg room efficient.,0
"The cabin was very hot. We were waiting on the runway for about half an hour, after that, they announced problems with the air-conditioning, but said it would be ok after take-off. Another half an hour, another announcement, only in Indonesian. Everyone onboard got angry (the increasing heat did not help) and started exiting the plane. No staff were able to explain what was going on - they only word was 'sorry'. People deboarded and were arguing while standing on the runway for another 15 minutes. Then we were shuffled to back to the terminal and told to wait for a replacement aircraft. Their ineptitude to tell us what's going on really surprised me. Never flying with Lion Air again.",1
"Shenzhen to Kota Kinabalu. The FA leaned on the desk without smile at boarding time, after entering the cabin, the FAs didn't assist any woman or elderly person in packing their luggage. They just standing in the aisle. And the FA called me back to my seat, I just want to changed seat with others. I don't think I  can understand the flight attendant instructions in case of an emergency. It was a Red-eye flight, everyone wanted to sleep, but the cabin was always lit. And they spoke so loudly that I could hear laughter with earplugs. I  didn't sleep all night. Although I don't want any service, it's very uncomfortable for me to have a bad rest on a 3 hour flight.",1
Manila to Cagayan de Oro City. Bought 2 round trip tickets with prepaid baggage allowance. Lines to check-in disorganized check-in counter employees unfamiliar with luggage rules Ended up paying for 2 one way ticket bound for Cagayn de Oro due to one luggage that we were going to pay for in the first place but was told that we didn't have to so we missed the plane. Took almost an hour to fall in line to pay for the luggage fee no one to help expedite in order to be on time to board. As often as we go back to the Philippines for a visit we will avoid taking Cebu Pacific.,1
BKK to Hat Yai (HDY) and noticed service deterioration. Flight retimed one month in advance and cause me minor itinerary problem (despite their offer to change to earlier or later flight). Only one Bag drop counter for internet/ Kiosk check in opened. Their advertisement that internet check in is quicker and hassle - free is totally untrue. Once on board A320 aircraft is new and clean but seat pitch is a very tight. Aptitude of the crew does not seemed to be as good as their earlier year. My friend who sit upfront tried to purchase chicken rice and was told that only curry is available but I was told later that I can only get chicken rice because my curry is finished.,1
DPS-SIN. Efficient check in and boarding. Flight left on time and seat was comfortable. Food was tasty and cheap (bought on line before). Overall a great experience and everything that you could ask for from a low cost airline.,0
"Sydney to Singapore. Scoot are fine for a budget no-frills airline. The seats and leg-room are OK as are the planes. But whatever you do, do not prepay for any ""extras"", as it's a lottery if you end up getting them or not. I prepaid for numerous extras on a recent trip to Singapore (meals, seat selection) and only got about half of them, resulting in stand-and(& the food was lousy!). It appears their cost-cutting extends to their general administration.",0
Flew SIN-BKK-SIN. Plane was ok although a bit old as these were old SQ planes. But considering some other airlines it is still an acceptable age plane. I guess Scoot didn't do much rework of the interiors as they are expecting new planes to be delivered. The legroom in ScootBiz was ok. Seats was ok and was neither comfortable or uncomfortable. It could have been better if food was better there were more drinks that could be offered to ScootBiz class. However I may choose an economy class (exit row seat) on its parent company Singapore Airlines anytime if the price difference is not huge.,0
"I departed Ho Chi Minh on the 21st Jan 2024 on flight TR 303. We occupied the whole row as a family on 6A, 6B and 6C. We arrived in Singapore on a bus gate and as soon as we got out from the bus, we realised we left a bag containing a new pair of Le Silla heels just purchased from Ho Chi Minh store under the seat in front of us at 6B. We asked if we could go back to the plane but was denied but directed to the Lost and Found to lodge a complaint. Calls that we made to inquire on the status were directed to India. We called day after day and two weeks later at the Lost and Found at T1, the heels were not found. Staff at the Lost and Found informed me that items on Scoot are sometimes returned by crew or cleaning staff.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru. Flight was delayed by 45 minutes due to late arrival of aircraft. Overall, flight was routine and crew were professional. Just cross your fingers each time you fly AirAsia that your flight isn't delayed or worse, cancelled (which was what happened to me on another AirAsia flight).",0
I travelled on Jetstar JQ174 from Christchurch to Melbourne. I was able to check in three hours before departure at 6pm at the automated machines. Unfortunately Customs & Immigration was closed until 7:30pm. Missed the business lounge and had to make do with Burger King. On boarding I was the first person to board as they called the back of the aircraft first and a was seated next to the gate. Had a spare seat between my next passenger. The flight overall was good.,0
Manila to Singapore. I had the worst experience from an airline in my life. It was unbelievably disrespectful and I was unfairly treated in Manila airport. Missed my flight due to long queue in the immigration despite checking in early and the flight took off earlier than departure date but thats not the problem. The way I was treated at the gate was a disgrace. Instead of trying to listen to my queries I was bombarded by remarks where its not the airlines fault and its entirely all my fault and the airline is not liable. I was only trying to raise my queries 1) what happened to my ticket 2) whats the alternative to get to my destination. At least I get an idea what can I do next. But all I get is a small piece of paper with the customer service number to reach out to (called the number and all I get was voicemail - all executives were busy). Managed to get through once and while verifying the phone got dropped off. The most surprising thing is all the staff at the gate just left! Left me by myself! I had to hunt for my luggage somewhere at the 4th floor of the airport and again! No one was there. They had no idea where my luggage was and they made me wait at the corner for 45 minutes at around 12.30am. This is disgraceful for an airline. Whats worst is how I was being treated. Maybe those staff are just hurrying to go home with their bag packs. Absolute disgrace! Maybe its a one off but this is the worst experience Ive had in my life!,1
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. Mobile check in allowed me to avoid queuing in Jakarta. The plane left on time. It was pretty full and my middle seat felt quite uncomfortable. Other than that, the usual AirAsia flight with business like crew and a good selection of food for purchase.",0
KUL (LCCT)-LGK (Langkawi) return. AirAsia's Terminal is basic but efficient as are the staff. Both flights were smooth in A320s that looked brand new. For both flights we had seats in row 2 where space seemed bigger than other rows behind but ok for a 50 minute flight. Staff were friendly and the captain's announcements were clear and professional. I can only recommend them.,0
"Sydney to Melbourne. Extremely poor customer service. 120$ surcharge for 1kg over. Harassed to weigh our luggage more than 5 times, watched over when tossing things out, rude flight attendant.",1
"Jetstar please check the accuracy of your scales! Flying from Cairns to Sydney with Jetstar. Really unhappy with the customer service at the check-in. I thought we might have some overweight hand luggage but hoped that checked in luggage can balance it out. What came out for my surprise our checked in luggage was over 30kg each. And early morning in the airport panicking, throwing our clothes and personal items to the bins because cheap airline company Jetstar does not allow more than 7kg each to flight, even when the next ones have other regulations as 10kg hand luggage. So in Sydney, we weighed our checked-in luggage again and those were both under 30, which would have given us some balancing room for the stuff we throw away and pay less for extra kilos. I strongly advise to check how much your luggage weighs before, or some other scales or just compare with different ones in the airport. Jetstar is clearly there for the money making. Even before boarding they walk around with their tiny scale to catch overweight luggage and this is just humiliating - how low can this cheap company go? Im pretty sure soon you are not allowed to bring any free carry on luggage and maybe you have to start paying for your seat in the plane as well. Never again with this company. Felt so ridiculously stupid there trying to figure out what things Ill throw away.",1
Flight JQ 151 SYD to CHC. 5th June 2014. Travelling as a group of 4 3 names were on the manifest and 1 was not. Despite showing the loading attendant our confirmation for the passenger she showed absolutely no concern and would not make any further enquires. The result was that we had to fly on leaving our friend to sort things out in Sydney. This he did and it was found to be a Jetstar error. The rudeness and total unhelpfulness of the person in charge of the boarding gate shows just why this airline continues to rank amongst the top of the list of unpopular airlines. Never again Jetstar.,1
"Our overall journey was a nightmare from booking. We received no notice that our initial flight schedule was cancelled (friends travelling with us had been notified, not us), to extra travel legs being included with long wait times between flights. Long delay with stupid reasons given, poor pre paid food. Non existent entertainment packages. G",1
"Tried to buy additional 10 kg baggage from AirAsia website https://www.airasia.com/member/mybookings#tab-flights on 18 June using my credit card. After 3 fail attempts due to my cc wasnt able to be verified, I gave up. Checked my email the next day before my flight, didnt receive any email confirmation that my additional 10 kg baggage purchase has been approved. I decided to only bring one check in luggage weight only 19 kg When I checked in in jakarta airport, i was forced to pay Rp. 223,009 for additional 10 kg baggage which transaction wasnt successful or been confirmed. Tried to ask for my refund from AirAsia customer service at Denpasar airport was told to go through AVA which were very helpful airasia customer service hosted by AI, after waiting waiting for more than an hour, my queue was terminated,  Without email confirmation whether the transaction was successful, they just forced me to pay something you didnt purchase?",1
"Spoke to 3 different phone operators for a particular customer service issue regarding vouchers, was told 3 different answers, placed on hold repeatedly (cumulatively for well over an hour), ended up receiving a case number and was never called back. Atrocious customer service, would avoid Jetstar like the plague.",1
"This company should be offering refunds not vouchers during the Covid-19 crisis. Beware: They also change your flights without notifying you. Even once the flight is cancelled, they only offer a voucher. They trick their customers out of a refund in which they are entitled to. If you call them to discuss your options, be prepared to be on hold for minimum 4 hours before being disconnected. They give a short deadline to accept a voucher, expecting a decision without being able to discuss your options with them, as they give not other option but a voucher. Eventually, I got through to them via Messenger. It was like talking to a robot. They repeat their phrases as if it is scripted. Terrible customer service, just another greedy company. Zero stars.",1
For a budget airline its not bad you pay extra for everything and I knew this going into the flight. So I ordered two meals and had two waters. About 6 1/2 hours into my flight I went to the back of the plane and ask the attendant for a cup of ice to drink my water in so I could take my medicine. She said no ice on plane. Muffled with the post Covid mask on. I went back to my seat and drank my water and took my medicine.  The WiFi didnt work on both legs unless you wanted to order something from the attendant. Plus you get to recheck bags traveling through Japan each way.,1
"Sydney to Manila. As a budget airline it sits amongst similar airlines. I am yet to see a Cebu Pacific flight leave on time. Whatever the quoted departure/arrival times are, allow at least an hour more - often longer. Being a low cost airline, there is no entertainment apart from the staff who really only attend to Philippine travelers. They have played a quiz game on each flight I've been on - unfortunately the question is shouted form the front of the plane, so good luck in hearing it. The seats are generally comfortable enough for the roughly 9 hour flight. Take a snack with you, the food is not that appealing. Be aware: Sydney to Manila, you can take water with you. Manila to Sydney you can't. No Wifi - I hate to think what they would charge if the had it.",1
"Manila to Coron. The worst local airline in the Philippines.  Our Flights have been changed two times and yet we couldn't even get empathy from the  people working in this Company! They are always going on overbooking and would just reason out that its beyond their control as they are doing flight realignments. How many times would you do that  flight realignment in one month if you are not going overbooked? We cannot always accept your lame excuse Cebu Pacific! You are getting 3stars here because you are giving low fares that just a plus factor on you, but if these people will experience the worst things that we had for you negative score is what they'll give you (if that could only be possibly given in a review!",1
Flew MEL-MCY-MEL for a holiday on the Sunshine Coast. A computer problem at Tullamarine created long check-in queues but staff were checking to make sure waiting passengers did not miss departure deadlines and our flight left on time and arrived a tad early. Seating is a bit squashed but as to be expected from a budget carrier. Cabin crew were cheery and helpful. Didn't bother with the food. Return flight on time and uneventful. All in all value for the money.,0
We flew Tulla to Bali and return the new 787 is a nice aircraft seats were good. We paid a lot of money for these flights due to school holidays and Easter ($2487 for two adults). To say they give you nothing other than your seat is very true you pay for everything else!! A pillow and blanket is $10!! I purchased meals online prior to trip which cost another $60 and for movies each way another $40. Luggage took over 45 minutes to be unloaded when we returned to Melb. Would not fly with them again unless it was very cheap just like their service. Can't believe Qantas own this very budget airline. Hate to say this but next time it will be with Garuda who supply a full service.,1
"Cebu Pacific and their staff couldn't sink much lower. Arrived at MNL terminal 3 at 9 am for 10.55hrs flight, check in smooth, at around 09.40hrs announcement made that both the 1000hrs and 10.55hrs flights to Davao were delayed due to late arrival of turnaround aircraft! Stock announcement made for virtually every departure this day! I approached customer services who were not interested in providing any information, or assistance and it would appear to offer standard advise of just sit and wait. Was however advised by a manager that the flight would depart at 1200hrs. At 1200hrs no announcements made and staff were now advising that the flight would now depart at 1300hrs. At 1300hrs told 1400hrs, then 1435hrs. Finally boarded at 1500hrs but then sat aboard for another 30 minutes waiting for pushback. Finally arriving in DVO at 1755Hrs. Overall it would appear that customer Service staff are not interested in giving any constructive or accurate advise to passengers and will happily just say anything no matter how ludicrous, just to keep customers placated. At 1245hrs was told the flight had landed and was being serviced for departure. At 1300 this had changed to waiting for aircraft to land. Then at 1400hrs they blamed ATC saying no idea when it will land. Was even told the flight had been waiting to land for over 2 hours. Most airlines around the world are proud of their punctuality and strive to achieve the goal of customer satisfaction. Sadly Cebu Pacific don't know the meaning of this industry standard ethos and achieving an acceptable level of punctuality or customer satisfaction is completely unknown to them. Often proudly announcing on-time punctuality as low as 50-60% for the month. In a country which heavily relies on an airline network to service outlying islands, both the country and people of the Philippines deserve better than this debacle of an airline. Cannot score it 0/10 for that is the true score it deserves.",1
Flew ScootBiz from PER-SIN-PER for a family holiday. After reading other reviews people must realise you get what you pay for! I am 6 ft 5 and found the seats in ScootBiz cabin perfectly comfortable. I have flown Singapore airlines on the same route and yes they are a first class airline no doubt but a fare which cost less than half of what a Singapore Airlines economy seat fare does the issue stops. Food included with the ticket was OK plane was on time and clean. Forget all the other whinging gripes people have if you want an airlines which offers the bare basics but an affordable trip go for Scoot if you need to have your every whim and desire satisfied go with a full service carrier. Will happily fly Scoot again in the future.,0
Queenstown to Sydney. The worst check in experience it seems possible to have. The mobile app doesnt work but even if users did it would be pointless. There was on airport check in counters but only 2 people on the counter to check in 3 flights! Took over an hour from printing boarding passes to be able to drop our bags! If you are going to get people to check in themselves then why not just run a single bag drop lane? It makes absolutely no sense. By the time I got on the cramped and uncomfortable aircraft I was so frustrated that I will not ever fly this carrier again. Will much rather pay a little bit extra and use Virgin or Qantas,1
"Delhi to Kolkata. The flight experience was good but my luggage  holding straps were damaged, unable to carry it. I think luggage handling was very irresponsible.",1
"Flew Hyderabad to Sydney via Singapore with Scoot. First they delayed the flight by 18hrs, changed our meal options, seating options and then at the airport the gate changed 2 times. Traveling with senior citizens and a 5 year old it was a very bad experience.",1
"Gold Coast to Singapore. Was due to be traveling to Singapore for just 1 day. Taking my wifes parents out of the country to comply with immigration laws and then returning to Australia. Everything seemed normal, we booked online and entered all  information including passport details and expiry. Arrived at the airport and Scoot said I could not travel due to my passport only has 5 months before it expires. Why did they not tell me this when I entered my passport details onto their website when booking? I could have organised another one in time as we had months from the time we booked the tickets. They told me it is common knowledge and I should have known this and that is is in their contracts. So we lost 3 return tickets and accommodation totaling $3,824.They could and should have their web developers enter a simple script that alerts anyone to this fact when entering their passport expiry date. I do not recommend Scoot.",1
Recently flew return from Bangkok Don Muang to Chiang Mai. Check-in was very good at both airports both flights were on time nice clean aircraft and first rate cabin crew.,0
"I have not flown on this flight yet. It's a future reservation that I have with them, and need to cancel because my onward/return journey between Mumbai and Seychelles that was part of the overall travel itinerary was cancelled due to Covid restrictions in Seychelles for passengers from India. So I need to cancel these IndiGo flights, as I have no need to travel to Mumbai and back now. When I call the customer service line to cancel, I get the following: They mention flight fees and changes on their website but fail to mention that they charge these per passenger per flight/sector when you need make changes or cancellations to your reservation. For a $180 round trip flight booked for my wife and I from Tirupati to Mumbai and back, they were saying I will get a refund of $28 even though I'm canceling almost 2 months in advance. Based on their USD cancellation fee of $45 that should be charged for cancellations made 4+ days before departure, I should receive a $135 refund. Or if they were strictly following this fee applied per person per flight, then that would be $45 per person per way, i.e. $45x4=$180 so I should not receive any refund. But they make an arbitrary calculation that I get $28 refund. They pretend to be a low-cost carrier that's friendly to the middle class in India, but actually charge obscene cancellation/change fees.",1
"Flew from Mumbai to Bhubaneswar with IndiGo. It was the first time I was traveling in an A320neo aircraft so was quite excited about it. At the airport check-in was done smoothly without standing in any queue. While boarding the aircraft the cabin crew welcomed us with their smiling faces. The aircraft cabin seemed neat and clean. The lavatories were clean. The seats were quite comfortable and wide. The legroom was quite good. The food menu consisted of sandwiches, instant biryanis as well as instant noodles. I decided to go for sandwiches. They tasted good. The flight departed on time but arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled time of arrival. Really it was a pleasure traveling with them.",0
"They change our flight from 6.30pm to 8.45pm without proper informing. We waited at airport for 4hours and went on board by 8pm plus until 930pm we been ask to go down and until now 11pm,we are still at Kuala Lumpur. We suppose be arrived by 9pm and change to 11pm and now 11pm, I'm still here. No apology to the passenger. Not only that, the seat arm rest are broken and stick with cloth tape.",1
"Singapore to Perth with Scoot, a low-cost airline but with a modern Boeing 787 fleet. Efficient check-in with dedicated ScootBiz lane and embarkation with Biz pax first on board. Seating is hardly business class, more like premium economy. Staff mostly smiling and friendly, efficient to the point of rote. For example, the meal provide in Scootbiz is very basic but reasonably tasty. However, my companion had ordered a different meal to mine. When the attendant was asked for an ice cream the same as is available on my meal, was told no, it was only a Toblerone with her meal. Do it by the book! Looking back to the main cabin there was a separate 'quiet' zone directly behind business area, no children allowed, but low and behold two very small crying children in business section! Scoot, overall, have a good LCC product which compares favourably and in many cases exceeds, service on other airlines. The only downside was the disastrous arrival in Perth, an airport designed, and operated, like one from the 1960s, with zero service standards. Just dreadful.",0
"Online system allowed to buy hot seats but after boarded the plane, my wife and my son were asked to give up our hot seats for normal ones because my teenage son is below the age requirement. Manage to navigate a way to submit a case to the airline via the app. Within a week, the case was closed just like that.  Worst customer service.",1
JQ1 Sydney to Melbourne a few weeks ago. The standard of service and customer communication I received from this airline was horrible! The old A330-200 aircraft was dated and the leg room was bad even for economy. Ground staff treated us more like cattle than passengers if it wasn't for my ability to run with the crowd I would have been trampled whilst boarding as there was no line or structure to this process. Once the cabin crew completed their food and beverage service you never saw them again until disembarking. Once we landed it took them about 40 minutes before we received our luggage. All over very disappointing - you get what you pay for!,1
"I was notified that my flight was cancelled, so I requested a refund. Today at the airport I saw the flight I had booked flew today. Asking for answers from AirAsia they tried to blame me just to clarify, you are asking for a refund for the missed flight?",1
Transferring via Manila is to be avoided. Cebu staff will confiscate your passport and keep for hours. Nowhere are things handled this unprofessional and without clear information. Avoid Cebu Pacific and avoid transferring via Manila.,1
"Sydney to Ballina/ Simply appalling. Check-in staff were rude, cruel, had no patience or smile. No please or thank you. Disgraceful. Fanatical about overweight baggage to the 100 gram. Tried to suck every penny out. Abysmal.",1
"Flew Sydney to Launceston. Jetstar provided a good quality product and service. I paid a low fare and could check in via their app up to 28 days in advance. The flight left on time, arrived early, and the crew were professional and helpful. There was also good information from the flight deck. LCCs tend to get hammered when things go wrong or maybe when customers dont do their research, but I knew what Jetstar offered and what they didnt when I bought the ticket and I feel they are good value and relatively comfortable to fly with. My only negative was the long line for bag drop in Sydney. Maybe a Melbourne-style automated system would be better.",0
"Flew from Singapore to Bali, JQ117. My flight departed with slight delay and arrived around 15-20 minutes ahead of time. Jetstar's Ground Service and Crew were kind, friendly and efficient. The ticket was quite expensive for early morning flight but I have no option since I need to go to another destinations from Bali. The seat was comfortable enough for standard low cost carrier. Overall, it was a pleasant flight.",0
"We purchased a cheap deal ticket from Perth to Athens via Singapore to fly in July 2017. We only decided to go to Athens as it was such a cheap deal. Scoot was selling cheap tickets to establish its first route to Europe. We then went on to book all of our ongoing flights to Italy and accomodation. We are having our wedding in Italy so it's a very special trip. Scoot then changed our outgoing flight by 3 days. At first they were only willing to give a travel voucher for a refund, now they are offering a refund but it will take 8 weeks to process. In the meantime we still have to purchase tickets to Athens at a premium price - a destination that we didn't need to fly into, we only decided to go that route to save money. Our trip is now costing us a fortune. Scoot have completely soured our wedding trip. What should be the happiest time of our lives is now completely stressful. I do not recommend this airline and would never fly with them or Singapore Airlines again.",1
"Avalon to Gold Coast. They cancelled a flight and left passengers to find their own way to another airport for a later flight, then flew us to a different destination too. They showed a complete lack of consideration for their passengers and did not offer any valid compensation (6 month non transferable voucher offered, although we told them no possibility of using it).",1
Round trip Bangkok to Chiang Mai. The problems started trying to book the flight online. A truly painful process and ended up a much more costly experience than first expected with extras and charges you even have to pay for choosing a seat. As for the flights outwards was fine but all I can say on the return leg is - if the company uses the same guidelines of employing non customer facing staff as they do with the customer facing staff then disaster is only a matter of time.,1
"I'm incredibly disappointed by the appalling service provided by Indigo Airlines during my recent transit experience at Chennai airport. The mishandling of 5 guests who were flying to Colombo due to the Trichy flight delay by 1 hour is a clear testament to the utter lack of competence and professionalism displayed by the airline.  Not only was there a complete lack of communication about the delay and the subsequent impact on connecting flights, but the airline failed to provide any assistance or support.  It's clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this airline,",1
"Jakarta to Denpasar. During check in there was an extremely long line. The staff noticed us and brought us through the front of the line and quickly checked us in. The walking distance from check in to the gate was fairly easy as this was a domestic flight. At the gate we took a bus ride to the plane.  The flight was delayed by approximately 30 minutes however the landing at the destination was only delayed by 10 minutes. The flight was quick and smooth; however no food or beverages were served or offered as there were none. Although a small water bottle was offered for Rp 10,000 or approximately less then a dollar. There was no in flight entertainment system also. However food and beverages could be packed or bought from the airport and allowed in the flight. This flight was last minute booked but we still got a good price. The only issue were the lavatories. There were only 4, they were not cleaned properly. Lion Air was decent and is recommended for its low price.",0
"My flight timing was changed from 2PM to 8.45AM for 1st of April for Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur.  I was given the option for a full refund if the timing is not right. However I contacted them for the full refund and they never got back to me. I have been frantically trying to contact them via calls, emails, live chat, twitter, facebook since March 1. None of these methods work. There was no reply whatsoever from their customer service. I've tried calling every one of their physical office but none of the numbers work. There is no way to contact them at all.   Seat and aircraft dirty and magazine is never complete. Their budget ticket is quite expensive.",1
"Manila to Iloilo. Probably the worst airline, located in the worst airport in the world, NAIA 3. From the check in process to flying delayed, it is hell on earth. Checkin was a mess. Employees were rude and inconsiderate. Plane is old and smells bad. Fly on another airline. Avoid this at all costs.",1
Adelaide to Sydney. I've been travelling for years and especially with Jetstar but no more the staff were rude and do nothing to help elderly people. They changed gates 5 minutes to board. I had to push my mum in a wheelchair and was hard as I'm dealing with a hernia. To top it off they cancelled our flight and saying it was an act of God and but at gate 25 they gave our plane away. Jetstar said cancelling our flight was an act of God on Monday night but after speaking to friends in Sydney it wasn't that bad ... Qantas took off 20 minutes before our flight.  All in all Jetstar are definitely not the airline you want to travel with.,1
"During Chinese New Year I flew from Singapore to Kalibo (Boracay) return with Scoot. Both flights left on time. I ordered and paid for a premium meal online. Unfortunately, I was informed that my meal was not available once I boarded the plane. I was disappointed. However, I asked if it was possible to have the sides/snacks and to substitute my chosen main meal with another meal available on the flight. I asked the cabin staff if they could do this as I did not want to seek a refund. The cabin staff stated that this was fine. Generally, I found the cabin staff to be friendly and attentive.",0
"I have connecting flight from DXB-MNL-RXS. The flight was delayed for more than 2 hours. When i reached to domestic flight transfer Helpdesk one of the staff took my bagage and I go directly to departure entrance to get in on the flight to Roxas. When i reached Roxas my baggage was left behind on the airport, and they are saying i will get my luggage by the next day but till now they said my luggage is missing in manila airport.. Till now i didn't get yet my baggage.",1
"It was a early morning flight out of KUL. I was in a group of 10 people going to Radin Inten II airport in Bandar Lampung via CGK. There was a 5-hour stopover in CGK before our next flight to TKG. Overall, the flights were pleasant, but in the inflight sales of food was too simple; no food items were available, passengers were only able to buy water and a piece of cake. During our stopover, we had to carry our luggage from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 of CGK ourselves; Lion Air should have provided us and others with transport while in transit.",0
"Didn't even get to use the flight, paid extra for a changeable fare and when my sister was ill I tried to change the flight to later in the year so that I could still use it and found out that they only post flights 2 months or so in advance so there is no way to use the flight. Waste of JPY 61,063.00. First time I flew with them when I was on the plane I discovered that they didn't provide water and they also would take a debit card so I had to do an 8hr flight with no water. Disgraceful.",1
"Singapore to Bangkok. Soon after take-off, a passenger went to a vacant seat located at the emergency exit (13F) for additional comfort. A Scoot cabin staff went to ask her politely to return to her designated seat and the passenger did. The staff deserves praise to approach the passenger because allowing her to continue seating at the emergency would have compromised safety in case of an unexpected incident as the passenger was not briefed on how to operate the exit door prior to takeoff.  Keep up the good work Scoot.",0
Chiang Mai to Krabi. This is by no means a budget carrier due to their increasing prices. They were the only carrier to offer a direct flight less than two hours (avoiding BKK) but at a cost of almost 300 one way for two people. Thai Bangkok and Nokair all stopped at Bangkok. Nothing given for free on board no entertainment. You got to pay for luggage and I couldn't fathom out how not to pay for their insurance! Better and cheaper fares offered with main airline carriers. Although the flight was straightforward.,1
Flew the Jetstar equivalent of business class this week (SIN-MEL) and was very disappointed hardly any leg room hard uncomfortable seats which do no recline much food quality was poor and selection of on demand movies and TV shows was also severely limited. I asked for a pillow and was told there was a 'blow up one' in the amenities bag. It was an extremely uncomfortable neck pillow and the expected duvet was in fact an old grey blanket. The overall offering from Jetstar just does not come anywhere close to competing with Air Asia's lay flat beds in their Premium Class with pillows and duvets. Jetstar does not even given priority baggage to business class passengers! Definitely not worth paying the extra money stick to economy if flying Jetstar.,1
"I flew AirAsia on 21 April from Singapore to Bangkok DMK. I had encountered some problems with my e-ticket which was quickly rectified with a call to AirAsia's office in Thailand without charges which was really appreciated. The plane coming in was delayed which affected our outgoing flight however there was very inadequate updates. This caused some passengers concerned who could be seen approaching the counter staff. The airline could perhaps put updates on the screen at the boarding area just to allay the passengers' concerns. On this occasion, the screen was showing last-call at 9.05pm for a flight that was scheduled to depart 25 mins earlier that evening at 8.40pm. The flight itself was as expected of a budget carrier. The cabin crew who were mainly Thai were polite, gracious and attentive throughout the flight.",0
"Siem Reap to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. The flight was fine and the staff were nice. We were unaware that checked luggage was not included in the ticket price and as a a result we had to pay 72USD each on the spot to have our bags put on the plane. This has never happened on other flights I've flown. How can they justify charging that much for a bag to be put on the plane? That cost is almost as much as the flight ticket!  Be careful of this little money maker, if you don't check that little box when buying your ticket online you'll be paying through the teeth to bring your luggage.",1
"Very disappointing travel in Jetstar. No organisation or system in place going from Sydney to Cairns, and we nearly missed our flight, and a very low act flying to Sydney from Cairns. As other travellers have mentioned earlier, the crew tried to price gouge from all passengers by weighing in each and every bag including a walking stick. It was not to with safety or comfort but was very price driven as they had a eftpos machine ready to charge customers, for a low cost airfare company, I thought it was a very low act. The crew kept hurdling everyone to move, saying it was a full flight which we later realised it was only 50 percent full. Half the food stock was unavailable too. Jetstar need to get their act together and get away from price gouging , or else they will not survive.",1
"The Jetstar Airways flight from Perth to Gold Coast was delayed by twenty minutes due to late inbound arrival of aircraft but that was no concern. The pilot did say that we would be landing on the dot, early if Gold Coast airport did not have a curfew. This was due to good tailwinds over continental Australia. I sat in 1E and it was just your normal budget airline. The staff were really friendly and clearly trained very well. There is nothing to really complain about, you get what you paid for, a cheap flight. Cheap seats, cheap cabin and no entertainment. The only thing I would say is that they should increase their menu or put more variety on.",0
"Singapore to Kalibo. I will accept bad services, minimal attention, no inflight entertainment and costly additional surcharges. I cannot accept that Scoot cancelled my flight without notification and keeps sending me reminders to check in.  We arrived at the airport, 6 months after planning our 4-day vacation for my friends bachelorette party. There we were told something none of us could have anticipated: Scoot stopped flying to Kalibo or Caticlan long ago. What are we supposed to do then? Why did we received multiple emails leading to the actual day calling us to pack our bags and complete online check in. FYI I was unable to checkin online but didnt thought of it as weird. Those were not the first questions Scoot ground staff or even the call center thought of. Their first question to address: Its not our fault you didnt receive the emails we sent! Let us dig for proof. So it became a contest of proof vs proof. Meaningless and waste of our time. In that time we could have booked a flight to Manila and reach Kalibo by the evening. No, Scoot and their ground staff would like to play a game of lets ignore them till they go away. We were blatantly shunned and no one would attend to us for about one hour while the most responsible person there was busy solving other problems. Even worse, all of the ground staff totally disassociated themselves from Scoot, even as they wear Scoot badges and T-shirts. They told me they cannot make decisions or do anything because they dont work for Scoot - how blatantly they declared that. I wonder if Scoot cares about Customer Service. I really am disgusted by the poor systems, customer service and resource allocation by Scoot. Please avoid using this airline if you can. I cannot advise you how to avoid the same situation I got into. I hope you have better luck if you must fly with them.",1
Sydney to Singapore flight departed on time The food and refreshments could only be described as poor especially for an eight hour flight. The streaming entertainment system was intermittent but content was ok. Public address announcements were inaudible most of the time and the staff service level was poor and they seemed to be good at hiding in the galley. Not what we expect from an airline associated with SQ Not a patch on Jetstar Bus/Star Class.,1
Never again! I had my worst flight experience with Lion Air. After more than 16h of flight from Paris to Jakarta. The flight from Jakarta to Bali had several hours of delay. No information provided.,1
"We flew to Singapore with Scoot in April this year and were quite happy with the service, comfort and even the food! It's a budget airline and good value. I booked online through Scoot's own website and all prices were quoted in AUD. When we wanted to go to Singapore again next year, I didn't hesitate to book with Scoot once again. Their website now quotes prices in Singapore dollars and the booking process continues in this currency. There now appears to be a myriad of extra charges and fees, which are not quoted on the initial page and were not paid on our previous trip but still cheaper than other airlines. When it comes to paying - beware if you are paying in a currency other than Singapore dollars because the conversion is not calculated properly and is majorly in Scoot's favour. I was charged $42 more than the official conversion rate and when I called Scoot to complain, they didn't want to know! I am now so disappointed in Scoot that I will not be using them again.",1
"Ranchi to Kolkata with IndiGo. I travel frequently with this airline, and trust me folks this is the best you can get in terms of value for money compared to other airlines in India. Indigo has been my personal favourite for short flights. The flight crew is fairly good. I'm 6'1, and I find the seat compact but this is the same for all LCCs and not ideal on long flights. Cabin staff appearance is smart, they are courteous but not always consistent. There is no inflight entertainment on these flights. Short flights they are perfect, Medium duration okay, long flights not recommended.",0
Three short flights on Air Asia DMK-RGN RGN-DMK DMK-SGN. All flights via newish A320s. A little chaotic at check in for DMK flights but otherwise the boarding process was easy. Be aware though that they strictly enforce their carry on baggage regulations and I suggest you pay for a checked bag when you buy your ticket and carefully weigh it before check in. Plane interiors clean comfort OK for short flight and service friendly but I hate the banner ads on the luggage bins. Checked bags were delivered promptly on arrival.,0
"Flight TR-019 was scheduled to depart from Melbourne to Singapore at 1.20 pm AEST on the 3rd of February 2020. Due to technical issues they made us stay inside the aircraft while they were working on the issue. For the first, one and a half hours to about 2 hours, the air conditioner was not working, when asked the attendant informed they were experiencing some technical issues. Upon seeing passengers uncomfortable and some literally sweating, they called in technician and set it up. The entire process took about 5 hours and we waited patiently only to be told Melbourne authorities had given a red flag to depart and that we are to disembark only to start the process of standing at the counter all over again. We had to go through immigration and back to check in counter. Now the representatives knew there was another flight flying at 10.30 pm AEST and so their priority was to check-in passengers boarding that flight, while leaving 225 passengers (as told) from cancelled flight stranded at the airport waiting in long queues unattended. I had to wait for 5 hours and 45 minutes for my turn (not even exaggerating). Though I was given two options (if I wanted to take the flight), both the options were delayed by more than 24 hours. What is shocking is that there was a similar incident by the same flight TR-019 just a week before on the 27th of Jan 2020 to be exact. They had to cancel the flight due to technical issues.",1
"I was pleasently surprised by Scoot. I flew from Berlin to Phuket via Singapore. Especially on the long haul flight from TXL to SIN Scoot provides a good product when you consider their low fares. I was sceptical at first after reading some devastating reviews, but Scoot proved them wrong. The 787-8 aircraft they use for the Berlin-Singapore service was very clean and the seats were actually pretty comfortable. Considering the low fare, there was enough legroom, even for a person with 188cm in height. You just have to be aware that you have to pay extra for everything, even a small bottle of water costs 4S$. And you should bring enough entertainment options in form of preloaded Amazon or Netflix videos on board, because there will be no free entertainment system on board of their aircrafts. All in all I can recomend flying with Scoot, when you get a good deal on a ticket.",0
"Most terrible experience and will never fly Lion Air ever again. We booked a return flight from Singapore to Bali via Jakarta and got an email to tell us our flight from Bali to JKT is delayed by an hour which cut our transit time allowance to only 1 hour instead of 2. Initially, we thought even thou rushed, we probably would be able to make it, but we were terribly wrong. When we arrive to JKT, it took us an overpriced cab (airport shuttle never came) and an hour to get from terminal 2 to terminal 3 only to be told by Lion Air staff that maybe we have to go back to terminal 2 to collect our luggage which is total misinformation. They don't even bother to check and they know nothing when you asked them. Thankfully, we did not go back to terminal 2 or else we will probably miss our connecting flight! The Lion Air flight back was even worse. True to what we believe by now, the short 1 hour transit time is definitely not enough. So during our check in at Bali to return to SG, we asked the staff how we can make it within 15 minutes from the flight landing time to the next boarding gate to board at the stipulated time printed on our boarding pass. It is totally impossible. They are not able to give us an answer how they are going to ensure we can make it to the next flight. We had to demand to see the supervisor who told me Icould disagree with the flight changes but that is not true because there is no option I could indicate i disagree with the flight changes and the email about the schedule change only came later after I booked the flight. Finally he said the staff at jkt will be there to fetch us to our connecting flight. And so, flight at Bali was delayed with no information to let the passengers know. We are supposed to board at 3.30pm and we only boarded 2 hours later with no announcements. We had to also change gates for the boarding and again no announcement at all to inform passengers. It was totally chaotic. When we asked if our next connecting flight is delayed since our first leg of flight is delayed and won't reach in time to take the next flight from JKT to SG, Lion Air staff said no which means we will miss the next flight! In the end, they made all the passengers in the connecting flight (those waiting are not connecting passengers) wait for us for 2 hours to board the plane and take off. Food and beverages sold are very limited.",1
"Melbourne to Tokyo Narita via Cairns. I had a choice for the same price, between Cathay Pacific in economy via Hong Kong or Jetstar in business class via Cairns. Jetstar had more convenient timings so I took the chance. Then I panicked because the ticket and the website indicated that I would have to collect my bags in Cairns and check back in. However, at check-in in Melbourne, I was given both boarding passes and my bags were checked through to Tokyo - this seems to be the norm for the Tokyo and Osaka flights but I cant find anywhere where I was told that in advance. A good thing, too, since the Melbourne-Cairns flight left 63 minutes late despite boarding on time (theyve got a reputation to maintain). The flight to Cairns had no business section so I was stuck in economy in an exit row seat, plenty of room but next to the noisy galley and toilets. The Boeing 787s electronically-dimmed windows just dont work in direct sun and my head got very hot and it was impossible to sleep. The quieter engines dont translate into a quieter cabin - seems like some machinery is very loud, perhaps for the higher cabin pressures (the higher pressures may however have reduced the screaming from the usual gaggle of families). On the the Cairns-Tokyo leg I was in the first business row and its directly equivalent to premium economy elsewhere. The seat actually felt less roomy than the Cathay Pacific premium economy I was in a few weeks ago, even though 2x3x2 in a 787 should have more space than 2x3x2 in the narrower A330. The food was fairly good but they offered lower-end alcohol options compared to most airlines. Maybe the busines class is worth considering for a point-to-point long-haul flight (as long as its cheaper than others premium economy), but its still Jetstar.",1
"The flight was delay about 1 hour and no announcement was made early to inform. The flight only took 55 minutes to the destination but the flight delayed for an hour. My appointment in the evening was postponed and delay. Airline, please improve your service.",1
"Check in terrible rude and no idea of customer service. 3 hours delay to to staffing, management issues. Good to get a refreshment voucher but don't appreciate the manner of rude talking to customers.",1
"Everything about this airline is bad! They don't provide food for free and don't accept credit card to pay anything. The seat is very uncomfortable, and the service is bad. The transfer in Manila airport was in a mess. They did not deliver my baggage with me. They refused to deliver the baggage to my address (where I live is very far from the airport). I asked for compensation of my baggage, but they haven't replied to me though many days have passed.",1
"My wife has problems with her knees and has great difficulty with stairs so we notified the person at the counter, they asked can she do stairs, I said no she can not. They said ok and charged us for wheelchair. Then she had a wheelchair brought and said I was to push it. I declined and she sent for someone. We had a layover in Kuala Lumpur and when it was time to board no wheelchair, and a long ramp and then she had to climb stairs anyway. When we arrived in Danang again no wheelchair. And nowhere to contact customer service to get our money back. Never again.",0
"The worst thing about Jetstar is their website. The night before our flight, I decided to book exit row seats. I logged in, got to the seating map, and spent twenty minutes trying to allocate seats with no success. I then spent another fifteen minutes trying to locate a phone number on their website so I could speak with someone who could hopefully help me. I ended up going through Google to find a number, finally speaking with a very helpful man who booked my seats. Whilst online, though no seats had been booked, the website gave me the impression it had debited our credit card anyway, but the very helpful man assured me no money had been taken. Our flight the following morning was fine, if a little early for me (6.10am). Cabin crew were good, the pre-ordered toasted sandwich was hot and tasty, and flight departed on time and arrived early into Cairns. We always fly Qantas, but some routes in Australia are not flown by them, so other carriers such as Jetstar or Virgin have to be used. Jetstar is the preferred option as I can accrue Qantas FF points and status credits. This is my fifth domestic flight with Jetstar, and all flights have been on time and without incident.",0
"Trivandrum to Doha. Terrible experience with booking process and customer service from the airline. We were given wrong information by staff and we were denied boarding for our flight because apparently there was no transfer desk at our transit airport! It cost us our return ticket, unnecessary stress at the airport, and an extra USD $2000 for alternative and last minute flights to make it back home. Upon returning home, we made several attempts to reach management to address our case - the responses were slow (if any) and unprofessional with no attention to our case. We received standard replies and it has been almost a month now since we have received any updates about our complaint.",1
"This airline has the worst customer service. When my flight got cancelled, I was told by the travel agent to contact their Customer service (CS) not knowing that Lion replaced it with a different carrier at the same time. The CS rep didnt tell me this so I changed my flight to another with different timing. After knowing that I could actually take a flight at the same time I contacted CS again but was told that I had to pay the prevailing charges because they can only change free of charge 1x. The worst was when I tried to file a complaint - instead of assisting - a different rep made issues of semantics - saying I asked the wrong questions - hence I got the wrong answer. Isnt it their job to give info and enlighten as well as assist inconvenienced customers?? Safe to say I may never use their services again.",1
Brisbane to Proserpine 17 Apr QF5830 and Proserpine to Brisbane May 19 QF5833. No delays great staff on the ground and onboard. The price of the flight was very competitive and right from the start I was helped by staff at Brisbane I had a boxed cycle with me which was cumbersome and awkward it arrived in perfect condition both ways especially as I hadn't paid any extra for fragile freight. I would recommend.,0
Travelled May 7th Honolulu-Melbourne JQ2 in economy class. Paid +$700 for a one way ticket no food no entertainment no service basically. Was seated on seat 41A armrest between seats was held together by sticky tape. Seats were the most uncomfortable I've ever traveled on. Cabin crew was on the verge of rude and indifferent. Toilets very dirty. The flight was delayed by 3 hrs! Trying really hard to find a positive here but unfortunately nothing positive bout the whole experience. Back to Hawaiian Airlines for sure!,1
JQ3 10 May. We travelled SYD-HON on Sunday 10 May in Business class. Apart from Jetstar's normal rubbish administration (cancelled our original flight and seemed to think that putting us on a flight two days earlier should not even worth discussing) everything else was good. To put it in perspective - you get what you pay for. Sure we could have gone QANTAS or Hawaiian and had better seats but that would have been 3 times the price. We could have gone economy but I'm well over 6 feet and didn't fancy that. So it was a good compromise. It cost us around $1000 each one way (we were getting the ship back) The seats were pretty good (about Premium Economy level) the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent. We would do it again (unless there was a special offer from QANTAS or Hawaiian.,0
Our flight KUL-SGN was forced to return due to a tropical Storm in SGN. That was unavoidable so we accepted that we had no choice. However on return to the LCCT the absence of senior staff and the overall treatment of all passengers was appalling. Passengers were left to fend for themselves and there was a disgraceful lack of communication My wife and I had to make our own way through Immigration to try to find a hotel room. Staff seemed confused and leaderless.,1
"The flight from Berau to Jakarta was in two parts. We flew from Berau to Balikpapan on a ATR 72-500 of Wings Air which was quite comfortable since I got a first row seat and was thankfully on time since there is nothing to do at Berau airport. The check in process was smooth and hassle free. The Balikpapan to Jakarta leg was delayed almost 2 hours, thankfully I had planned a long gap before international connection to Mumbai (to Singapore). The Lion Air leg of the flight was relatively less comfortable and the seats were not very well spaced out, so I would say it was ok but would definitely would not plan a flight with Lion Air if time is critical.",1
I was scheduled to travel on a non-stop Scoot flight from Singapore to Sydney by Business Class a few days ago. The flight was scheduled to take off from Singapore at 1.45am and arrive into Sydney at 12.40pm. The flight got progressively delayed and finally took off around 5.30am. Then for some unknown reason it stopped in Perth before continuing to Sydney. Finally it landed in Sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. I missed my onward connections to Canberra. So moral of the story is that if you have to reach somewhere on time do not travel by Scoot as they are usually late.,1
"Rescheduled flight (Medan to Jakarta) 1 hour later, then another 2.5 hour delay. Lion Air is known to have constant flight delays, cancelations and forced reschedules. Operations seems to be in disarray.",1
"Brisbane to Melbourne. Horrible quality airline with no food and low quality everything, which would be ok, but at the airport and gate you will be harshly checked and overcharged for everything - I just paid $60 for less than 1 kg overweight together with everything. Cheap, if its sharks like Jetstar, cost me at the end more expensive than nice quality Qantas.",1
"I was with a party of 10 with a flight going from Cebu to Phuket via Singapore. Our flight got cancelled due to a damaged tire and some part of the wing. Scoot made sure to house us in one of the best hotels in Cebu nearest to the airport. The next day since we could not make it to our flight frm to phuket, they had us stay at the Crowne Plaza in Changi airport. Although we missed 2 days of our stay in Phuket, we nevertheless had an awesome time together as a family especially with the dinner and breakfast buffet spread we had when we stayed at both hotels. What was supposed to be a case of delays and cancellations turned out to be an unforgettable experience for the whole family. Scoot made sure to take care of us and made it so much easier for us despite the several days of delays due to the connection. it was not their intention to delay or cancel our flight because it was a technical issue and for our safety, it was best not to push the flight on the set original date. We appreciate all that you did to me and my family. This trip became all the more colorful and adventurous because of the efforts you made for us. I sincerely thank you for everything you did for us. Thank you. Customer retention at its best! I am a customer for life with Scoot.",0
"Singapore to Bangkok. This is the worst airline I flew, here was no inflight entertainment you had to pay $4 for water and even worse you couldnt bring your own water on the plane. The seats were uncomfortable with no blankets and pillows.",1
Flew the KUL-CGK on 20 December and CGK-KUL on 4th January. On the sector KUL-CGK the food that I pre-booked was delicious served hot nice and creamy. On the sector CGK-KUL food was served hot and it was awesome. Overall good trip satisfaction. FA's were nice and presented a good service throughout the flight. Will continue to fly AirAsia.,0
Singapore to Langkawi. Scoot is one of the worst airline I have travelled in. The staff is highly unprofessional and at checkin the way staff talk to customers is derogatory. You get a feeling like as if you are flying for free and Scoot is doing you a favour to you by letting you fly with them. Even after complaining to manager about the unprofessional staff there was not a single word of apology or regret from them. This airline spoiled my mood during my holiday. Also at the cost of this airline you can get air Asia or even better airline.,1
"I WOULD NOT recommend Jetstar. Not only did we have to pay for luggage that was over 20kg, we also had to check our expensive camera, drone and go pro because they do not accept anything above 7kg for a carry on! After paying for the baggage allowance! Our luggage did not arrive at our destination. It has been four days since we landed and we still have no update on where our luggage is. We were told that it would be on the next flight which was to land today on December 4th and now we are being told they actually have no way of verifying if it got on the plane. The customer service has been extremely rude and unhelpful. Worst company ever and I will be telling people by word of mouth to not fly with Jetstar.",1
"Singapore to Bangkok. UOB Singapore had a Krisflyer promo where they could waive they credit card booking fee but upon payment the Scoot website will prompt that you must log into your scoot insider account. When you do that they will revoke all UOB Krisflyer benefits, charge you a credit card fee and pretend to give you a ""15% off welcome voucher"" that after applying the voucher the amount will the same as before the voucher with additional of credit card booking fees and extra 5kg baggage fees. I tried calling the call center 6 times each lasted around 1 hour as all the ""let me put you on hold"" and final saying ""we will escalate it and we will get back to you"" then you will never hear from them again. When you call back stating the person you spoke to the person will always be ""busy"" and the whole process repeats itself. Don't fly Scoot because once they get your money, you will only get ignored.",1
"I tried to change my flight booking and even downloaded the mobile app to do it, but the system did not allow me because its within 48 hours of the flight. What kind of rule is that? Plans change, people need to change their flights. I tried to find a contact number for customer service and searched everywhere, but was not able to find one with a live person. All I can find was a complaint line where I had to leave a message. Now I have to leave the ticket as a loss and buy a new one, Im not buying from AirAsia.",1
26 May 2013 Jaipur to Chennai. I saw some dirty used cups and wet tissues in the seat pocket in front of me. I highlighted this immediately to the cabin crew whilst boarding was going on. Told it would be cleaned in the next clearance and nothing could be done at that time. I was shocked and surprised with this answer. The cleaning was done in Ahmedabad by ground staff and then the flight took off for my destination Chennai. On time performance took higher importance over cleanliness and hygiene. The attitude of cabin crew was horrible. I will never fly Indigo again.,1
"Proserpine to Brisbane. Jetstar, thank you for a wonderful stress-free trip on 1st July. I accompanied my 90 year old mother who needed special assistance to get on and off the plane. All staff were friendly and very helpful. And a special thank you to our buggy driver at Brisbane airport. Unfortunately I don't know his name, but he was amazing - so gentle and caring with my mum - I was so impressed!",0
"Cebu to Manila. 5th flight with Cebu Pacific, 5th time there has been a huge problem, 4th flight cancelled with no information, terrible staff communication, no snacks or good food in the flight, chairs are the worst iv sat in. After this last joke I won't be flying with them again.",1
"Only 15 kilograms check in luggage! Charge extra for everything, demanding 200 rupees for not checking online although the link didn't work. Demanded extra for an extra couple of kilos. Not assigning empty seats for customers, rather than cramping them together and leave empty seats at the back empty, just because they didn't pay for these seats! This is unorganised! No food on the plane, Air India was exactly the opposite of this, nice seat, 25 kilos of luggage, which is more than enough, ultra smooth check-in and offered a sandwich and a drink on just 1 hour flight.",1
"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. Good points, beautiful modern Boeing 787, seats better than most premier league airlines, all 4 legs of my return flight left on time and arrived early. Decent and friendly staff. No problem checking in and reasonable wait. Bad points, it is budget so even if you pay the food will be poor, no entertainment, no free glass of water. I am used to deleting all add ons but no escape from Scoot, though even if you only have hand bag, nor $20 booking fee, add a cabin bag and $230 is 330+, and for one leg I even paid for unwanted insurance. Still cheaper than the premier league but now 2/3rd price not 1/2. I feel Singapore Airlines heart is not in it, both good and bad. Web page seems unreliable.",0
When we decided to fly from Cebu to Caticlan (Boracay) we were hesitant to fly Cebu Pacific because of horror stories we heard but opted to give it a chance. We booked and purchased our ticket 3 months in advance. Between that date and the flight date Cebu Pacific called 3 times to change the time of departure. The worst thing happened when they called 6 days before the actual flight date and told us the flight would be cancelled and they would fly us to Kalibo (3 hours away from Caticlan by bus). The airline rep tried to appease us by providing a free bus ride from Kalibo to Caticlan however this would mean we would arrive in Boracay past 7pm instead of the original schedule of 3pm. This in effect wasted 1 entire day and meant we paid for 1 night's hotel stay which was useless. Having no other recourse we agreed but to our horror upon arriving in Kalibo the bus they prepared from Kalibo to Caticlan was not big enough to accommodate all passengers. They had to fit all 13 of our group into 1 small van. Needless to say we have all vowed to never fly this airline again.,1
"Jetstar cancelled my 10am then 1pm flights, then tried to throw me on the 21.30. I called to rebook for the following day and they said if I change again I'll be charged! Seems it's okay for them to muck you around but if you can't fit in then they bill you.",1
Short 1h20 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Phuket departed and arrived on time. I wouldn't complain much here as the fare was very low ($30 USD) but the seats are not very comfortable (for a short flight I guess it's fine). No entertainment system. The cabin crew was ok. The only drawback for this flight really was the extremely strong AC: bring a down jacket!,0
Indigo flight scheduled at 9:30am from Hyderabad to Ranchi has been delayed 3 hours 30 minutes on December 25th 2017. I am still not sure how long it would take me to finally board my flight today. I have a family event to attend but I think I won't be able to attend it.  It would be a customer delight if airline respects passengers valuable time and value for money. I have been a valued indigo customer but today I am sorry to say indigo customer centric ideologies are fading away these days.,1
"The staff from the check in was rude, nobody smile. The stewardess also  rude, she shouted few times because my son slept on an empty row, somehow the manager came and said its  okay since its an empty seats. It seems Jetstar  hire or train rude people to work as their staff.",1
"Did a round trip with Cebu Pacific, Davao - Cebu - Davao. The trip was on time in both directions. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The fare was great value. I would fly with them again. If I did have any complaints it would have been checking in at Davao. It was a shambles, however we managed to board on time.",0
"For the price, this short flight to Launceston was value for money. Although we had a small delay, the comfort of the Melbourne Airport Domestic terminal, made up for the 1 hour delayed flight (something that seems to be a common thread when flying Jetstar). Expect nothing fancy or over the top and you should have a good time when flying Jetstar.",0
"Sydney to Launceston. Yet again, Jetstar cannot get their act together. Every time I travel with them there is either a safety problem or other issue. Dont travel with this airline.",1
Worst airline by far. Worst experience so many delays and no contingency plans. No communication and their refunds or reimbursement are appalling. Never ever am I ever flying with Jetstar. Quite frankly they shouldnt even fly international because the flight is not equipped for it.,1
"Sydney to Gold Coast. Due to sandstorm in November 2018, more than 40 flights have been cancelled. My boyfriend had to go with an another airline in GC for a big Pacific tournement. Unfortunately they delayed our friday night flight to sunday flight at Sunday. It was too late for the tournament. So we went to Jetstar counter and asking if they had a flight before sunday morning. The man said 'we have a flight at 6'. We buy it directly in cash $821 for a one way only. He printed the boarding pass and on the path, we saw boarding time was at sunday 6pm not 6am. My boyfriend has directly saw the man, who said 'I told you it was 6pm not am'. As they were a huge queue, we decided to line up and wait for our turn. After 20 minutes of waiting, it was almost our turn, the man left its office and a women replaces him. We explained her our story and asked for a sooner flight. She said that this is impossible, all flights are booked. So we asked for a refund. She said that they don't make refunds, only credit voucher. As we are french, I explained that there were a misunderstanding, that we bought flights less than an hour, the money is still in the cash register, the cash is our holidays budget. So she went to see the man and her manager. After few minutes, she came back and confirm us that we can't be refund and there is no credit voucher either because the tickets are not refundable. So we lost $821, we didn't take the plane. They could take advantage of this situation and could propose these tickets for other people. Since the airport was full of people which their flights have been cancelled too. The salesman were not helpful at all, not comprehensive, mostly that we are french and it was a communication mistake. We will never fly with them.",1
"Singapore to Sydney via Cairns. Worst airline ever. Removed foam from seats so you can feel knees of passenger behind you in your spine. They Make you pour out or throw out water bottles at gate, then they charge for water on flight. If you go over 7kg baggage allowance by a small amount, they wont let you take out a jacket to wear/reduce weight; $60 fee. Do not fly.",1
"DEL-TRV Nov 11. My first Indigo flight. As budget airlines go excellent! Actually strike ""budget""! You get what you pay for and you know what you're paying for and Indigo delivered to a T and with aplomb. New clean airy decor aircraft lovely FAs. And a lovely touch that others could copy: no jetway but instead of steps up they have a ramp so it's easy to get rollers up to the plane. Spent half an hour on the ground at Cochi during which the cabin was well-cleaned (lavatories included) and properly vacuumed. Compare that to Ryanair!",0
"When doing the online web check in, I was pleased to note that since I had booked using a corporate fare, the seat selection was free and also I was entitled to 1 complementary snack onboard the flight. The baggage drop process was smooth although due to huge queues at Bangalore airport, the IndiGo staff quickly collected all the bags from the pax in a separate queue which allowed quick deposit of the bags. Boarding started on time and I learnt that for the complementary snack, there was a choice of upma / poha for veg items and chicken noodles for the non veg items along with the choice of a beverage (hot / cold). The sandwiches could not be availed as part of a CPML booking as I found out but the quantity of the items was on a generous side which was appreciated. The flight landed also on time at Kolkata, however the baggage took some time before coming. In the end, I got more for what I paid for including free seat selection and a complementary meal, and got safely to my destination on time. Cannot ask for anything more.",0
"Flew Scoot during their special collaboration with Pokemon where they sold merchandises like tote bags and bucket hats at rather high price tags. Ordered them anyway as my brother loves Pokemon. On the flight back to SG on 19 Dec 2022, they were supposed to pass me the tote bag that U ordered, but did not, and I forgot to ask them for it as well. I realised it after reaching back home, and sent them an email + made many calls to enquire about it over a 4-month period as they could not give me a response on it. Now, in Apr 2023, I finally received an outcome from them, only to be told that they cannot give me a refund nor the merchandise as all items were claimed on the flight. Worse still, sent me twice of the same thing when I asked for a justified response before radio silent like they did in the past few months. Totally speechless, as I did not receive any goods from them during my flight back.",1
"A terrible level of service and I flew premium. If all you're looking for is cheap fly them. Normally I travel with all my gear, but I had forgotten ear plugs. But never again.",1
"Jakarta to Singapore. A Scoot stewardess acted so condescending. Flight departed a bit delayed, I had an urgent appointment right after the flight, hence when my carry-on baggage was placed in a row behind me I wasn't happy because if my baggage was behind me then when disembarking I had to wait for all other passengers to go before me. If my baggage is located at any row in front of me, during disembarking I could follow the flow of movement of other passengers. I explained this to her, asking either one of these, I to move to any seat behind the row where my luggage was located, or my baggage to be moved to any free space in the compartment at any row in front of me. She said, ""there's nothing I can do"" and she pointed out that it's not her job to move my bag. What kind of attitude she had. To me, fly Scoot last.",1
"Flight attendant, George was very considerate to promptly change available front seats for us upon seeing my elderly mother struggle to walk. Appreciate the thoughtfulness.",0
Melbourne to Sydney. No longer a cheap airline. Bad customer service and rip-off when it comes to cabin baggage. $65 dollars for 2 kilograms over in cabin baggage is wrong wrong wrong. Better to fly Virgin or Qantas.,1
"I had planned a trip a few months ago however due to covid and border restrictions closing for QLD I am unable to travel next week. I had advised the agent about this however she showed no compassion or sympathy and offered ""travel credit"" as an option and said due to policy reasons they were not be able to change this. I am sickened by their policies that put people further into financial hardship.  I will never be travelling with them again.",1
The flight was very pleasant. I enjoyed it but AirAsia should consider add the in-flight entertainment packages to the flight.,0
"Awesome hospitality by Air hostess, a member of family had a health issue and she really took very good care of her. Overall experience was amazing, loved to fly with indigo",0
My partner and I were scheduled to fly from Singapore to Jetstar on the 2.20am flight. On arrival at Singapore Changi Airport we saw that the flight was listed as 'cancelled'. We proceeded to speak with ground staff who denied any knowledge of flight cancellation. We proceeded to check in and entered the departure gates. 2 hours prior to departure it was announced that the boarding gate had been changed. We went to this new gate number but there was no sight of any boarding or ground staff. All this while the flight was listed as 'cancelled' on the information board. Ground staff repeatedly assured us the flight was scheduled for departure as planned. We waited an hour and a half 20 minutes prior to scheduled departure another passenger arrived to inform us he has confirmation that the flight had been cancelled. At no point did a Jetstar staff member approach passengers to announce this. We were left to seek out the Jetstar information counter at which point the counter manned by 2 young and inexperienced staff members were swarmed by hundreds of passengers. It was almost 2 hours before we were able to speak with a staff member who informed us 'they would place us on the next available flight - which could possibly be the flight on the following day or even a few days down the road if a seat could not be secured.' Shocking and utterly disgraceful.,1
"By far the worst flight experience I have had in my life. Customer service was rude, plane was uncomfortable. This was the last leg of my journey from America to India and I will be sure to never fly Indigo again. At least some of the lower service staff tried to be helpful, but the manager of the Bangalore Indigo crew  was the most unhelpful, rude, entitled person I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. I have never been treated so poorly by someone in the service industry and I hope Indigo realizes that this one person has cost them many customers.",1
Round-trip from Goa to Bangalore on 29 April 2015. Later when I heard many bad reviews about Air Asia I was worried. But when I travelled all flights were on time. Crew were polite. Service was good.,0
"Bali to Bangkok. Chaos at check in counter in Bali! The counter opened late and passengers were nervous. There were many flights leaving around the same time, passengers from earlier flights tried to skip the queue and go first making other passengers furious. There were no sign indicating which flight should check in first and which flight later, so passengers clustered everywhere in front of check in counters. Very unpleasant experience.",1
I was weary of this airline because of my previous experience flying in from Manila last July 2022. However ground crew Cheska changed it all. She managed to make our check in from Dumaguete to Manila quick and efficient. Her loyalty and hard work deserves recognition.,0
"I had a morning flight of 8:30 am from Ahmedabad to Lucknow. I reached the airport at 7:25 am and was standing in the IndiGo line for check-in. Around 7:32 am, the IndiGo lady asked where I was going and other few passengers as well. When we informed her that it was Lucknow, the lady removed us from the line informing us that the counters had been closed at 7:30. She was very stubborn and was not ready to listen or even guide us on what to do next. The next 20 min just flew by running from indigo counter to counter. The lady on the reservation counter didn't even inform me of the fact that if a customer missed their flight and books it via their counter the fee charged is Rps 1800 and the PNR given is the same. A customer doesn't need to restart their booking again. Luckily my husband guided me on this procedure to which the lady confirmed.",1
"We have used Scoot before and highly recommended them previously. Now with our cruise cancelled we have firstly asked for voucher refund to use later this year. As with the uncertainty of travelling this year we emailed for our cash refund instead. No response, we only got ""we will get back to you within 10 working days"" - nothing!. A phone call to them 1 month later and after 40 minutes of back and forth on hold with customer service we were told no you cannot change it. We asked for reasoning and to have a response in writing as verbal communication was difficult, and nothing .. so disappointing that they treat previous clients this way!",1
Sydney - Melbourne/Avalon and return. Used Qantas lounge in SYD a big plus. Offered exit row seats at baggage drop/check-in both ways so the otherwise tight seat pitch wasn't an issue. Both flights pretty much on time and Avalon is a breeze to use compared to MEL. Orderly efficient boarding procedure and baggage delivery. Staff all polite and competent.,0
"Singapore to Adelaide via Denpasar. I was very disappointed with total lack of service on these flights. There was no complimentary food or drink, no pillow or blanket, no entertainment, no WiFi and no leg room. We have travelled on many ""budget"" airlines and they offer a full service. These Jetstar flights were not that cheap in comparison. Adding to this they were the only flights from our trip which included 1p flights that were delayed.",1
"Flew on AK700 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was delayed due to the congestion at Changi Airport, but we arrived at Kuala Lumpur just on schedule. Refreshments were available for purchase at decent price on this short flight. I got a cup noodle for MYR8 which is around US$1.81. Flew on AK713 from Kuala Lumpur back to Singapore. We arrived Singapore 15 mins ahead of schedule. The service of the staff is commendable, and it would be perfect if the legroom can be bigger. Overall, I prefer AirAsia as my first choice to Kuala Lumpur, for its cheap price and reputation of world's best low cost carrier.",0
Travelling this airlines has been a very stressful experience and I would never take a flight with them again. The staff and managers at Nagpur airport were very slow and didnt respond to our queries when we said it was an emergency situation very early in the morning nobody was helpful in that situation. Think twice before booking this airline.,1
Bengaluru to Bali via Malaysia. Worst international flight I have ever travelled. No meals even after paying thousands of bucks for the flight. Flight seats are horrible. I would not prefer travelling in AirAsia.,1
"Sydney to Hong Kong via Singapore. Fantastic experience on both routes - a very good welcome, cabin crew happy and very attentive to requests. Food was better than my husband and I have experienced on other airlines of equal standard in Economy. The seats were very comfortable and yes, there were no shutters on the windows, but a button under each window which has a way to darken the window itself. We had a brilliant experience and to our way of thinking, anyone who gives the airline a thumbs down, must be very hard to please.",0
SYD - MEL on JQ1. Boarding delayed and rushed causing departure from the International Terminal to be 40 mins late. Although it was a sale fare the service was poor and communication with passengers was limited. Seats were uncomfortable and narrow and the selection of food and drinks was minimal. The landing was terrible and even resulted in some applause from the passengers! I'll stick to Virgin or Qantas from now on - and I wouldn't even consider JQ International after this experience.,1
"First off, Im not a picky flyer by any means. I only get up from my seat to stretch occasionally and always bring my own entertainment options, no matter what is offered in-flight. I dont need a lot of space or amenities to be content, even though Im not a small guy. That was the initial attraction to ZIPAIR for me, not paying for things I wasnt going to use. Entertainment? Bring your own (every seat has a USB-A charging port and they allow power banks, so dont sweat the electrons). Meals, snacks, and drinks? Offered, but must be paid for separately either before you board, or in-flight via a browser interface using the planes WiFi system. Honestly, fine with me. I brought my own snacks and water on board, and used WiFi to order some drinks. The flights were incredibly smooth, the cabin staff were a vision of professionalism and care, the planes were spotless, and the seat comfort was better than expected despite being in Economy. For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty. Honestly, these are relatively minor complaints (especially WiFi, hardly a necessity), and I feel these in no way diminished the value of what I saved on my fare. To sum up: I kept my expectations simple, and was thoroughly content with my experience flying with ZIPAIR. I will be using them again the next time I go to Japan.",0
"My partner and I flew with Jetstar on Wednesday to Sydney from Melbourne. We were 3 mins late to the check-in time. We spoke to floating staff member and she said we will need to go to the customer service desk- she couldn't care less. We explained to the lady what happened and she said ""It's out of my control"" told us we needed to pay $80 to get on the next flight. The flight was delayed by 30 mins. Spoke to the live customer service line and tried to get a refund for the difference we paid they said there is nothing they can do and they are still abiding by their legal terms. I said your customer service is appalling! You don't even care about your customers. Jetstar you are appalling.",1
"Cebu to Davao. The cabin impression is very clean and modern. I got seat 4F. The seat was quite comfortable. Legroom was okay. The flight was slightly delayed. The pilots and crew apologised for the delay, they were very friendly. For the price you are paying for, it is worth it!",0
"Really bad airline start to finish. Check in under staffed, no social distance control and rude ground staff. We booked a flight together but when we got our tickets they put us in Seat A and C with gap of middle seat. They told me the flight was full and we had no choice. I pointed out that no one likes to sit in the middle seat, so why not give them the window or aisle, so we as a couple are together. They were rude and says that's our allocated tickets. We will never travel AirAsia again.",1
I paid a large amount of money for what is a 6 hour flight from Tokyo to Bangkok. The very least they can do is include food! I should not have to pay extra just to get a meal. Ive been on many flights and every single one includes food if longer than 5 hours. Terrible.,1
ZERO OUT OF 100. Worst airline I have ever flown. Nothing on time. Nothing organized. Was selectively pulled out to have bags weighed and charged more. Extra 900 pesos for a carry on that weighed 8kg. Flight was delayed at every stop. Didn't arrive to catch our transport in Puerto Princesa on time. Then again leaving the flight was delayed an hour. Still sitting here as a matter of fact. Philippines Airlines and Cebu Pacific both moving smooth on either side of us.,1
"I booked with Cebu Pacific a flight from Manila to Siargao. I paid extra for my surfboard equipment. In Manila they charged me again for my surfboard, saying that what i booked wasnt for surfboard but for extra luggage when there is no other option in their website! Same happened to my way back from Siargao to Manila. I ended up paying my surfboard 4 times. No refund whatsoever. Never flight with this airline, they will rip you off.",1
"Singapore to Perth. First time trying on Scoot. The seat space for Scoot is small and there does not provide any in-flight entertainment. i understand that as it is Singapore budget air. However, in this 5 hours flight, the temperature in flight is about 28-30 as it gets a bit suffocate, thus, create a great discomfort. other than that, this is what expected for a budget air.",0
"We took flight TR809 from Tokyo to Singapore. The cabin crew were fantastic and attentive. I did notice that the cabin luggage compartment was covered with a layer of dust. In the aircon vent, you could also see stains.  There was a delay landing into Singapore because of busy traffic but we couldn't hear the pilot's announcement. It would be good if they could increase the volume for the pilot's announcement. Because we could not land in Singapore on time, the aircraft went in circles for nearly an hour.",0
Flights were on time and that's about the only good thing I've experienced with this airline. Throughout my Southeast Asia journey I flew Air Asia 4 times and each time had a terrible time booking and then with customer service. Their website is a hassle to navigate and there is so many extra fees! They randomly cancel flights and rebook you without checking then when you have to rebook that flight the website doesn't work and there are no phone numbers to be found. They say they can only help you through live chat but it never works. At one point we resorted to going to the airport and talking to them where they admitted they had read out emails and just did not reply. I've never seen an airline less flyer friendly. Good thing they're cheap. Never flying air Asia again.,1
"Manila to Singapore. I had pretty low expectations for this flight/airline after seeing many negative reviews after I already booked but it was a good no frills flight. The cabin staff that I was with were all professional, kind and efficient. Can't say enough good things about them. Honestly, I was kind of annoyed with the ground crew though. For the to SG flight, the ground crew were bordering talking down to the people trying the board (I get any group can be hard to deal with when not following instructions but you need to have some sort of control and courtesy). They called for first row, seniors, board me first. I was in the first row so I went yet the lady kept raising her voice and telling me later. I pointed out the seat number and told her to look at everyone tickets first. For the back to MNL flight, the ground crew just seemed inconsistent and rushed, eventually giving up on the section style bordering and just took everyone. It is what it is. As one can expect from a budget airline, there is no IFE and the food is not included. I found the menu very very pricey though even knowing their strategy. No problem with the seats since I got the stretch seats, I think it's worth it for big taller people(around $20-25) even for a short 3 hour flight. This is probably your best bet if your usual airline has no convenient flight for your next destination",0
"I had worst experience of my life with this airline. Greedy airline, worst and rude staff. Charged me for small handbag. I even called them to confirm weight etc and still they charged me 75 AUD for my small handbag. Staff member was so rude and ill mannered. Jet star should teach the staff members about how to show manners in front of customers.",1
MEL-HNL JQ 1 in business class. Only negative was the old domestic business style seat. It gets a bit uncomfortable during a long flight. Cabin crew did a good job food was ok and there was plenty of it. IFE on iPad a bit limited. Left on time and arrived early. Overall a very good flight.,0
"Indigo Mumbai to Delhi return. The outward journey started with a smooth and easy check in at Mumbai. Flight on time. The aircraft was clean and as per Indigo standards. What was very poor on this flight was the crew. The leading stewardess in particular seemed to sit and do not much while the other crew worked. Shame to see Indigo crew standards falling. It was also a morning flight but they had none of the breakfast options available - Ramen noodles were my best option. Return flight had a great crew but the Delhi airport check in was a nightmare. Long lines, people cutting lines. No Indigo crew to help. Quite a disappointing and sad experience. The days of looking for Indigo flights to book may be over.",1
"It's so nice to welcome back AirAsia after almost a 2 years absence since the start of the pandemic. After having had a few bad experience with Malaysia airlines quite recently. I chose Air Asia for the value of money. On Christmas day, flight was on time. Check in at the airport was orderly, premium flex customers perks and priority were observed. Boarding by the zone was very orderly also. Plane is clean and crew were lovely and welcoming. It really pays to get the exit row for the extra leg room and comfort. My pre-ordered meal of Bukhara chicken rice was delicious ad spicy, and it came with a small bottle of water. I was impressed at how efficient the crew worked, and they kept the 2 toilets clean at regular intervals as well. Landing was so smooth too. Luggage delivered in a timely manner and in good condition. For someone who is used to flying premium airlines in business class, I must say this was a very inoressive experience. I think in future for medium to short haul flights, I really don't mind to fly with them and save some money as well. Maybe party is also because, nowadays, many premium airlines cut costs so much that, more and more, they resemble budget airlines, except for the price tag.",0
MEL-HNL return. Return trip was via Sydney. Pre-booked catering and entertainment. Had a spare seat next to me both ways which helped. Seat standard for economy. Ipad entertainment was fine. Food was barely fit for human consumption and not worth a cent - take your own on board. Check in at Melbourne long and arduous and a bad way to start a holiday! Return flight was delayed in both HNL and SYD making for a very long trip.,0
"Adelaide to Bali via Sydney. The flight was cancelled by Jetstar, but they refused to refund it and gave a (useless, since I won't come back to a region where Jetstar flies in the next years) voucher instead. Very bad experience, non-existing support, 'chat-robots' that (if you should reach out for one) only say 'we are sorry but we can not change anything'.",1
Afternoon departure from Chennai to Mumbai. Flight delayed but informed well in advance. Easy Check in. The aircraft was spotlessly clean. They managed to turnaround the aircraft in 20 minutes. Saw passengers disembarking from the previous flight at the same time when we were bussed to the aircraft which I thought was quite amazing. The cabin crew were very professional and took time to individually ask passengers on the feedback about the flight and quality of service. Will fly them again.,0
"Clean, big and spacious, I love this aircraft! Normally for short-haul flights, budget airlines would use smaller airplanes with 3-3 seat arrangement. However, for this trip from Hong Kong to Singapore, we managed to sit in Scoot's Boeing 787 with the 2-3-2 seat arrangement. It was very spacious and clean. Staff were friendly. Seat was very comfortable, I slept during my 3 hours journey. No delay, no lost baggage which are good news. And like other budget flights, there were no meals or inflight entertainment. However, these could be purchased on board. Would highly recommend Scoot for short haul flights for price, service and comfort.",0
"Manila to Kota Kinabalu. Up to now I enjoyed to fly with Cebu Pacific because of the low price.The planes are new, however, most of the flights are delayed. The reason might be the overcrowded airport in Manila. Right now I am fighting with them for the refund of a cancelled flight. They said that they refunded the fare to my credit card but it never arrived there. E-mails or Twitter to the customer service are answered with standard phrases which are in no context to the problem. Right now they ignore all e-mails. So I think I have to go there with a lawyer to get my money back. I will never use their services again.",1
Flew one-way KUL-LGW and managed to get standby upgrade from economy to Premium via the Optiontown service. Though notification of successful upgrade only came through via email some 8 hours before the flight. Not best but for the low price it was worth it. 14 hrs flight to LGW was fine. Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine. Will fly Air Asia X again in future.,0
"Perth to Singapore with Scoot. The plane looks very new and clean. I believe the mood lighting does help a bit. Cabin crew were friendly and ground crew were efficient and friendly as well. The flight left on time and got into Singapore early. I have taken Scoot a few times and each time it did not disappoint. In my opinion, they have the best flight time leaving Perth to get to Singapore on each day.",0
"I have flown Air Asia 8 times between CGK-SIN-CGK I have been on-time once. Regardless of price this is unacceptable. Each delay has been from 30 minutes to 3 hours and this is with good weather. I always pick a hot seat exit row. The pitch is fine but it's still tight. Crew's for the most part are friendly. They seem to be getting the Lion air attitude. ""Yea were late so what"". Anyway I'm heading back to Singapore Airlines. Yes it's more money but the delays are out of control at Air Asia.",1
Bangkok-Phuket one-way economy Oct 2012. Price was a little more than I expected (about US$120) but online booking payment and seat selection was very easy. Flight departed on time and cabin crew seemed very determined to get everyone to destination as quickly and comfortably as possible. You pay for everything including water but food and drinks prices were very low. Seats reasonably comfortable. Overall satisfactory flight and I would fly them again.,0
SIN-CGK-SIN. Booking is to the point. Unlike other carriers offering you - upgrades for baggage allowance better seat inflight meal and so on. 1hr delay is normal especially in CGK on evening flight. Seat pocket is dirty and not cleaned from the previous leg. Overall recommended if what you are looking for is just to get from point A to point B.,0
"I booked my flight to Kuching from Singapore and this is not the first time Ive flown with scoot. Dont expect good service. We arrived at least 3 hrs early, asked if we could be moved to the front a little bit and got a front seat. Everything went well until theyve decided to take that back and moved us 20 seats to the back with a condescending tone in front of all of the customers shouting whether weve paid for the front seat or not. So regardless whether Ive purchased this seat or not, Ive still paid for my ticket.",1
I was pleasantly surprised by Scoot. I was in the middle section where kids are not allowed which was lovely as there were about 10 down in coach who all cried at the same time poor parents. I had the upgrade with food blanket and tablet to watch movies. Didn't use the blanket and eye mask as day time and food was too salty to eat. Staff were good and toilets were cleaned a number of times during the flight which was good. I would fly with them again and recommend.,0
ADL-DPS-MEL. Bought Jetstar tickets through Qantas as it was seemingly the only way to get sensible domestic connection from CBR. Price was nothing special. Bags were bang on 20kg if not a whisker over but a blind eye was shown which was a relief. They didn't weigh hand luggage at the gate. ADL-DPS sector was on a domestic A320 which was old dirty and the magazines in our seats were all torn. The seats were either developed by a bus builder or just stuffed judging by our numb behinds for the 5-hour flight. Crew fine and I gather ADL based. Disappointingly half the menu was unavailable as tragic as the choices are - they really aren't trying it really is lowest common denominator and undrinkable wine. DPS-MEL sector was on new B787 with Australian pilots but all Thai flight attendants. New Denpasar Airport is excellent very efficient even if the air con is a bit changeable. You can buy duty free (unlike other ports in Asia on flights to Aus?) which is bagged and given to you at the gate. First time on 787 and the big windows and nicer cabin humidity/pressure seemed to make a difference. I got a good sleep couldn't complain too much about seat or pitch. I would do short haul 787 with Jetstar for the right price I again but keep my underlying disdain for this business model and airline.,1
Manado to Makassar and to Jakarta. Nothing was offered on the first leg not even a cup of water. We did not see the crew at all. On the 2nd leg only 1 cup of water given and a small selection of snacks for sale after that. Again your don't see the crew at all after distribution of items. Disembarkation through the rear exit while the stewardess stood leaning against the wall with her arms folded. The only good thing about the flight and airline was that it was on time the seating was really very cramped.,1
"We had a thoroughly unpleasant experience checking in for a Scoot flight at Singapore Changi Airport. We had already checked in online, and arrived at the airport to collect physical boarding passes and drop-off luggage. When we arrived, we were unable to print the boarding passes at the automated stations and approached several counter staff for help. Instead of assisting us, we were repeatedly told to ""just queue"". However, when we reached the front of the queue, we were told that check in for our flight had closed and refused to let us board. They referred us to another counter, where we were blamed for not approaching them earlier and were again refused boarding. We finally escalated the issue to a manager, who realised that we had already checked in online and needed to get to the gate quickly for boarding. We rushed over and made our flight. Although we made our flight, our Scoot experience was a complete nightmare. The counter staff were unhelpful, unpleasant and in desperate need of proper training.",1
"Brilliant daytime flight out of Gold Coast to Singapore with Scoot. We paid so little for this flight and he aircraft was new, the staff were lovely, and the food was good. Probably would not like to sleep in the seats but daytime is just great. This airline is such value for money with new aircraft and great routes.",0
"Singapore to Perth with Scoot. Flight to Perth delayed by 3 hours due to tragic circumstances on inward flight. Boarding crew handling information to outgoing passengers facing the delay, delivered in a very sensitive, respectful and compassionate way. Top marks to all crew involved.",0
I have flown with them 4 times recently for 3 work meetings and 1 weekend trip. On each occasion my flight schedule was changed at the very last minute usually by 4+ hours. One change even involved me having to swap a direct flight for one with a layover in Bali with 1 day's notice. This flight was again changed on the evening before the flight. On arrival in Singapore for a connecting flight to Bali I discovered my luggage had been completely destroyed due to a heavy oil leak (not from within my bag) and having been crushed by other heavy luggage. The call centres could not be more unhelpful if they were staffed by a group of chimpanzees with typewriters.,1
"Worst experience ever with an airline when It comes to hassles and changes. Flights from KL to Langkawi delayed. I received an email whilst at the airport getting ready to check in saying delayed. My original return flight from Langkawi to KL was cancel and we were bumped back over 2 hrs to a later flight. Then that flight was delayed after we checked in. Then to add insult to injury, the Air Asia flight going to KL that was scheduled for a later departure ended up flying out before my earlier flight. Then if you try to lodge a complaint about the service it is all virtual response now. Seriously such lousy service and terrible airline. I truly regret booking with Air Asia. Next time I will look for any other airline before I ever book with Air Asia again.",1
MEL-SIN return. We chose not to pay extra for mileage credits. We sought legroom and we got it. The seat width was suitable. We needed a wheelchair and pusher at all travel terminal areas as they had slopes difficult joining lips & pushing distances beyond what I am capable of doing. Jetstar assisted with a wheelchair on the outward leg. Only after much discussion did we get 'pusher' assistance on arrival in Singapore. When this came it was an excellent 'local service' - a gratuity was not begrudged. For frequent travellers being a continuing Qantas Club member as I am was wise. In Singapore they arranged the 'pusher' service to our return gate. Sadly at both check-ins knowledge by Jetstar staff about Business Class Max rights plus those of Qantas Club Members was either nil or misinformed. It was a bad start later righted by Qantas Club Staff at both lounges. The in light food choices were acceptable. No problems with the complimentary liquor nor level of service table decor or travel amenities supplied. Seat back lowering by the person in front was a concern on both flights as we had to disturb those persons when we wished to move about. Our outward seats were in Row 6  the last in Business Class with restricted but acceptable lowering for a day flight not suitable if overnight. The Jetstar web-site would not let me pre-select a seat if you had asked for wheelchair assistance as we had - it was one or the other and this is unsatisfactory. On return I opted to select Row 4 to fully recline. In this position the seat is not a fully reclining sleeper- footrest space is insufficient. With a 2-3-2 configuration in this cabin I would not choose the middle seat of a fully occupied 3. We were fortunate both ways in not having a full cabin thus no problem with overhead storage but a number of the compartments were taken up with staff bags and service items-not good. Ours were Jetstar stop-over flights in Singapore as part of flying to/from China thus and correctly there were helpful Chinese & English speaking flight attendants however the level of English could have been better. In reading some of the adverse comments about Jetstar Business the benefits provided compared to cost is being ignored. It is a precious approach to compare Jetstar to a 'full service' airline. I would fly Jetstar Business/Star Class again.,0
"Sydney to Honolulu. Worst airline in the world. Had ordered meals and paid for meals which they did not have on board when we flew. The so called customer care person emailed to apologise and provided vouchers which are not transferable, have to be used in six months and have a host of other conditions which makes them very hard to use. Also he has failed to respond to any emails we have sent. The complaint was taken by the stewardess onboard, so they just sent an email with excuses and then sent these worthless vouchers and ignored all other correspondence. Jetstar are quick to take your money for pillows, meals, entertainment etc but do everything to ensure they don't give you a refund in cash. They send these highly conditioned vouchers which clearly you will have little chance of using so they don't provide the service and then also keep your money! Don't fly with Jetstar.",1
Kolkata-Jaipur route on time clean aircraft and nice crew. One bad thing about this airline is that they do not even serve water at free. Snacks were expensive outside foods are allowed.,0
"JKT-KUL. Flight was slightly behind schedule pre-booked a meal that tasted delicious. Flight attendants were in a good mood and the senior FA wished us ""happy Sunday and god bless you"". That made my day. Was on board the new plane. Looked very clean and the plane look liked it had been cleaned regularly.",0
Very congested and suffocating. They are weighing every piece of hand luggage. Weighers are rude and rushing to pay as they finishing shift or something. Happened before too.,1
Denpasar to Jakarta. The flight was 90 minutes late with no information posted we had to keep asking about it. The gate area was covered in trash left by previous passengers. On our flight coming here they boarded from the front and back of the plane with no distinction for row numbers so people were pushing from both directions with attendants futilely waving people along. It has been a terrible experience all around. Pay extra for Garuda.,1
Two flight delays from Melbourne airport in two days of travel is pretty poor service. Very disappointed in the staff at service desks who were uninterested in passenger concerns. Will never flight Jetstar again better off spending a little extra for a more reliable service.,1
"This airline has never disappoints me even though you dont get free meals, however I had booked my meals and they were very tasty and also their check in and hand baggage allowance is similar to that of many full service carriers and their on time performance puts other airlines to shame. The one hour flight from jaipur to Lucknow was on time and landed 5 minutes before arrival time. The ground staff was courteous and so was the cabin crew with genuine smile.",0
"Flying return from Perth to Melbourne. Our initial flight was due to leave at 10am only to receive an email the night before at 9pm informing our plane had been cancelled due to ""scheduled maintenance"" we had to very quickly rebook ourselves onto a plane that left at 12.45am or 1pm the next day. We were lucky to get seats on the 12.45am flight however the seats at the very back of the plane ""designated for cabin crew."" Because this is a budget airline we really didn't expect many thrills but the back seats allow for little room to recline and the three seats in a row are so compact it was the most uncomfortable experience I've had on a plane. The seats are like cement the faux leather is super sticky and the leg room is ridiculously tiny if you are larger than a size 14 I'm sure you would be terribly claustrophobic. The cabin crew also burnt the coffee which stunk out the entire cabin. Luckily for us this flight did get us in to Melbourne 8 hours earlier than we had first booked so a small positive to say the least. On our return journey from Melbourne to Perth - only four days later - we were due to board the plane having been called over the speaker to get our boarding passes ready to then be told over the speaker that ""we think the plane has been cancelled."" We had to quickly run out to the departure check in grab our checked in bags off the carousel and attempt to be rebooked onto another flight. Thankfully we were changed to a flight (operated by Qantas) to Perth via Adelaide with an extra waiting time of 2 hours in Melbourne airport. Again things turned out well for us given you get IFE on Qantas flights and food/drinks are included however this experience really does remind us that paying the extra cash for an airline Virgin Australia or Qantas is much more reliable. I'm all for flying cheap airlines but this experience was a joke how can one airline have so many problems in four days? Not once did we receive a sincere apology from Jetstar flight.",1
"Kansai to Singapore on 2nd July. If you like a great dose of uncertainty before you fly, then Scoot is the perfect airline for you! For a 19.35 flight, we found out our flight is delayed 1hr 40 mins!  Before the gates open, we get another surprise delay again!",1
"Singapore to Guangzhou, flying with Scoot. They have good aircraft, staff, etc, but their schedule is just crazy. They cannot operate the Guangzhou flight on time even though they have a blocked flight time which is much longer than the actual flying time. Have to improve their game. Pros, a good aircraft in the Boeing 787, nice staff and good seats. The cons: bad scheduling - remote gate in Guangzhou is horrendous (other airlines get better gates). Horrible placing of light and call attendant button in the seat area, and it went off every 10 seconds in the flight.",0
"Chiang mai to Kuala Lumpur. Although flights are well managed when on the plane, the check in process is the worst of any airlines I've ever seen. Wait 1 hour to move a few meters, and eventually 30 minutes before each flight they fast forward people through check in since many people are late. Literally they checked in 20 people in 45 minutes, about 10 minutes for each group and I feel this is generous, this makes no sense at all. Also, check in machines were pretty useless since everyone had to check in anyway, which is weird. Perhaps it's the AirAsia Chiang Mai that's so slow .. they need to get their stuff together, horrible experience.",1
"Air Asia Japan: I got an excellent deal around 10000 yen return to Sappor half the price of ANA and JAL. One way ticket with absolutely no frills. Aircraft smelling new cabin crew quite nice seat pitch very tight but bearable for a short flight something to expect for a LCC. I was extremely surprised by their ""boarding"" gate and waiting area: it was some space taken from a warehouse and a tent from where passengers are bussed to the airplane. Although I know it's a LCC it it's not what I expected for a major international airport! Arrival and Departure at Sapporo was at a ""deluxe"" gate with a boarding bridge and normal waiting room next to ANA gates.Otherwise it was OK and good price/quality. But do not expect anything luxurious from them!",0
"I flew Scoot from Singapore to Seoul Incheon and I asked for water. They gave me a small cup of water and wanted to charge me $3 SGD for that because it was hot water and so I thought $3 is a bit overpriced for a cup of water not even bottled water. They wanted to charge me $9 for the USB charging port underneath my seat. I took another budget airline back T'Way and they offered free charging usb on their seats. Budget airline this kind of service ok but very money minded for everything. Everything add up don't really become so ""budget airline"" coming from being the sister of Singapore Airlines very disappointing. Seats were not spacious, leg room is ok, I couldn't put my arm on the arm rest because my neighbour and my seats were very close",1
Frustrating trip to Launceston flying Jetstar. Remember to book any checked in luggage more than 24 hours before your flight and if you get an error message that says you are not eligible to book call their service centre to resolve (which we should have done) as baggage charges increase significantly if you buy baggage allowance at the airport. We also arrived to the airport with ample time to spare but waited 30 mins in a service queue to sort baggage which caused us then to be late for flight. Partly expected for a low cost airline I suppose.,1
"My flight with AirAsia was from Singapore to Penang. Boarding was slow but we reached Penang before the scheduled arrival time. Cabin crew were friendly and were eager in helping passengers but they could have shown more warmth by smiling more. Seat was okay. Overall, the flight with AirAsia was a good one.",0
We arrived 1.5 hours before our flight. Most of the kiosks were broken and we were sent to 4 different counters by the Air Asia staff.  After we finally made it to the front of the line to drop off our bags they refused to take our bags telling us we were too late. The lady at counter V16 was extremely rude and began criticizing me for not hearing her over the speaker system about the last call for dropping off our bags. I explained to her that we did not hear her because we were being shuffled around by their staff from counter to counter. She replied by telling me that she didnt believe that I didnt hear her and continued to criticize me further. She took zero accountability for their incompetent staff. We ended up missing our flight and had to rebook another flight. Later I returned to her counter to get her name so I could file a report but the staff acted dumb and told me they didnt know her name. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and was told it was his day off?! None of the staff members wear name tags. We will never travel AirAsia again!,1
"Jetstar Max Bundle is a complete rip off and simply awful! Much better to fly economy on a premium carrier like Thai Airways instead for around the same price. Jetstar is not a good airline at the best of times. I wouldn't fly Jetstar, but when I need extra baggage allowance (40 kg's as I sometimes have to travel with a lot of technical equipment for work) it has been a good option in the past. But Jetstar gets worse and worse as an airline year after year. I got the Max Bundle as I thought it would make the flight more comfortable and would reduce the cost of adding 40kg's anyhow. Neither was true. I did not get my upfront seat selection! The upfront area of the aircraft for max bundle is behind a whole section of economy class seats that weren't even available as an up front option with the max bundle. So the whole upfront seat selection is a lie. What else do you get with the Max bundle. One really small bad 'meal'. Apparently a voucher to use on another Jetstar flight if you cancel. I didn't need to, but I can imagine the process is at least as awful as the rest of the booking process. What you don't get with the Max Bundle: A blanket or anything to make the flight more comfortable. Inflight entertainment. All that costs a lot more. You also don't get the seat you book. It also took 45 minutes for the luggage to arrive at the carousel from this Jetstar flight. Conclusion: Don't buy the max bundle on Jetstar, fly economy on a premium carrier like Thai for approximately the same price.",1
"Colombo to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. This is the fifth time that I flew with Air Asia. I've used a few other budget airlines and the services, seats, etc. are standard for any budget airlines - so no complaints. However, I made a purchase for food/drinks on Air Asia, the cabin crew would say that they did not have a small change & promised to give me the change later. On my recent trip from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur, they owed me RM4 and didn't give me the change (I forgot to ask them before I left).",1
"Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Very good experience, bought the premium flex package and still cheaper than other airline e.g. Cathay Dragon. Also you can enjoy a better flight experience than the traditional airline. The lounge is good too. It is a good place for you the relax.",0
"Darwin to Brisbane . Last night i was seated between two men and there was used mask at the front of me. After everyone seated I moved to front seat with nobody at all, 3 seats for health relate esp this Covid19 time. A staff came quick said ""did you hear PA!"" I said no sorry. She told ""move back to your seat!"" Didn't you have little bit of manner to speak with a customer or ask why do I have to move. After i moved back,  more than 15 mins before all staffs gave safety instruction so I dont know why she pick me to cranky about? All others staffs been very kindafterward though.",1
"Our experience with the company is simply terrible. I booked a flight to Surigao and not to Siargao (islands with very similar names). Yes, the mistake is mine. The company did not try to help us understand that the islands are so close that the hour and a half ferry separates them, they treat us with terrible indifference. We paid a lot of money for the tickets because of our luggage. Their attitude just humiliated us. We tried to reach a compromise with them and book a ticket later in the day but everything was sold out. We asked for a discount for tomorrow's flight but their answer remained ""we can't"" without showing any effort on their part.",1
Flew Melbourne to Christchurch and was a horrific experience. Leg room sufficient for people no taller than 5 1/2 foot. Fight was delayed and to top it off I landed in Christchurch 3 days ago yet my luggage still hasn't arrived. Any attempt to deal with their customer services was painful. Don't fly Jetstar unless you want sore legs and a nightmare experience.,1
Flew on JQ527 from Sydney to Melbourne on 17/9. As a normal Qantas traveller and having not travelled on Jetstar for 8 years I was pleasantly surprised of how good the service was. The flight itself was full and boarded late. Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas. My only problem was that there was no inflight entertainment whatsoever although I suppose that's the case with most budget airlines.,0
"I booked with Cebu Pacific just before coronavirus. Unfortunately they cancelled my flight and refused to give me a refund. Instead they gave me a Travel Fund credit that I had to use within 1 year. The world was still locked down when the expired date of my travel fund credit was due to end, therefore making it impossible to use the credit. Cebu Pacific have refused to extend the credit and refused to refund my money for the flight they cancelled. As they are refusing to provide the product I purchased and refusing to return my money, they have basically stolen money from me.",1
We were a group of five who took CGK - DMK - CGK flight (QZ 252 and QZ 255) both stints were pretty much on time efficient check in process at both airports. As expected we were seated at distant rows which was alright for us. Overall very satisfactory.,0
I booked my tickets through Indigo to travel to my hometown in Kolkata during Diwali. I am impressed with the services provided by Indigo. A320's were clean and spotless with great sitting arrangements and ample leg space.,0
"Perth to Phuket via Singapore. We were traveling as a family of 3. Wife, kid and myself. The kid was a minor so she didn't have a seat allocated. But Wife and my seats were allocated on different rows. Asked the crew onboard and they were helpful, though the flight was full she asked the couple seating on a windows seat which has 3 seats if they could go in business class which they agreed to and then she relocated us to the 3 seats. That was excellent for the staff to look after us, and also she kept checking with us if all was fine. Excellent Customer Service.",0
"The seats are abysmal for a long-haul flight, both my wife and I had intense lower back pain around 8 hours in. No entertainment available onboard, they will advertise free Wifi, but it only worked about 20% of the time. As a low-cost airline, no meals, snacks or drinks are included, you have to pay in advance or onboard. You cant even get a cup of water for free. Check-in procedure was horrific. No online checkin, the self-check kiosks did not work at Narita, luckily we arrived three hours early because it took nearly two to get through the line. If you have to fly this airline, be sure to get travel insurance. If you have the extra $100-200 to spare, fly with someone else, its worth it.",1
"At Mumbai airport, during check in, the staff took care to verify the negative RT PCR reports of all the passengers travelling to Karnataka which was appreciated even though the seat selection during online check in was not free unlike the previous time when I flew which was a surprise. Boarding started well ahead of schedule and it seems that Indigo is deploying with high capacity Airbus A321 Neo aircraft on high density routes to get as much passengers and load as possible. The crew was welcoming and wished everyone during boarding and deboarding which was much appreciated as these small things do matter. The luggage could have perhaps come a bit earlier than expected but apart from that there is nothing much that one can fault IndiGo on because everything was perfect: the fare, the on time arrival, the crews attitude. It has rightly achieved it's status as one of the top LCCs in Asia.",0
First time I have flown Scoot. I have never experienced such nonsense all at once from one airline. first they changed my flight and then refused to let me change it to a suitable date. Then they changed my meal from a hot meal to sandwiches which I already paid for as an option. Then they lost my baggage even though I paid extra so that they would specifically look after my baggage. Also the seats are a nightmare with no headrest and are very cramped. I had to pay extra to change back the date so this was no cheap trip.,1
Jetstar Airways isn't a budget carrier in terms of the price they charge. It cost my group members over $800 each to fly from Singapore to Hangzhou when tickets on full-fledge flights with meals refreshments and entertainment on other airlines like SIA and Cathay Pacific can cost less. It's 'budget' quality in seats with very narrow leg space so the flight attendants insisted that all hand carry had to be stored in the overhead compartments. Problem is that all the compartments near our seats were full with the crew's and other passengers luggage. There didn't seem to be restrictions on the size and the number of hand-carry passengers could bring on the plane. A crew member offered to squeeze my backpack into a compartment that was far from my seat. As I had my passport and money in it it refused to have it out of my sight. I had a most uncomfortable trip with the bag in front of me and hardly any room to stretch my legs. Will never take Jetstar again - not when I can get better service at a lower cost on a regular flight.,1
"Sydney to Gold Coast. I got to admit, Jetstar has raised the bar. This is my second flight with them this year and everything went smoothly. I checked in online and getting through security was a breeze. Boarding was controlled with, great to see a LCC getting this done correctly. Once onboard I found the Cabin Crew a unenthusiastic as it was very routine with the attitude of get it done and over with. The Captain made one announcement and did not even mention flight times. Again, passengers seated in emergency exits were not iritirated with safety procedures. Overall, the flight was great but they need to refine their Customer Engagement.",0
We travelled from Sydney to KL to Bandung and a few days later from Bandung to Denpasar. We were very satisfied with all aspects of the trip. We had paid for a meal on the Sydney to KL leg of our journey and the food was of good quality and enjoyable.,0
"Bali to Surabaya. First delay from 8PM to 10PM via SMS. Then, another delay from 10PM to 12AM. Ground crews only counted as 2 hours delayed since they claimed initial information has been given by SMS. When claiming for compensation, the crews were not professional at all; not telling any apology, joking at each others while serving customers and asked me to come back and forth to the counter since I had to bring 6 boxes of meal alone. It was the second chance I gave to this airline. No more Lion Air.",1
"Cochin to Delhi with IndiGo, flight was late by 1 hour due to incoming aircraft arriving late.  Seat was 13E(XL). Seats not that comfortable and cushioning is very hard. Had the instant noodles which was tasty along with Cappuccino which is always hot and tasty. Service was okay. At DEL, baggage took a long time to come.",1
"I bought tickets for Kuala Lumpur to Penang return. At Penang airport I reached check in 30 minutes before flight time. However, they refused to let me board and simply said I had to purchase tickets with their next flight as gates are closed. The money I had paid for the flight was wasted and I was forced to purchase another one way ticket to KL from the airport with Malindo Air. I could understand if it was an international flight, but the fact that they refused to allow me to board with 30 minutes remaining is unacceptable.",1
"We were attracted by the lower cost but we will never fly with Scoot again. We had premium economy seats that were comparable to economy seats in economy. The boarding was quite efficient; but comfort, service and my food were of very poor quality. The cabin was not clean, we used tissue paper to clean table and armrests. A drink of water was offered in the first hour before a plastic covered menu was passed around, only two meals were available. No free water, no free snack was offered during the flight, an announcement informed passengers that they had received their free meals and would have to pay for any more food or drinks. Blankets were distributed upon request. Large, yellow, thin polyester squares that were not providing me any warmth.",1
"Tokyo to Singapore. We check with hand baggage and normal bag. They made us pay 7200 for check in because it was more than 10KG per person, so we needed to pay this money yes or yes at the counter or otherwise we could not fly. After all this, we go up to the plane. So small seats and uncomfortable, the plane was making the sounds of the Steward Call every time without reason and lights were going on and off constantly during all the flight, basically we couldn't sleep even 1 minute because of this annoying things. We could not even connect to the wifi so we tried to eat something as a last choice for pass the time, but the food was so bad and at the same time the most expensive food I've bought in a plane. I asked for asahi beer and it wasn't even cold! Definitely not going to repeat this airline ever again. Scoot for me the worst airplanes and service ever.",1
"Penang to Krabi. This is a bad experience when buying the ticket for travel in September. The price is 103 at the beginning, but I key in the wrong phone number, so I try to back and correct again. But! The flight ticket jump to 109. Ok is fine. Then I fill up all the details. But when I press the payment, the system change the price to 112. Okay, I feel like not worth to buy it, I try to search again, the price become 119! I feel like this not fair to the customers. When knowing the customers buying the tickets, the system can change the price! This airline totally is vampire. I really feel bad while buying the flight tickets.",1
In January we travelled on four flights in Cambodia-Thailand-Vietnam. Everything about the flights was completely satisfactory and simply no fault could be found. I have no hesitation in recommending them. It's a pity such airlines based in the UK / Europe do not seem to operate at this level. Food and inflight entertainment not used. Only included as one star as the system demands it must be answered.,0
"Flew Kunming to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. We were lucky to fly on a new plane with new seats. The seats are thinner but supportive and as a result, legroom increased considerably. We are happy with the new seats. The service on board is the usual AirAsia standard, no complaints for a frequent flyer. The only setback was a group of passengers loudly throughout the whole flight, and stewards/stewardess unable to get them to stop.",0
AK384 KUL-CGK / BDO-KUL. Both flight departed on time and arrived a few minutes earlier than scheduled. Cabin crew for KUL-CGK - seemed friendlier and approachable. Luggage drop were fast as I did web check in.,0
On 9th August I flew from Wellington to Christchurch on Jetstar. It is only a 38 minute flight but it enables one to travel between the two main islands of New Zealand. I checked in online without any trouble. I was offered a snack and water in advance for about 6 dollars but declined as it was such a short flight. I had coffee in the terminal before as I arrived early. Overall a very comfortable flight. Sky bridges were used in both directions as I was seated in in the front of the aircraft in seat 10C.,0
Colombo to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. It was a nice flight with no problems. Boarding was orderly. Seats were comfortable and I got some rest. A nice budget airline. Will fly them in the future.,0
"Melbourne to Sydney. What can I say, as usual departed late, waited for collecting my bags till 6:30. The plane was supposed to leave at 4:15. Very disappointed. Needed to be at my daughter's school for Xmas carols and didn't make it. One will hope Jetstar will keep it up during the holidays but no. Hit and miss, business as usual.",1
Air Asia cancelled my flights 3 times and refused to refund me after 6 months and offer me credits. By refusing to refund customers for cancelled flights is as good as cheating customers of their money.,1
"Pekanbaru to Penang via Kuala Namu. Painfully long delay during transit in Kuala Namu, Medan. There were complaints about it in the past reviews, and the delay seems to have been very consistent if not worse. The airline seemingly waited until the seats were full to board. Loading/unloading of cargo baggage was seen to operate manually without conveyor, causing damages to the baggage. Those who travel with tight schedule and family are advised not to choose this airline. Besides safety, my hope for Lion Air is to be punctual in the future especially when catering domestic flight. Please make sure also that client's baggage was handled with greater care. Thank you.",1
My flight was cancelled and rescheduled several times and was 36 hours after my original arrival time. This resulted in an extra hotel night and new flights at the last minute. I filed a claim from Nov 2022 and still have not received my refund. You get a bot that just runs in circle. I am not a rare case and many are in my situation. I will not stay quite on this matter.,1
Dubai to Manila. To not allow people with a one-way ticket on the aircraft is an absolute scam! I was not allowed on the plane until I showed I had a ticket to leave Manila. It is obvious that this is a scam to try to get people to buy another Cebu ticket. There is no immigration law or policy that states that I need to have a ticket to leave the country before I am permitted to board a plane or enter the country. Shame on you.,1
"Terrible service. Consistent delays with vague excuses. And they will try to gouge you on the hand carry weight limit, so make sure hand carry is under 7kg to be safe. Filthy cabins and seats.",1
"I have flown Jetstar for years with a few minor incidents but never again. Paying the few extra dollars for another airline is worth it, Jetstar are by far the worst airline Ive flown in the world. Went to Thailand for ten days, flight home was cancelled and Jetstar cant rebook another flight for twelve days later! I found Jetstar flights that would get me home however they wouldnt book them as they included a different connection home. So now Ive had to pay $1700 for a one way flight to Melbourne and they wont provide a refund, only a voucher. I can accept a few days, but almost two weeks is appalling. Not worth flying with them, it always ends up costing more but this is ridiculous.",1
"On March 16 Saturday, morning landed from USA, I took the morning Indigo Flight to Tirupati. I was running late to catchup my evening return flight to Hyderabad, based my request, Indigo and Tirupati Airport Security helped me, reopened gate and security to get into flight which starts at 9pm which is impossible but they did it. I should thank Indigo Airlines Customer priceless service.",0
Melbourne to Sydney. Overall an enjoyable flight. Check in was no problem and the plane left on time I enjoyed the ham and cheese toastie that I prepaid. The staff were very helpful and friendly as well. There was no IFE which was no problem for such a short flight.,0
Flying LionAir (operated by Wings Abadi Air) from Bali to Komodo Airport on 7th Oct. What an absolute nightmare! It started 3 days before trying to re-confirm my flight with them as it has been booked 9 months earlier from the UK and I had an email advising slight schedule change the day earlier. We arrive at Bali airport to be met with chaos at check in most disorganised airline ever (and I have travelled many times in the Far East and Africa). It took about an hour to get to the front of the queue when we did the girl checking us in seemed to be having a few problems with the booking but eventually checked us in and took our baggage and issued our boarding passes. We arrive at the gate at the required time to be met again by chaos it appeared all Lion Air and Wings Air flights go from this gate I confirmed with desk clerk we were at the right gate and we sat down and waited the boarding time arrived and past I went back to the desk as we approached the departure time to again be told right gate please wait! The departure time now had passed and it was about an hour past departure time a few flights had been boarded but no news of ours none of the departure boards were working so again I went up for a third time to find out what was happening asked another person to be advised 'Flight Cancelled' and you have to go back to check in. I got the clerk to assist us back to the airline desk and we found out the flight had actually been cancelled the night before they never should have checked us in and took our luggage. The airline were not able to rebook us either on to another flight so we lost our trip to Komodo. The worst of it is we were not the only ones this had happened to it appears other people had been checked in onto flights that had also been cancelled to other destinations. I would not recommend.,1
"Bangkok to Siem Reap. After almost 10 yrs of flying around Asia with several different airlines I must say that AirAsia tops them all. Never  had a problem flying with them, Ground Staff was friendly, service minded and with a smile. Even when I made a mistake with a ticket hey sorted the problem with no hassle.",0
"Sydney to Melbourne. If you have travel deadlines, don't fly with Jetstar: To start off with : our flights were cancelled. The service desk guy was shouting at others that he could not accommodate people to other flights and that Thursday flying people had to now wait till Saturday for next flight. And our flight back to Sydney was cancelled as well. Never flying Jetstar again.",1
"I would like to share our recent experience with JetStar airlines and advise you to reconsider traveling with them, especially if you are traveling with young children. Our flight was delayed in Phuket for 40 hours with 6 time changes, which caused a lot of inconvenience and frustration. We were removed from the plane at 11:30 pm and were taken to a hotel provided by JetStar. We had a 5-month-old baby with us, but unfortunately when we arrived around 1:30am, the hotel did not have any safe sleeping conditions for our child, including a cot. Despite repeated requests, we were denied any proper sleeping arrangements for our child, which made our situation even more difficult. We were unable to book another hotel as we were told that our flight would be delayed for only 8 hours, which kept getting pushed due to issues that were entirely in JetStar's control. Moreover, we found that the information provided on the JetStar website or at the airport was entirely contradictory to the information we received when we spoke to someone online. This caused even more confusion and frustration during our long and tiring ordeal. We strongly advise parents against traveling with JetStar, especially if you are traveling with young children. Our experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and we would not want any other family to go through the same ordeal.",1
"Guwahati to Hyderabad. I was charged a Rs 400 for an extra baggage of mere 1.5 kg. I paid the money. They charge on each and every service provided, however the customer care is pathetic. My flight is 2 hrs delayed and we are not compensated for that. If you can charge us on anything you like then we should be compensated as refund as well.  Baggage surcharges must be cut down.",1
Recently travelled SIN-TPE-SIN. Managed to get the promotional fares on their recently launched new route. Poor legroom and seat space but bearable for a 4hr flight. The Air-conditioning was too cold both ways. Cabin crew was amateurish but efficient. Flight to TPE was full but only 60% on the way back. Overall good value.,0
"I know that it's a budget airline, but it was quite frustrating. Going to Kalibo, the flight was delayed by almost 3 hrs and we were compensated with a banana chocolate loaf and water. Going back to Manila was worse. They moved my flight to 4 hours earlier and if that wasn't annoying enough they actually delayed it on the day. I left Kalibo at 3.20, close to my original flight time but instead of doing my planned activities I had to wait in a crowded airport frustrated. This time no compensation.",1
"Lion Air is the worst airline in Indonesia. I've had this flight from Jambi to Jakarta (JT 607) delayed over 3 hours in which cancelled all my activities. The flight is scheduled for 6 a.m however until 9 a.m there is no reasonable explanation when the flight will be departed. The only reason is the flight is postponed due to the bad weather. However, at the same time, several airlines has departed with the same weather condition. My advice for this airline - avoid it, the ticket was cheap but it is not worth it.",1
"Cebu Pacific never fails to disappoint me. Tuguegarao to Manila is only served by Cebu and PAL. PAL was fully booked so I did not have a choice. The aircraft arrived late, probably 30 minutes before boarding. Although this was a domestic flight, 30 mins was definitely not enough turn around time. A very superficial apology that the flight was going to be delayed was offered. Delays seem to be a norm - I flew from HKG to MNL 3 days before this flight and it was delayed for nearly 3 hours. Time is very important to everyone. The fares are not cheap either - charging full service fares for an ultra-low cost service.",1
DPS-JOG return. Outbound we had one of the new 737-900ERs with mood lighting on return an older model. Both ways I was given an exit row seat which was much appreciated - standard seating is 28 inch pitch. Both flights were absolutely on time. Was tempted by Air Asia's new and slightly cheaper service but Lion Air's schedule (leave early morning return late evening) suited better. No complaints.,0
"I booked a flight through Scoot, it was a 17hr journey from Tokyo to Bangkok then to Singapore then finally to Chennai. The flight itself was comfortable but all the excess fees that have to be paid are ridiculous. Water cost $4, food was also extra and I was flying for almost an entire day. If I wished for my bags to be flown straight to my final destination that was also extra by purchasing their ""scoot-thru"" service. There was no inflight entertainment at all. Although this airline had a good flight they nickel and dime you for everything. If you are not traveling to Singapore, near by or if your total flight time is longer than 7 hours, I would not recommend this airline.",1
4 March 2015 Flight 6E178. 6 March 2015 Flight 6E665. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi back and forth and it was great. The seats were comfortable (I took the first row seat with more leg space) the crew were very pleasant and we arrived on time. On the way back I arrived 3 hours earlier in Delhi and they were kind enough to let me go on the next flight so I didn't have to wait at the airport. Overall my experience with Indigo was 5 stars!,0
Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru. I bought the ticket online for 75MYR including checked baggage of 20 kg when I reached the airport they charged me 90.10MYR for 15kg baggage which is the only baggage I have because I didn't check in 4 hours before the flight. The flight got delayed 1 hour. They destroyed my bag.,1
"Jetstar being a budget airline should not raise too high expectations and also I have very low expectations on any budget airline. However, there are budget airlines providing at least a minimum of convenience and there is Jetstar which doesnt even provide you online check-in on international flights since so many years. Even AirAsia is capable of providing that. Instead Jetstar makes you lining up at the airport for an hour just to complete your check-in  and this is the year 2023. Despite that, no customer service at all.",1
"Had a flight from Dunedin to Auckland. Scheduled to leave at 1900 left at 2050. Seems they were short of a steward. Classy (not) scanning of boarding passes. I have never heard ""OK [giggle] you can all go now."" Then waiting for a shuttle at AKL with a passenger from Wgtn (also on a flight with a long delay). Seems she was told the same story of being short of a steward. Two domestic flights delayed for hours with the same excuse. What is going on?",1
On the 5th June I travelled on Air Asia from Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. The plane was an Airbus 320 and very comfortable. I was able to get a lot of rest during the 3.5 hour flight. I had three seats to myself.,0
Bangkok to Coimbatore via Chennai. Flight was delayed 4 times then cancelled. They had 1 member of staff trying to rebook around 250 passengers. Not even water was provided while flights were rebooked (which took 7 hours). Only 150ml of water was given onboard the aircraft which we were on for 4 hours before being deplaned when they cancelled the flight. Luggage was then not sent to the destinations. It took 5 days to get my luggage back and they wouldnt even deliver it. I had to return to the airport.,1
"Worst airline in Asia, in terms of punctuality and service. I have encountered flight cancelled without refund (as nobody answers your queries its just a stupid bot), flight delayed without announcement, they irresponsibly made passengers wait and wait for hour at the boarding gate knowing connecting flight or arrival pick up would be affected. As a passenger, it's very poor management overall which made me concerned about the safety too. They also has a very lousy baggage weighing system that slows everyone down by making passengers repack their duty free into another bag but not necessarily cutting any weight. Price wise is good. But no value as they frequently cancel or delay flight without any refund. They should change their tag line from #everyone can fly To #fly at your own risk.",1
Managed to obtain really good priced tickets from SYD to SIN and back. 10 seats across on 772 which is pretty tight. Flight out on time departure and early arrival. Flight back early departure and arrival. OK for daytime flight but on the way back overnight very uncomfortable and impossible to sleep despite paying more for extra legroom seats.,0
"Dubai to Manila. There are a few issues I'd like to mention: 1. I arrived in Dubai at 00.20 on 15 July. My connecting flight, which was supposed to depart at 04.55, was delayed until 10.10 am (without explanation). The airline bought one free McDonald's meal for every customer, but in my opinion, that did not make up for a 5 hour delay. 2. When I made my booking, it was made clear that there would be no food available on the flight. However, once on the flight, I noticed that other passengers had been able to pre-book meals. It would have been nice if this option were available to me to - would have saved me from having to buy food at ridiculous prices in Dubai airport. 3. I understand that this is a budget airline, but the low cost is not worth the discomfort. The seats are tiny and do not recline. There is no inflight entertainment. This flight was almost 10 hours long and it was incredibly uncomfortable. The restrooms were dirty and smelled bad. 4. When we landed in Manila, the captain announced that because of the red thunder, there would be a slight delay in de-boarding. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the terminal we were supposed to use for de-boarding was occupied by another airline because of the disruption of the thunderstorm. He said we would wait for 10-15 minutes. This went on for two hours, with him periodically announcing that it would only be another 10-15 minutes. After the 6 hour delay and almost 10 hour flight, this pushed me past my breaking point. The pilot said it was beyond their control. I don't know if I believe that, but even if that were true, the airline/pilot could surely have come up with something better than repeating the same lie for two hours. I will never fly with this airline again, and would not recommend anyone else to do so.",1
"Hong Kong to Manila. Honestly the worst airline in the world. After flying with them the past few years my very long patience has finally grown thin. Been waiting hours for our flight, even just to check in because of their unorganisation and unprofessionalism. You'll get a refund of your flight after a year, no one can give you any information, no one even communicates with you. They dont communicate to their own staff about flight problems!",1
"Poorest ever land staff service at Singapore Changi airport terminal 4. I was facing difficulty to cross the custom by using Air Asia the boarding pass and the officer asked me to get land staff counter to verify my information and reprint my boarding pass. I asked the staff to reprint for me and and staff showed her unfriendly face and told me my flight got retimed from 2210 to 2230 without reprint my boarding pass. She asked me to quickly return to cross the immigration. I asked her to reprint and she questions with high tone and said: Do you want me to cancel your flight? I was like so shocked with such rude response from her at that time. This sounds like threatening me. Without further delays, immediately I go back to immigration and still cannot cross through due to boarding pass scan error. I asked the officer to manual assist me to crossing. Finally just in time for boarding.",1
Bombay-Jaipur return Pune-Nagpur. Easy check in and nice friendly staff in Bombay. On the return (Jaipur to Bombay) we were asked to carry no hand baggage onboard as it was a high security day. The airline could have informed us earlier as had breakable stuff in my hand baggage and they forced me to check it in. Pune to Nagpur efficient and competent crew.,0
Flew JQ946 Melb-Cairns on a weekday service. The check-in at Tullamarine is a bit chaotic and could be made a lot simpler with a couple of decent signs. The flight was on time and the crew cheerful and efficient. The range of movies on the in flight paid-for iPad was very limited and not really worth the money. The luggage arrived quickly after arrival in Cairns. Overall value for money.,0
Me and my husband we have one booking number and when we where checking in we got two different seats and when we asked the desk crew they said to us we have to pay money and that is not fair.  We will not travel with this AirAsia anymore,1
"Coimbatore to Singapore. Friendly Check-in staffs (the only positive) in Singapore and in Coimbatore.  Most unfriendly crew i have met. Our group had traveled with 2 children one 1 year and 10 months and the other 2 years and 25 days old. Since my daughter was over 2 years she was given a separate seat and charged fully (acceptable as she has exceeded the age of the infant) Then during the take off they wanted her to sit separately in her seat and wear a seat belt. The kid had slept sitting on her moms lap as the flight's take off time was only by 12 20 am. The air hostess took her forcefully and put her on the other seat and it was a rough time after that. Then the hostess said sorry and accepted to let her sit with the mother. The same thing happened on our way back from Singapore. The steward tried to put my daughter in the separate seat and she wouldn't sit. there was an announcement from the pilot that the flight will be taken back to the gate if the child doesn't sit in the seat. Luckily she slept for a while and we could lean her onto her seat and managed to put the seat belt over her. During landing the crew (4 of them) came stood around us and made sure they woke my daughter up, made her cry and they tried to forcefully make her sit on her seat. I lost it and asked all of them to move away and i was going to complain against all of them when we landed and did so. Other airlines even though they give a separate seat considering the age (2 years) they accept the baby to sit with the parent and give a extended seat belt. But no empathy here. They introduced Scoot as a budget airline. But it is no way cheaper compared to SilkAir. Travel with Silkair was so pleasant.  But Fly scoot such a joke. S$3 for water, S$15 for blanket etc etc. Even the cost is not an issue but the way they treated us was terrible. Sorry this will be my last ever travel with Fly scoot. Wouldn't recommend it to any one.",1
Perth to Denpasar (Bali) on A320. Everything about it was as you expect. Chosen for the exceptional price at the best times of day. Flights left on time/arrived early. Brand new aircraft. Only thing off-putting were the 'threats' about drinking alcohol on the flights and having future bookings cancelled as a consequence but I guess on a route like this they regularly get trouble.,0
BKK-CAN and HKG-BKK. My first experience of Thailand's division of Air Asia. Good value for money and only a few observations. Having paid for a 'hot seat' the priority boarding in BKK was only to the bus not the plane. There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off. Flights on-time and one of the aircraft was virtually brand new. If the price is right this is the way to go but they are not always the cheapest option especially to Hong Kong where competition is fierce with a multitude of third country carriers flying that route.,0
Excellent cabin crew both flights to Thailand. Very quiet and comfortable trip. Highly recommend and would not hesitate to travel Jetstar again in the future.,0
"They rebooked me to a flight next day and never sent me any notification. I arrive at the airport to find out that Im flying the next day and that the leg from Singapore to Berlin doesnt even exist on that day. The staff at Melbourne Airport is useless, they wont help you. When you call their support no one picks up. I was waiting for 50 min then the call dropped, second attempt another 30 min and no luck.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Manila. Pre flight customer service was a nightmare. My flight was delayed before my trip I was sent an SMS to be advised of this. I was offered an earlier flight that wasn't going to work because I was travelling from Adelaide at that time. There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad. When it comes to Staff service I have based it on the pre customer service as that's where I experienced most of the customer service.,1
"Arrived at Gate and staff did not allow me to board simply because my passport's middle name has a dash while my Vietnam evisa does not. Told them it was very normal that you don't/can't use dash in online forms. Gate staff told me they've seen these cases many times and passengers always get denied entry, contrary to my personal experiences. So we missed the flight. It was only after boarding closed did they send me to Service Counter. Service Counter staff was superb. She simply asked Hanoi station if the evisa is valid and got a YES within 10 minutes but that good news was too late for me. Hotel rooms are non-refundable. I asked why couldn't the gate staff ask Hanoi station and the shocking answer was because ""they did not have the right WhatsApp group chat"". Next staff tried to get me a refund but it was rejected. The closest category was ""incomplete documentation"" - implying it's my fault. This is clearly the airline's fault. The Gate Staff misinterpreted visa rules and did not bother to ask proper authorities.",1
"Singapore to Osaka. Overall, I think that Scoot is a great airline and offers value for money.  My seat was very comfortable despite being very slim in design. I was worried that I was going to have a sore lower back after sitting for 6 hours on the plane and purchased a cushion at Changi Airport before my flight. However I found that I did not need it. The food was good. I paid a little extra and got a premium meal. I had Nasi Goreng with Chicken Satay. It came with a potato salad and Haagen Dazs ice cream. The meal I received was better than some of the meals I have had on full-service airlines in recent years. It was well worth the extra money. I did not have a premium meal on the way home. However, what I chose was tasty. I watched movies on my I-Pad on the way to Osaka but on the way home I paid for the inflight entertainment. I thought that there were a good selection of movies and tv shows. It is well worth paying for on a longer flight like mine. The selection was better than some other airlines. I had no issues on the ground staff or flight attendants. In fact I found the staff to be very friendly. My flight home was delayed by about 30 minutes but this did not concern me. Overall, I have booked two more flights with Scoot since this experience.",0
I have always found Air Asia over the years to be very clinical. Always on time and you get what you pay for really. Its a low cost carrier with no frills. I have never had any concerns to fly with them. That will continue to remain the same.,0
"The one hour delay of the flight was only communicated when I arrived at the airport, so I got stuck there. No apology or explanation in regards to the delay given, neither by gate staff, nor by the pilot. Its the 2nd time this happened to me within a month, so it seems this has become the norm now. Otherwise uneventful flight.",0
"Visakhapatnam to Sydney via Singapore. No proper and prior information regarding if we need Negative PCR test report. It's all decided while the boarding passes are given. If no PCR report, you need to reschedule and look for accommodation and bear the charges.",1
I flew from Phuket to Perth and need not have worried. Flights were on time the aircraft excellent great cabin staff and the food I ordered was quite acceptable for the price. The seating was fine and no different to a full fare airline. Would rate it as one of the most comfortable flights I have taken.,0
"Male to Taipei via Kuala Lumpur. I booked a extra meal and a value pack at the same time, so I would get 2 meals for each segment of flight. However, I only got one meal served. I left a feedback to their customer service several times,but I still can't get any proper response so far. They told me they will handle it on 04 July but it's 13 August now I still get nothing. Even their two agents also told me they had refund the some fee, however it became lies. I really doubt they will really refund this fee. What a terrible customer service?",1
"Air Asia are an awful company with zero customer service. If only Id looked at the reviews before booking. They make promises to refund cancelled flights but these refunds never arrive. Its impossible to speak to anyone and the automated chat is worse than useless and just takes you round in circles. I finally got a response on twitter and a promise of a refund. This was then turned into a credit account and now nobody will respond. A credit account is useless as I wouldnt go anywhere near Air Asia in the future. Theyve actually profited from covid as theyve neither provided a flight or refund, which is disgraceful behaviour.",1
"This was flight AK329 from Semarang to Kuala Lumpur, a morning flight which departed 10 mins behind schedule. The captain made a flight-related announcement after attaining cruising altitude. It was generally a good flight in fine weather. The plane arrived in KUL as scheduled and landing was okay.",0
JQ926 BNE-CNS. The flight had no entertainment which I knew so I just brought my own food on the plane for my entertainment and to eat. The flight with your own entertainment is great.,0
"Delhi to Visakhapatnam. Good service and price. But why not charge 200-300 extra on any flight and serve a free meal. Snacks are ok but a meal will do better . Also , moving to terminal 2 at Delhi Airport was not a good idea. No Windows to watch outside for those who love plane-spotting. Also, there are no good passenger facilities available in terminal 2.",0
"I would like to thank Indigo staffs for their dedication and willingness to help in critical situations. Especially ground staff Aishwarya at Kannur airport who has helped me to get my laptop from my brother to me even after my boarding, at the very last moment to start the journey. That was very tense moments for me as I felt no point in traveling to Hyderabad if I can't bring my laptop with me to finish some important jobs. Thank you very much all the staffs who helped me in that situation. I am proud to be a frequent flyer in Indigo.",0
"Very disappointing. Reached airport on time and also had web check in done but refused to let us fly. Indigo staff took too much time with the guy standing before me and by the time I reached the counter, refused to board me. I requested but the staff were rude and didn't co-operate at all. Ruined my vacation. Still one hour was for the flight to fly. Didn't refund me or arrange any alternative flight. Rude and non co-operative staff, poor service, sitting there to loot passengers.",1
Pangkal Pinang (Bangka) to Jakarta what should be a one-hour flight. Flight delayed by 4.5 hours and almost no information given. I eventually found out that the plane was still in Jakarta awaiting the pilot. After a one-hour delay we were given chicken and rice (horrid if you're a vegetarian but that's Indonesia for you!). After that nothing - not even a word about compensation. The staff were fine onboard - it's the management who need a serious shake- up if they think a 4.5 hour delay for a 1-hour flight is in any way acceptable.,0
Bangkok to Yangon Yangon to KUL and KUL to Bangalore. Flights left slightly late. Food available on board was reasonably priced and good quality. However I was intrigued that each time we weighed in our bags on the Air Asia scales they were 1kg to 1.5 kg heavier than on Qantas or Thai scales - and we had exactly the same contents in them. I also noticed that the crew paid scant attention to young children who did not have seat belts on.,0
"Sydney to Athens via Singapore. It's just a shame. The first flight was delayed 30 mins before boarding (""because they were cleaning the plane"") and then, once we all had boarded, around 50 more minutes without any explanation. On the second flight we landed more than one hour later. I think it's crazy that they don't provide you even a bottle of water. You are stuck there easily for 12 hours and you don't get anything. Even if it's a low cost company you are still paying! I tried to buy some food and they don't accept debit cards so I didn't drink or eat from Singapore to Athens. Of course they don't have screens for entertainment. The air conditioning was crazy freezing. Many people complained (an old guy had a huge argument with one member of the crew). Conclusion: pay a bit more and be treated as a human.",1
"Rude staff. Worst service I have booked 4 flights for July, all were cancelled. Now we have to fly via Manila. I travelled with my sister and we placed our hand carry together in one cabin size luggage that weights 10kgs and they did not allow that even though we dont even have extra personal bags (only 1 cabin luggage for the two of us that didnt even exceed 14kg as we are allowed to have 7kg each). They still asked us to separate it and carry 5kg each. How stupid.",1
My wife and I have just completed 6 flights with Cebu Pacific around the Philippines over the past month. Our plane was never delayed (more often leaving and arriving early) for shortish flights seats are comfortable enough. I would fly with them again.,0
"I was travelling from Bali to Hong Kong, where I had to transfer at KL. I only had a cabin size suitcase, and a drawstring backpack with me. I have been travelling with AirAsia many times in the past, due to the it's competitive price, even though the seats are uncomfortable, but I don't mind it for short hauls. I have always been using the same cabin size suitcase when travelling with them. So size wise, I know my suitcase is definitely fine. For my drawstring backpack, anyone who has one knows you can't really put much in it. I only had my personal documents in the bag, plus a jacket to use while on the flight. After I finished checking in, a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. The total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg (the total permitted weight is 7kg for AirAsia). This is exactly what I came with, perhaps less. I threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. They weighed my luggage on my outward flights, I can't remember the total weight for that, but they let me through, but gave me a little advice to make sure I was within limit the next time. However, on my return flight, this guy did not let me through, he took my boarding pass away, even when I told him I was running late, I only had less than 10min left before boarding time! He said I had to check in my suitcase. So I had to quickly rearrange things in my suitcase again! After all this messing around, my suitcase was finally ready for checking it, and I was charged IDR 800k for that! My flight was only IDR 1,380,400! I could have pay a little bit more, and flew with Cathay, which comes with 20kg check-in luggage, a much comfier journey with entertainment, plus direct flight. What really annoyed me was that after I went to the other side at the boarding gate, I saw so many people with over-sized luggage. I spoke to 2 staff there to make a complaint, but they ignored me. As soon as I landed, I sent an email to AirAsia to make this complaint, there were a lot of emails back and forth, but they were not willing to do anything about it. I'm fine if they want to follow their rules strictly, but please make sure it's consistent.",1
"Bangkok to Manila. A shambles of a check in at Bangkok, queuing for ages until after the last check in time! Told to run to the gate - this was not my fault but their very slow check in service. The plane was old but serviceable, with no IFE but some pay for snacks available - which I didn't buy. The plane landed at the new Manila terminal 1 which is very nice and we were out to the Yellow taxis in minutes. All in all not a bad service especially for the price.",0
"Melbourne to Tokyo via Gold Coast. Appalling experience that will be my last, given that I return from Japan this week. My flight was canceled at Melbourne airport on the day The flight was supposed to depart, just after I drove 5 hours from my hometown. I then spent around 6 hours with 4 different calls to Jetstar trying to sort it out, as they were refusing to talk to passengers at the airport. They rescheduled my flight the following day and said that I would have my extra legroom that I had booked in advance. Got on the flight the following day to Japan and was put in a regular seat and Im a person who is 187cm tall. Worst flight of my life. Felt awful after arriving in Japan. This all happened on the 10/12/2019 when there was a global outage which was said by the staff on the day some 3 hours after my flight was scheduled to leave. Thank you Jetstar. Will never consider you for another flight and will let everyone I know know that they shouldnt fly Jetstar either.",1
"I flew Jetstar quite a bit during my month in Australia and NZ in Feb and March. This is a budget airline so you get what you pay for. I encountered no problems, my seat was ok, I ate before my flights so did not have to resort to expensive tasteless airline food and the flight attendants were competent and helpful - with one exception. This was the Queenstown to Sydney JQ224 on 13 March which was staffed by strange beings that had definitely not been trained properly since they lacked the usual easy-going but professional attitude of other flight crews I encountered and their appearance and uniforms were not up to standard. I would quite happily fly Jetstar again and would just ask them to improve one thing - their onboard PA announcements. I do not know why the flight and cabin crew find it necessary to rush and gabble their announcements; their audience is belted into seats with very little else to do other than to sit still and listen to them. It would be very nice to hear all of what the pilot or attendant is telling us about the route and arrival times etc instead of having to listen to badly delivered gabble. It made me wonder how they would get their message across in a crisis.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Plane was clean, cool and half empty. I could stretch out on a whole line of empty seats. Polite crew. No meals served or sold on board as usual with Lion Air.",0
"On my first flight with them I had a delay of more than 14 hours. Also, now they lost my luggage when I arrived in Queenstown. It's been 5 days and they still don't know where my suitcase is or give me any information. It's the worst company I've ever traveled with.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. We didnt get our assigned seats as the plane was changed last minute. We were told to sit anywhere until they have everyone seated which meant we had to constantly get up to give up the seats. This was not a good experience. The staff did not apologise. One staff member got very rude to us and shouted at us to be patient. Our flight got delayed by 70 minutes. Will not be flying with them again that's for sure!,1
"Worst airline there is. No matter where you go with them in indonesia, rules are always different. One time 15 kg, the other 20 kg, which makes you pay every time. Obviously 15 kg for a check in luggage is not enough at all. Always late, cancelled or problems with the airplane. Ridiculous company really We did take it a few times in indonesia (booked in advance) and it was horrific Nearly missed a connection flight because they are late! We took 6 flights and no 1 was on time  My knees touch the seat in front of me, not a bit, it is pressed against it, the most uncomfortable airplane. No water or anything is provided on the flight, if it is 1 2 or 3 hours, you do not even get 1 sip of water. The air hostess do absolutely nothing the entire flight, they sit around on their phones. They work 10 minutes before take off and 10 minutes after landing.",1
"Makassar to Surabaya. Searching for the cheapest on this route, but finally get this airlines, but finally realize this is not cheap enough. A little bit delay, because high traffic before take off.",1
Hong Kong to Chiang Mai. Both out-bound and in-bound flights were on-time. Very little or no turbulence experienced during journeys. This was very good. Check-ins at ground were fast and efficient. Will choose Air Asia again in the future.,0
Launceston to Brisbane return. Check In Staff were friendly both ends and flights on time aircraft clean and tidy. Return A320 near new and spotless. Cabin Crew were friendly and walked up and down tending to passengers the entire flight. We had emergency exit seats on the trip over which made the flight very pleasant and row 4 on the return The seats on the newer aircraft were much firmer and anything over 2 hours becomes hard work but all in all these were cheap tickets and we got exactly what we paid for and this made the trip excellent value. The convenience of this direct flight is always worth the chance of flying with this budget Airline.,0
Denpasar to SYD 787 Dreamliner. Was sent an email offering paid upgrade to business class so couldn't refuse. Seats comfortable (although didn't fully recline) entertainment good service excellent. The 787 Dreamliner is so smooth you hardly feel it take off or land. Will not refuse to take an upgrade to business offer again.,0
I had cabin suitcase as I was travelling with Infant. They did not allowed me to take it to cabin. They charged 7000 extra luggage charge. I repeatedly said that it's cabin suitcase but they did not allowed as they wanted to make money.  I will never recommend this airline to anyone.,1
"Dont recommend. Originally flight from Jakarta to Singapore was canceled and we were rebooked 5 hours later. Multiple calls to support went unanswered. No response after two days to email ticket created through their support website. No response on Twitter. Service desk at CGK was vacant. Let the ads on the carry-on overhead bins be a signal: this is a bus with wings, so expect all the qualities of a bus company, not an airline.",1
"I had the most frustrating experience with IndiGo recently, I was flying from Vadodara to Mumbai, and later in the evening connecting on an international flight to the US. While I was aware that I was allowed only one bag, when I checked in with two bags, the counter staff calculated additional charges for Rs. 12,000! Please note that this is more than the charge for a round-trip ticket between Vadodara and Mumbai! I urged the staff, including the manager on duty, to reconsider as this made no sense, I even offered to buy them a round-trip ticket just to drop my extra bag off in Mumbai and return to Vadodara! While the ground staff was very courteous, I believe the airline's pricing strategy is blatantly skewed towards fleecing international travelers. On one hand IndiGo makes history by placing the single largest order of aircrafts at the Paris Air Show (which as a person of Indian origin, I am proud of), and, literally a week later I get to experience first hand how they plan to make money by fleecing the Indian diaspora on extra baggage fees!",1
"Where do I start? So my and daughter, son and other family members booked a flight to Bali. Flight was cancelled last minute. My daughter and son were split up and now in separate flights. Ok, 25 hours after first leaving planned flight my son finally flies out. Then sends me a pic taking off with duct tape on the aircraft wing. Not a small amount either. Pic below. My daughters bags were lost with baby formula in them. This airline is a disgrace and should be put out of business.",1
Flew JOG-KUL-RGN. Do not spend money on hot seat or pick a seat. Since boarding announcements are in local language first passengers rushed to the gates especially in small airports where there is not a dedicated line for hot seat passengers. When I asked staff at gate if everyone had hot seats they said yes! Pay for hot seats if you want bulk head or emergency exit seats for leg room. At end of purchase the website will give you seat assignments so don't bother paying for pick a seat either. Airplane and attendants are average for low cost carriers.,0
"We were travelling from Krabi to Jakarta, via Bangkok and when we arrived to Jakarta our luggage didn't arrive. We reported it lost at the CBTO office, they told us our bag was left behind in Bangkok and that they were going to send it back to Jakarta the next day at 3pm. We were flying back to the US next day so we couldn't claim it. It has been already 3 days since they got our luggage at CGK airport and they haven't done anything to get it back to us. We've been calling them many times and they either don't answer their calls or when they answer they hang up on us or they require us to provide a report ID number from the airline we flew back home so they can handover the bag to them. But, it's not that other airline's fault and because they don't have my luggage they can't give us a report ID number. It's not our fault, it should be the airline's responsibility to send the luggage to us. It has been a nightmare trying to get them send our luggage. Very inefficient staff in Jakarta. They don't respond to our emails and don't say anything about what they'll do with the luggage.",1
"Melbourne to Denpasar. Delays, cancellations, then more delays. Terrible service in the air and on the ground. Disorganized teams that were so accustomed to unhappy travelers, that they barely paid attention to our concerns. As a very experienced traveler, this was the worst experience I have endured. The first and last time I will fly Jetstar",1
6-10th Jan. PER-SIN-PER. Service in the cabin was non-existent I couldn't get anyone to come to my seat with my service light on for hours I gave up. Both flights there and back were cold particularly the outbound flight. The aircon was broken it was freezing and we weren't offered different seats even though there were many available that were much warmer. Eventually given a free blanket hours later. The sorting out of pre-booked meals is stupid. It takes hours to get all the pre-booked meals delivered and meanwhile there is no service from the cabin crew you cant get a drink or anything until about 2-3 hours into the flight. For these reasons I would only choose to fly Scoot again if the fare is very cheap.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Kuching with AirAsia. It was a good and smooth flight. Took less than the estimated time to arrive at the destination. Cabin crew was attentive and caring. The flight was delayed a bit, but I think that was normal for a domestic flight. Landing at KCH was okay. Overall, it was a good flight.",0
Phuket to Phnom Penh. Customer service is a disaster. My flight in March was cancelled which was a direct flight and I was offered a flight with stopover of 8 hrs. All attempts to get a customer service involved failed. The AVA Roboter thing is just a waste of time.,1
"Bangkok to Hat Yai. Lack of standard among ground staff. I pre-purchased 20kg of sport equipment baggage aiming to cover 2 bags of mine. (The combined weight of my 2 bags was 18kg.) A ground staff told me that I could only check in one bag and had to hand carry my other bag. Her reason was that the other bag could not be sport equipment! I've traveled with sport equipment several times with AirAsia, but this was the first time a ground staff refused to check in both bags because such staff believed that my other bag could not be sport equipment! I wonder why other ground staff from my previous flights never had a problem with me..",1
"Hobart to Sydney. Terrible airline, staff at the check in were great. Staff at boarding were horrible, unfriendly and issues with flight delays to and from. Charged 60 AUD for 3 KG of weight, price to pay ahead of check in was 30 AUD. Two + hour flight, no snack or drink. No in flight infotainment system, seats were very uncomfortable.",1
Hyderabad to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Because of delay of flight from Hyderabad we missed connecting flight and received a poor response from AirAsia staff in Malaysia airport,1
"Jetstar is by far the worst experience Ive ever had with an airline and I fly alot! Anything from service, communication and front desk staff are the worst! My flight home from Sydney to Melbourne was cancelled and I received no communication! Got to the airport only to find out the flight was cancelled. Front desk staff helped in putting me to a much later flight which would land in Avalon! I had to wait 3 hours at the airport and she had the audacity to say Im rude. I am furious to say the least. There is nothing that says quality about Jetstar. This definitely will be the last flight I ever have with Jetstar. They are not worth the cheap price I paid for. Pay more for Virgin and get all the quality service that you spend your money on. Jetstar is absolutely rubbish! I wouldnt recommend anyone to fly with them.",1
Sydney to Honolulu return. Seats are old and require repairs. The promoted Kooks wines were not available. Why promote wine if unavailable? Why does Jetstar charge people for every individual alcoholic drink? Cost of flight plus cost of meals wines etc. resulted into overall cost less competitive. Will look for another airline next time.,1
"Do not ever choose to fly Jetstar if you are doing business or need to be somewhere on time. My flight from Melbourne to Sydney in the morning was cancelled so I had to in turn, cancel my morning meeting in Sydney and reschedule others. My return flight the following day was also cancelled and I was offered to be rerouted via ""Brisbane"" which would have made the flight over 6.5 hours. This is not the first time that Jetstar has cancelled flights on me as I have had a flight overseas cancelled and missed a connecting flight back home. I have also had numerous flights cancelled and delayed nearly every time I have stupidly chosen to use JetStar. But it will be my last time as I will never choose to fly them again. Whatever you save on airfare you can potentially loose 100Ks of dollars on lost business deals. I even remember buying a flexi flight to try to prevent this for effecting me when I brought a flight forward to catch an earlier flight. Only to have this flight delayed so much that I watched the flight I was originally suppose to catch board 2 hours later as I still waited. The flight was eventually cancelled. Do not fly Jetstar if you cannot accept this happening at least 40% of the time.",1
Sydney to Cairns. Terrible experience at check-in. My husband and I traveled to Australia with his parlor guitar as he played at a wedding here. The airline would not let him carry on his 3/4 scale parlor guitar. Insisting it wouldnt fit in the plane and there was no way to even hand-check it as we boarded. This guitar has traveled all over the world in cabins without issue on much smaller planes. When we boarded the overhead bins were huge! Generous fit in even the smaller bins. The airline lied to us and lacked any sense of good judgement or customer service. We paid over a hundred dollars to store the guitar at the airport. Jetstar - today you earned passionate detractors. What a terrible experience for a working musician and tourist in your fine country. Virgin assured us they would have allowed it in their cabin. Last trip with Jetstar Airways. Badly done all around.,1
"Adelaide to Sydney. They canceled my flight because they didnt have enough staff, the link they provided in the e-mail didnt work, I called and I was on the line for over an hour an no one picked up (that was after couple of minutes of dealing with AI). There was a flight after my canceled flight but because if that it was booked fully, I called as a new customer and they picked up the phone immediately, they didnt provide any good solutions I asked for refund so I can go back with another airline but of course no refund, so I didnt make it back for my business and missed a lot of thing, I will never travel with Jetstar again.",1
"Putrid service thats all! Im not one to reviews and leave things as they are but this is just awful service and customer care. I was to take a flight out from New Plymouth to Auckland at 3.55pm at 12:30 pm they sent a message to say the flight is cancelled "" engineering issues"" luckily my connecting flight is only the next day but needed to be in auckland by this evening anyway. Called customer nothing they can do, mind you this is a return flight I had booked. Ask them if they could provide a vehicle for me to drive down to Auckland I would then make it by tonight they said no sorry that is not part of the options we can provide. My concern is, if you need to cancel a flight please do so 8 hours before departure this gibes passengers enough time to make alternative arrangements. I will certainly never fly with Jetstar again the airline is way to unreliable.",1
"Sydney to Adelaide. I was asked to weigh both my carry on in addition to my laptop. 1.5kg over the limit, I was forced to pay $65. What choice did i have. Then they tagged my bags with ""overweight"" tags which isn't true, individually they were under weight.  I won't be flying with them again. Not only did they charge $65 for me to get on the flight, but they delayed the flight by half an hour while they sorted out technical trouble concerning luggage.",1
"Zipair is JALs budget airline. They dont have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we arent used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you cant pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we werent allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldnt even change seats on board although the seat on my husbands left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you cant buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasnt enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping. Is that worth $5.5k - only you can answer that.",0
"Absolutely worst airline, best to avoid at all cost. Always late or cancelled, information and passenger support at airports is next to none. Gates change without notice. No compensation for delays or cancellations.",1
Honolulu to Hobart via Sydney. Jetstar took my money for bags and seat assignments then changed my flight to a Qantas flight and told me I could not get any seat assignments until I check in day of. It is a 10 hour flight that I have no control of where I sit. Will absolutely never fly with them again.,1
"I was late for boarding to Delhi from Gorakhpur airport. I reached at 15:10, my flight was at 15:40. The staff said, I am late, they were not allowing me to board. But with the support of two employees of Indigo Airlines Ruksar and Satendra are really nice people. They understand the situation. The two have been very helpful to me. She insisted on it and gave me my boarding pass. Thanks, Indigo must be proud both of you two.",0
"Chiang Mai to Singapore via Bangkok. I have no qualms with Air Asia flight. What I want to point out is whether Air Asia's website can be more user-friendly. For example, there is no ""manage my flight"" in the website, Web-check in was another headache. It was so difficult to do so as the website cannot find my flight despite keying in the booking reference number and correct full name! One has to sign in and view one's bookings in order to access the flight. Having succeeded in going to the web-check in page, I had to key in five passengers passports numbers and other details, But lo and behold when all done, I was told session timed out and everything I keyed in was gone. There was no warning whatsoever. I hope my experience is an isolated one. If not, Air Asia management needs to look in to this.",1
If I could give no stars I would. Seriously people stay away from them. Pay the bit extra and go with reputable company. They left my 15 year old daughter stranded in another state and then cancelled the rescheduled flight 3 days later! We ended up having to drive from Brisbane to Adelaide to get her.,1
My wife and I flew from Tokyo to Osaka. Flight itself was on time the inflight service was acceptable (we didn't pay for food which doesn't come free anyway) and the seats while a bit tight were OK for a flight of less than an hour. The on-the-ground service however left a lot to be desired. We missed both our inbound and outbound flights and both times we called ahead to explain our situation. The first time we were able to change our flight to an early one the next day! When we had to change our flight on the return flight the woman on duty refused to even look at us informing us tersely that there was nothing to be done but cancel or pay for another flight. We took ANA's Star Flight and had a much better experience with excellent service. Still a cheap airline but they seemed to understand their relationship with the customer.,1
5 October 2014 FD315 and D7 222. I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats. I will definitely fly AirAsia business class for an overnight flight again as long as it is affordable for me.,0
"We decided to travel with a carry-on suitcase and a hand bag. A surprise awaited me at the last stop, Manila - Dubai. After check-in at the airport, I received the boarding card, on the way to the boarding area, we were stopped by some people, they did not look like employees and did not allow us to go to our gate, they told us to go to hand over the luggage. I was at a loss as to why I had to return my hand luggage. In the end, it all ends with my ticket being taken away and being told to pay 5000, which is ~$100, on the grounds that you can only have one carry-on bag. I tried to understand why the amount is so high, no one explained anything to me and did not return the ticket until I paid.  I was shocked that they took our suitcases and then called a completely incomprehensible amount and made us pay it, only after paying they gave us flight tickets in check format. I will never fly with this terrible company Cebu Pacific again.",1
"My wife is going Brisbane to Melbourne for a funeral. Gets to the boarding gate an hour early and Jetstar staff are weighing everyone's luggage. My wife's carry on was a kilo or two over limit because she didn't read the fine print and didn't realise that a handbag was included.  Happy to pay a little extra for the couple of kilos overweight. However, $60.00 or couldn't board flight. That's nearly the cost of an entire ticket! Come on Jetstar, I'm sure some of the people behind her in line would have weighed 30kg more than her. Utter joke, made a stressful time for her even more stressful; not to mention embarrassing. Will never fly with them again or recommend to anyone.",1
We chose Zipair because the business class seats were incredibly reasonable. The check-in process was easy and quite professional. Boarding was easy. The flight was great with the seats that went flat and allowed us to sleep a bit on a 9 hour flight. The food we pre-ordered was pretty good for airline food. The only negative is that the cabin crew never came by to check on whether we needed anything. Not a big deal. We think that Zipair is a very decent airline and hope we have the chance to fly again soon. My wife loved the business class seats. We got to LAX feeling better after a long flight than we ever have. Thank you!,0
As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. Never again.,1
"Melbourne to Singapore. Good value for money, despite it was below of our expectation. It is the least comfortable Boeing 787-8 I have traveled in business class with a 2-3-2 configuration and we were in the 3. It is good value as it includes 30Kg of luggage, food, in-flight entertainment for an 8 hour flight. Food quality and service was acceptable to good.",0
"This is a warning about checkin at Narita. The self checkin machines dont work. If you are not automatically checked in by the airline, dont bother trying to use these machines. We were sent on a run around by their ground staff and by the time they tried to help us self checkin, there was a huge line for the counter. Fortunately we got to the airport early. The ZIPAIR staff seem clueless & kept asking folk to use the self check in. Not typical Japanese efficiency. I guess you get what you pay for. Note too that biz class doesnt have a separate checkin line. Id recommend this airline only because they have the cheapest lie flat biz class seats on this route",0
"About 6 years ago I swore never to fly on Jetstar again, unfortunately urgent circumstances required my family and I to fly from Auckland to Wellington NZ. Normally we would have taken an Air New Zealand flight, but flights all full and we had a time dealing to get to Wellington. Cramped seating, and sub standard service from start to finish pretty much sums up this awful excuse for an airline. Qantas must be ashamed to have an association Jetstar. We get to Wellington and in a rush to make a function and in true Jetstar form, no bags arrive off the conveyor. After almost 20 minutes and about 40 plus customers all standing about awaiting bags, several customers like myself started making approaches to Jetstar. Apparently the machine that unloads luggage from the plane is broken and they didn't have another. Made worse because they were too cheap to hire one from Air NZ to get the plane unloaded. 50 minutes later customers were starting a small riot wanting to know what was going on. Jetstar never made any PA announcements, nor did they apologise when we finally got luggage 1.25 hours after the flight landed. They aren't a cheap airline to fly on anyway. By the time you buy a ticket, then a meal, pay extra for a bag etc, you could have purchased an economy ticket on another airline and had all the extras for free and excellent service.",1
Bali to Kuala Lumpur. The ticket amount excludes check in baggage which we did not notice while booking.  We had to add 25 kg luggage allowance at 3050 extra. There was no free food and not even a free cup of water on this low-cost airline. At Bali airport we reached 2 hr before and were waiting for boarding at designated gate. We just escaped missing our flight as they changed gate before 1 hr.,1
By far the worst overall flight experience I have had in my life. Customer service was embarrassingly bad and no-one could help or speak English. App was awful and initially took my money without giving me a flight and took IndiGo 2 weeks to refund. The flight I did manage to book was more expensive than the initial one and that was fine with IndiGo. Seats on the plane were very cheap and uncomfortable (never seen that before). Best to avoid if at all possible.,1
"Darwin - Sydney 9 June. A320. 2 PAX. Given it was a ""red-eye"" special with 0200 hrs departure for a low cost carrier this was a pleasant flight. Airport Counter check-in staff helpful and efficient. A request for exit row seats was granted without fuss or attempts of extortion for more money. Flight departed early arrived on time. Cabin temperature suitable for relaxed sleeping and managed to get 3 hrs sleep. Crew professional. Tickets were purchased 6 months in advance and for the cost of $109 pp - it really was excellent value for a flight duration of 4.5 hours.",0
"Flew from Melbourne to Bangkok with Jetstar Airways. It was the best flight, service, food etc. we have experienced in the last 5 years. Courtesy and work ethic of the Thai cabin crew was excellent. Food and drinks were quality all the way. Short delay before take-off for technical fault. Much better than many 'full service airlines' we have flown recently.",0
"My new husband and I are using this airline for our honeymoon. First thing that went wrong is that our flight from Melbourne to Cairns (JQ940) was cancelled in the middle of the night. So lucky my husband woke up and saw the message, and we spent three hours in the crazy hours of the morning trying to find another flight that would get us to Cairns on the same day. The lack of flight choice without ridiculous stopovers was appalling. And thanks to the airline, we lost an entire day of our trip. But thats not all. Before we left for our honeymoon, Jetstar told us that our flight home was rescheduled to be earlier. Which was disappointing because we were going to lose another day of our honeymoon. And once again, this morning we received a message in the middle of the night, telling us our flight (JQ941) has been delayed. Well, our hotel front reception werent in until 9am to help rearrange a later shuttle bus, so we had to suck it up and head to the airport to wait four hours for our flight. But then, about 10 minutes before our new boarding time, the departures sign showed that our flight would be further delayed by another two hours. So basically, thats over 6 hours of us dragging around the airport, wasting our time and holiday. Im currently in Cairns airport as I write this, trying to get back home to Melbourne, really upset. Wheres the communication? No text, no email, the app is all incorrect information. Wheres the staff that we can talk to? And with all the delays put together, its literally back to the original flight time we had when we booked. If we had known this earlier than 4am, then we could have spent another day enjoying our honeymoon. All up, Id say we lost two days worth of our honeymoon, just from Jetstar flight delays and cancellations. I probably will never fly Jetstar again. I have never had a problem in the past, and its so upsetting watching all the Qantas and Virgin flights go home.",1
CNX-KUL return. As I seldom have checked baggage using the stand alone machines for check-in is a breeze especially as most people don't use them! Flight itself was fine although it was a confusing route march to get to the aircraft. Also having a flight to Chennai at roughly the same time seemed to confuse some passenger. Reasonable cabin crew. I ordered meals in advance and they were onboard although I was listed as a 'no-show' on the manifest. Return to CNX the breakfast pancakes were cold and trying to get the packet of maple syrup open was like a challenge from a game show. Flights were punctual and the return 25 minutes early.,0
Singapore to Jakarta. This plane looks outside and feel very old inside. Overhead compartments in our row are being filled up by passengers sitting in the far back; that's 4 of us seated in 1 row with just 1 carry-on and yet no space in both side of our overhead compartments ! The staff requested we checked in our hand carry which inconvenient us since we put our important items in there. We have to take almost everything out and put them in a plastic bag so we can put them in the pouch in front of our seat while the carry-on bag was checked-in.,1
Check in agent was rude and onboard we found female FA also rude probably due to early morning flight. The Captain kept updating us the fight path announcement. The seat was cramped at seat 22F. The food is hot but portion was too small. They offer do wifi connection onboard this aircraft (chargeable). For the related experience we will not fly AK again.,1
"Quick check in, followed by efficient and punctual boarding. Buses in great condition. Newer aircrafts. Smiling and professional cabin crew. Captains update passengers regularly with clear announcements. Although it is a low cost carrier, a bit more cushioning on seats would be great. All in all, highly recommended, at least for Indian domestic sector.",0
"They don't answer your calls, respond to live chat or even turn up at the airport to tell you your flight is cancelled. What I witnessed tonight at Ho Chi Minh Airport deeply disturbed me. Old people, families, budget travellers - queuing up in preparation for a flight, coming to the realisation after no one turned up or messaged up or contacted anyone, that no flight was leaving. I will never fly this airline again.",1
Denpasar to Perth. Really impressed. Good service on a clean plane. Was quite expensive so doing Jetstar on return. Would use again. Only negative was boarding via buses rather than a gate.,0
"I was flying from Melbourne to Tokyo via Cairns last month with Jetstar and it went fairly well. Unfortunately upon landing into Cairns we were told that our connecting flight on to Tokyo had been cancelled due to a bird strike on the aircraft. I must say the ground staff at Cairns handled the cancelled flight really well and professionally and I was pretty impressed. I was accomodated onto the next flight for Japan, which was within two hours, and was even able to get a coffee and cake at the cafe inside while I was waiting. The only problem was I had to go to Osaka airport instead of Tokyo (I've lived in Japan for over two years so I at least knew what I was in for) The problem I did have though was when I tried to claim the unexpected costs of transferring back to Tokyo once I arrived. I chatted to staff online and they were brilliant, very understanding and professional the entire time. Even when I had to explain the situation a few times to different people. Once I had a manager assigned to my case it was resolved within a few days. I was really impressed with how the situation was resolved with minimal fuss. I believe the IM function on the website is an excellent addition to their customer service toolbox and made contacting them while overseas really painless. I am really impressed with the level of customer service I recieved from everyone throughout the journey and helping with my issues. I would definitely recommend travelling internationally with them again. The flight itselft was great, the new Boeing 787 that operate the Australia to Japan routes are amazing, quite spacious (I'm 187cm tall), comfy and clean.",0
"I took two flights, from Melbourne to Darwin and then onto Singapore. Going onto the first flight the attendant stood and weighed passengers bags on boarding and snarled at those over or unfortunate enough to carry two bags (regardless of size) to enter the Extra cost line.  I was gutted I had no alternative to board the flight because of my existing plans. The staff were rude to me on both flights, they stood talking about customers in direct ear shot of the rest of us. I was looked at with disgust because I asked for a glass of water when they were offering paid for cups of tea, my water never arrived so I went thirsty.",1
"We had confirmed our ticket on 22/07/2022. During confirmation they provided me a seat, which was 9D. But, during the period of Boarding they changed my seat to 33 D without any prior notification.  Their luggage handling system tore my luggage cover and there were several scratched on our luggage. They had boarded us on air bridge before making the aircraft ready. For this reason we had to wait on air bridge almost 20 minutes.",1
"We are extremely disappointed with Indigo Airline services. I was travelling with my family and 2 years old daughter from Ahmedabad to Mumbai in domestic Indigo flight # 6E6794 on 14th Feb 2023. Unfortunately for some reason Indigo flight was delayed AS ALWAYS. The flight was supposed to fly 10:20 PM but it took off by 11:05 PM. Even thought the flight took off so late, the airline must cover up the time gap to reach Mumbai airport on time but in this case they didn't make an effort to do so. We reached extremely late at Mumbai International airport that the check-in counter was closed for my next connecting flight (Cathay Pacific) from Mumbai to Vancouver. Immediately we had to book another flight from Lufthansa and spend CAD 4500. This is extremely disappointing and we would not prefer to travel with Indigo Airlines ever again.",1
Bangkok (Don Mueang) - Hat Yai return with Thai Lion Air. A mix experience from pleasant to fair enough. Booking system and online check - in fine their website is easy. Staff very friendly polite and professional. Aircraft is brand new 737-900er with Sky interior look nice and exit row are comfortable. On the return flight my preferred seat request is refused despite it being available regular seat are tight cramp and very uncomfortable. Hot meal sold on board had run out  only instant noodle or snack available. Crew are apologetic with the problem and tried to accommodate other request. Punctuality is perfect. Expense wise their fare are cheap and include all those miscellaneous cost (eg. tax and VAT) 15kgs load luggage free. Will not hesitate to fly them again at this cost and level of service.,0
"Phuket to Melbourne. Ive never had a worse flight experience than what I experienced with Jetstar International. I flew from Melbourne to Phuket first and incurred issues with the staff. The service was absolutely horrible. Not once did staff walk through the cabin to offer water to passengers on a 9 hour flight, nor did they comply with our requests when we asked for water. I had to call staff multiple times over several hours before receiving a small cup of water. I also paid for comfort packs and received them two hours into the flight. The flight back to Melbourne from Phuket was delayed 6.5 hours making me miss my domestic flight back to Adelaide and requiring extra accommodation to be purchased. All the airline gave passengers for this inconvenience was a $20 food voucher when in reality, many, like myself paid $600+ due to their inconvenience. I would not recommend flying Jetstar under any circumstance. Staff do not seem to have any consideration toward passengers and overall service was appalling.",1
"We were traveling back from Hyderabad to Bangalore with our 85 year old mother and young children. The flight was delayed by 90 minutes in total and instead of arriving at 10.30pm we arrived at 12.05am. We had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate, we were advised to go back and sit. As the passengers were coming through the passage we couldn't make our way back to the seats. The air hostesses were extremely rude, repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats. They were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone. They asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious. In summary an extremely annoying experience, air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude, intolerant and unwilling to listen.",1
"Phuket to Singapore. Dont take scoot often, But always feel the cabin crew are the best. Its common that passengers carry heavy luggage on board, although its cabin size, but heavier than the allowable weight of 7kg. No matter how full the flight and how full the overhead compartment, they will try to help passengers to put the luggage into the compartment. Suggest all the ground check in counter to check passengers hand carry and weight, when necessary, force them to check in the overweight Luggage.",0
Melbourne to Singapore. Having read over and over again how bad the budget internationals were I was amazed at the value for money you get when traveling with Jetstar. Sure the food was not 5 star but it was edible the seats were comfortable staff friendly and overall for the price I paid ($324 return) how could you expect more. It amazes me that people whinge about budget airlines and compare them to full cost airlines. Overall very happy.,0
Flying on A320 Sharklet from SYD to ADL JQ764. Cabin is a bit aged but clean and crews are friendly. A little delay due to a technical fault on the ancillary generator on the rear but the Captain recovered the lost time during the flight. Seat is more comfortable and spacious compare to Qantas 737-800 which I took on my return flight.,0
"Smooth experience from check-in until arrival. The flight is on time and proper boarding announcements and arrangements. The is no IFE but we can connect to wifi for entertainment - the Wi-Fi connection was pretty bad. The pre-booked food was good. Smooth take-off and landing. The cabin crew was super nice. Overall, very moderate experience with this airline.",0
"They cancelled the flight 48hrs before departure. Contacted the call centre and given the option of a travel voucher or alternative travel date to the same destination a week later, only to be told they cannot guarantee that flight won't be cancelled as well. Asked if we could be transferred to a Qantas flight operating on the same day to the same destination and apparently this is not an option. I love how Jetstar choose to act and associate themselves with Qantas when it suits them. Even the survey they want you to fill out regarding the call centre phone call is from Qantas. Yet they're unwilling to help customers who still need to travel to their destination on their partner airline. Now we have to spend 14hrs in the car driving to the Gold Coast. Thanks a lot, Jetstar for a disappointing start to our holiday. I'll know better next time.",1
"Flew from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Boarding was fast, by 8.30 all passengers had boarded. There was no pre-departure announcement by the captain, only mid-air and before descent announcements were made. The 2nd service cart was very slow in the beginning. Flight was generally pleasant all the way. Landing was good. A new food container was used, and I found it easier to use and dispose of. For the first time (for me), the head cabin crew announced on the separation of rubbish between recyclables and non-recyclables, into white and green plastic bags. Congrats, AirAsia.",0
Took the KUL-CGK-KUL on AK386 and QZ202 respectively. Cabin crew were awesome and very good. Food was ok but could add more menus and add more spices to the food.,0
"Penang to Langkawi. s overall a good experience, Check in was a little confusing as you have to label your own bags. There was a staff member on hand to assist if needed though. The line was a bit long and slow, Boarding was so organised, everyone had a line to be in which was according to seat number, very efficient, The plane seemed new, the seats were very comfortable, it was a very short flight yet it was surprising sine had ordered food however it wasn't served due to turbulence which was a surprise as we felt none, It was a nice flight and now I am seriously considering Air Asia for future flights - it was much nicer than the Malaysia Airlines domestic flights,",0
"Arrived at terminal to see on the departure board that my flight was delayed. I was not notified by email or text that it had been delayed. If I had been, I would have left a lot later from home. Then it was delayed, a second time. I'm now waiting almost 3 hours to get on a flight which takes 50 minutes to get to my destination. I asked the reception workers what is going on, they have no answer. I have never had issues with Air NZ, they always communicate any delays via email. If I had more money I would have flown with them. Jetstar, you need to improve your services. This is unacceptable! Do you even bother to read your reviews? So many negative reviews, I'm surprised that you get any business. I will not be traveling with you again.",1
"They try hard to deny a refund even though I did not get the front row seat which I paid for. Apparently, there was an aircraft change and they did not change my seat at check in or at the boarding gate. When I proved that they screw up, they finally offered to refund, by asking you to acknowledge the offer of course hoping that you will decline.",1
Melbourne to Singapore with a stopover in KUL. Plane was clean with comfortable lighting. The seat's pitch is not a problem but the issue lies with the amount of shoulder space between passengers. There is just not enough space if you have broad shoulders. The seats are comfortable for smaller builds only. I had to lean on one side throughout my 8 hour flight. The poor quality padding starts to present itself about 2 hours into flight. The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value. I personally would prefer more space on long haul flights. Again what you pay is what you get.,0
MEL to BKK on day time flight. Departure delayed by passengers who failed to board with their luggage needing to be off loaded. Kept informed of progress. Quicker than scheduled flight meant only a 10 minute delay in arrival. Food was surprisingly good better than domestic business and international premium economy on QF but not international business standard. Beverage selection excellent. You can choose from the entire for sale menu from the economy cabin at any time which gives you access to a much wider selection of mid flight snacks than could be offered on a full service airline. Seat is same as QF domestic business so again not a true long haul business seat. IFE on ipads with enough selection to keep you occupied. The highlight was the service from an enthusiastic and happy crew. This flight exceeded our expectations.,0
Kuala Lumpur to Penang. Book 1st flight 5.25am for 2 person because very cheap at less than RM100. Arrived at check in kiosk 4.30am. Counter informed check in close 1 hour before flight. So no choice bought the following flight as the next flight closing in 20 minutes. Whopping 280 per person and for 2 person 560 plus. No choice paid as need to meet appointment. Boarding pass handed only notice hot seat. No wonder so expensive. I was not told whether normal seat available or not. Very costly in the end.,1
"Singapore to Surabaya. Flight departed and arrived about 45 minutes late. No Indonesian customs forms were provided to passengers, which is unusual. Other than these, it was a usual budget flight with no free food and jaded crew.",0
MAA-BLR and BLR-BOM with a young family. Both flights were on time the aircraft were clean and the FAs very friendly and accommodating. Whilst we could not check in online with young children for some reason the check in staff ensured we were allotted the seats we requested. Staff were also flexible with us checking in most of our luggage (and exceeding the 15kg/person) instead of taking a carry on bag for each of the children making our lives easier. Bags were delivered even before we reached the belt in both cases. Streets ahead of Easyjet and Ryanair. The only domestic airline I ever book in India.,0
"Gold Coast to Sydney, Jetstar pulled us aside and weighed our carry including my Partners hand bag and charges us $120 for being 1Kg over. Handbag was weighed on top of our allowed 7kg. Boycot Jetstar, they are the worst airline. No voucher or anything will get us back.  This is not the first time we are disappointed. No more Jetstar even if its for free.",1
"Singapore to Melbourne. For the price it is excellent no frills, just pay for services that you require. Ensure you have a embossed credit / debit card, or take cash. Singaporean visa / master cards not accepted in flight unless they are embossed. Some staff wont take your card, but explain to them, and try - it works. Overnight flights can get cold so take a blanket, or buy on-board. And if you are leaving any airport other than Singapore, pay the extra for priority check in. well worth it!",0
"Melbourne to Cairns, flight was delayed by 1 hours.  Staff was terrible and rude, staff on flight JQ944 told us to stop our daughter - she was just playing with my husband and walking between his seat to mine. We told her that we are telling but its hard if we force her she will cry and people sleeping on plane. Instead she told us that she is a mother and know how to control kids and she questioned our parenting and she did it twice.",1
"Terrible check-in experience at the Melbourne Airport, don't expect a smooth process even if you are in business class. Our check-in bags came to 31.5kg, just 1.5kg over the allocated 30kg that came with the ScootBiz ticket. The airline ground check-in staff would not allow us 1-2 kg over for check-in baggage, even when we were on business class. The check-in staff were more interested in getting extra $$$ for the excess 2 kg with lots of fuss, hassles, toing and froing, they even forgot to ask basic security questions about the baggage content as you would expect check-in staff from other airlines to do. Also they don't have priority baggage tags for business class passengers like other airlines such as AirAsia. So much for paying the extra money for ScootBiz ticket, the check-in experience certainly did not feel business class. The airline's draconian strict baggage policy and the inexperienced check-in ground staff made the trip really unpleasant. Would not book with them again.",1
"Scheduled to fly on jetstar at 1.30pm to the Gold Coast for a wedding. Left my work early, flight was cancelled with no other Jetstar flight to board. We had to be placed on a Virgin flight at 6.45pm that evening. Missed out on family gathering. No explanation from jetstar as to what happened. Melbourne is the second biggest city in Australia and Jetstar can't get there act together.",1
Seoul-Manila-Seoul satisfactory for a low cost airline. Check-in smooth. I didn't buy any food because it seemed mostly unappealing. The return flight was extremely turbulent and although the turbulence was obviously not the fault of the airline it would have been good to hear some kind of announcements of reassurance from the captain as the atmosphere in the cabin was very tense for most of the flight.,0
"If you're a person with a disability, do not travel with Air Asia from Don Mueang Airport. You will have to climb the stairs to get on the plane. Even if you pay 600 Thai bahts for the wheelchair service, this stops at the departure gate! A family member or friend can do it. I guess they don't want to pay for direct access to their aircraft? Of course the bus does not stop at the edge of the platform, you'll have to get down a high step and then get on the bus, one more step. Then get off the bus, one more step and a nice stair is waiting for you and your disability! In fact, Air Asia has changed its slogan: ""Now the disabled can walk"" And Don Mueang airport is changing its name, it is now the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes Airport! The place where miracles happen, in this case, it's a paid miracle, a miracle that will never happen.",1
Pleasant surprise! Even if check-in was somewhat chaotic (in Krabi) the flight experience was nice. Clean plane comfortable seats and nice crew. Will fly them again and the prices are great.,0
"Hong Kong to Perth via Singapore with Scoot. Was very pleased with the handling of the situation when we missed our flight to Perth after a six hour delay in Hong Kong. Meal vouchers were given and was adequate if eating at the local food hall. As always was wise to take out insurance to cover just this sort of situation as we had to stay a couple of extra nights in Singapore. Would have been nice if we could have had some sort of corporate discount with accommodation. In Singapore Airport getting our bags was another issue. Was delayed for a time and could not find our bags till we started filling a lost and claim form it turned up. All in all an experience, but love Singapore so was not fuzzed by having to stay a couple of extra nights. Happy with the premium economy upgrade on our trip back to Perth.",0
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The flight departed late, I had to wait about an hour. There was a technical difficulty, it seemed. The announcement about the delayed departure was made at the airport about 30 minutes before departure, and through email, which surprised me since the email was received shortly before the originally scheduled flight should have left. The flight went well.",0
"Butuan City to Manila return trip. Both flights were a breeze, from easy online check in to boarding. I didn't buy extra baggage allowance so I went directly to the boarding area. It is almost summer in the Philippines so it was a beautiful day to fly complimented by Cebu Pacific's on-time flight, one cannot ask for more. Cabin was clean and well-maintained. Great crew from ground to sky. Highly recommended.",0
"Bali to Melbourne. I passed through all checks got to the gate area found a seat to wait to board (almost fell asleep, nice) then everyone was asked to get up leave and return for a 2nd check at the same gate area! I'm all for security but I was airside by this stage. Had a very basic bag check (again) then took my original seat in the lounge.",1
"Davao to Manila with Cebu Pacific last January 26 for a supposedly 09:30 am flight but plane took off at 12:00 noon due to ""delayed arrival of assigned aircraft"". Once aircraft arrived got delayed by another 30 mins due to ""traffic congestion in Manila Airport"". So all in all arrived in Manila a good 2 hours late. I can consider myself lucky though as one flight to Tagbilaran was cancelled due to ""technicial issues of assigned aircraft"". Bombarded with delays while same destination Philippine Airlines (PAL) flights in the other departure lounge were flying on schedule. Cebu Pacific is king of delays/cancellation.",1
"Very smooth and efficient trip with an on time performance. Please forward appreciation to the friendly and very professional customer service agent Vagneshwari (forgive me if I misspell the name) based at TRZ airport. A very informative customer service minded Check in/gate agent who guided and took her time to get to know the passenger. I travel frequently worldwide and this is not common nowadays, even from the biggest carriers. This was my first Indigo flight, had some difficulties on the app/website paying for the seat due to international card, and the snacks menu onboard could offer more. Will surely choose this carrier from now on if I get the chance due to the great experience!",0
"The check-in at KLIA LCCT was chaotic. I took the 10pm flight from KUL to PEN on 27th August (after a very good flight on AirAsia Premium from SYD). I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers. AirAsia is a real mess at LCCT. I have taken more than 50 AA flights including KUL PEN JHB SIN. KUL LCCT is shameful a disappointment to what is otherwise a great Low-Cost Airline.",0
JQ 29 MEL-BKK on B787. First trip on the 'Dreamliner' which might as well be named 'Nightmareliner'. I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner. Wouldn't go out of my way to fly either Jetstar or their B787.,1
We flew international from Sydney to Nadi (Fiji). I was extremely impressed with Jetstar. Flight left on time was smooth and cabin crew were well presented and courteous. They were very accommodating to my 23 month old who cried most of the light. We bought some food from menu all reasonably priced and the tablets were better than Virgin ie better range of children's movies/shows. The flight was not full so I was able to have 3 seats to myself. Toilets were clean and functional. I would defiantly fly Jetstar again.,0
"General Santos to Manila. Cebu Pacific has one of the youngest average fleet age. The staff, especially flight attendants, is eager to help the passengers. They have no IFE, but they  host these trivia games where three passengers can possibly win prizes. Their catering is good too, although no much variant, its a great value. I've flown with them 5 times now and all delays I've experienced is caused by air traffic congestion in Manila.",0
"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. Appreciate the supervisor on our flight to HCM . My husband is elderly and uses a walking stick and has weakness in his legs. When he boarded the flight, the supervisor noticed he was a bit unsteady at the entrance & was kind enough to allocate us a seat near the front 3 D/E, instead of our counter allocated seats in row 30. On our return flight, the counter supervisor also kindly asked the booking staff to allocate us a seat near the entrance, again it happened to be 3 D&E. We thank the attentive staff for their assistance.",0
"I've flown Air Asia a lot, so I think it's time I finally gave them a review. I've taken many of the budget airlines in Southeast Asia, but Air Asia remains my favorite. In fact, I think Air Asia may even be better than some of the full carriers in the area. I've flown Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, Singapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai to Singapore, Jakarta to Yogyakarta, and the Singapore/Jakarta route several times. I never had any problems with any of my flights. None of my flights were ever delayed, which definitely can't be said for the other airlines I've taken around Southeast Asia. Their app also works well, but it's only available for use at certain airports. The ground staff is can sometimes seem a bit course, but they are efficient and get the job done. Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead. Overall, i recommend Air Asia whenever you're looking for basic service to get you where you have to go quickly and cheaply.",0
