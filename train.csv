Have made numerous Cebu Pacific flights throughout Asia within the Philippines flights are generally good value for money but strict on baggage allowance. Found at BKK staff standing on edges of baggage scales adding between 2-5kg to actual weight of baggage so allowing them to claim excess baggage fees. My last flight from UK was weighed for internal UK flight at 23kg this was the same for my international flight from UK to Manila but for my internal flight from Manila to Cebu my baggage had suddenly gained 5.5kg in weight to 28.5kg - so excess baggage fees charged!,0
"Melbourne to Singapore. We booked the seats with extra leg space and even then the seats were very narrow and the arm rest could not be lifted so the hip space was very small. The service of the air steward and stewardesses was awful as well. My parents are Indians and thus when they speak English, they have a thick Indian accent and they tend to speak slowly. However, instead of listening to what they were saying patiently, a stewardess just rolled her eyes which was rude. My family and I are vegetarians so we had bought some food in the airport to eat in the plane. We have done this before during traveling. However, the steward told us outside food was not allowed and so we told them this time we had already brought the food and we wouldn't do it next time while traveling. However, a steward kept glaring at us each time he walked past. I have never seen service where the flight attendants are so rude.",1
Thought we would give them a try as fares were reasonable but it's nowhere near business class good legroom on seats but more like a bad premium economy. Crew weren't really interested in customers. 30-40 minutes for them to answer a call for a drink on TZ1 Sydney to Singapore on the way back they were quicker. In scoot biz you can bring your own device for entertainment and not be charged everyone who I saw couldn't get it to work. Crew were more interested in chatting in the galley than helping. Try another airline.,1
"We flow from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta and Jakarta to Singapore with Lion Air. I didn't expect much in terms of customer care and service and choose this airline merely for its cheap offers. However, I was quite impressed of this airline for several reasons: 1) There was no cancellation or any delay of our two legs with Lion Air. 2) I found the crew very polite, they had a smile on their faces while welcoing passengers during boarding. 3) I was also very impressed witnessing the staff helping passengers actively with storing their big and heavy bags onto overhead bins, this is a touch that you wouldn't see with European crews. 4) Crew engaged in emergency instructions. They briefed passengers in the exit rows about their duties. There was a seat empty on the exit row so a cabin member was asking people if they would like to sit in the exit row. 5) Crew were not good with English skills, their airline magazine also has no english content at all. 6) Price was amazing compared to other carriers. Full service carrirers such as Malaysia and Garuda wanted 4 times as much money as Lion Air. 7) Seat was comfortable with old fashinoned leather which I do prefer over these new but thin and hard seats from many carriers. Leg space was limited but acceptable for a 2 hours flight.",0
"Flew Jetstar Airways to Bali a few months ago on the recommendation of a travel agent, and once again to Phuket last week. Never again ! Improvements must be implemented urgently. Cabin crew were noticeably inattentive, to the extent that rubbish piled up on tray tables. I asked for a blanket due to a sudden drop in cabin temperature but was told the airline did not carry any (despite) the seat in front of me being supplied with one. Worst of all - one of the cabin crew picked up a large bottle of water (in front of me), drank from that bottle and replaced it on the tray with other bottles - presumably for use with other guests. A health issue? Surely a very serious lapse of standard practices which management must address.",1
"Lombok to Guangzou via Kuala Lumpur. Not able to link my luggage through for my total flight, as it is a low cost airline. During the flight the intercom was only quiet for about 10 minutes. A constant voice making it impossible to sleep/relax. If you want food you needed to pay for it, although it wasn't possible with credit card. By far the worst experience I've had with an Asian airline.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. Customer service was not friendly at all. I was traveling with a guitar which has fitted in the smallest of overhead compartments, but they would not let me carry it on. When I asked if it would make the trip checked in, she just had me sign a liability release form. She would not let me fly without signing this form. Then, she charged me for the guitar as ""oversized baggage"" which on any other Airline, and every other Airline on which I've traveled, it qualified as a carry on. She also stated I never claimed any baggage on my reservation. I told her I never had the option, but she argued with me stating the option was there, when in fact, I booked the travel and there was no option through that agency. The representative was rude and unwavering, and an absolutely poor representative of any Airline, of all Airlines I have flown. Based on this experience with her, I would not recommend Jetstar Airways to anyone.",1
"Flight on Christmas morning from Melbourne to Adelaide cancelled, just before checking in. Sydney flight same day also cancelled. Reason for both: sudden technical problems. Return flight, three days later from Adelaide, also cancelled an hour before departure. Reason: unexpected mechanical problems, again. Upon asking Adelaide staff about routine maintenance, we were told ""an aircraft is not serviced like a car, it can break down any time"".  Lost a day's wages as the offered return flight left the next day only.",1
How can you take the latest greatest most modern aircraft flying (787 Dreamliner) and make it so damn uncomfortable? I have just returned from a holiday to Bali and flew Jetstar. I was actually quite excited to be flying the 787 for the first time after all the hype about comfort air quality bigger windows and low noise levels. What an enormous disappointment. Jetstar have managed to take such an advanced and modern aircraft and jam it with cramped seats down in economy with terrible leg room. I am not even that big 175cm. It looks like they had a team from Tupperware design and install the entire interior of this plane. Plastic everywhere. The food (pre-purchased) was marginal at best and it'll cost you $10 to watch a movie. You go to all that trouble of installing screens in the back of the seat and it seemed hardly anyone bothered paying. The actual inflight experience (bigger windows air quality and smooth flight) was OK - and I am looking forward to flying the 787 again with an airline that actually designed a cabin with a hint of passenger comfort in mind. Thankfully it's only a 6 hour run up to Bali and slightly shorter coming home. Honestly Qantas Group - you should have kept the Dreamliner for the 'nicer' brand - and given you old bangers to 'little brother' Jetstar.,1
"My 77-year-old father was flying Indigo from Abu Dhabi to Kochi, 6E 1404. It was delayed by more than 1.5 hours last night and as scheduled, it was due to depart from Abu Dhabi Terminal 1. After arriving at the airport, we then found out that check-in was moved to T3 and boarding was back at T1. My father faced a lot of inconvenience in lost time and stress due to which he couldn't use the lounge prior to departure. Very frustrated withIndigo Airlines.",1
"The worst airline ever. I booked food but received none. I bought more but it was awful, they didn't even give water. The flight was delayed of course! The toilet stank. Never again.",1
We were made to stop for an additional bag check after doing through the standard immigration and international security. This was just before take off whilst waiting for boarding. They took away my water I had just purchased and food. I've never had this check done before and I would say it is almost certainly to make you buy something on the plane. This is forcing you to buy through them which surely is against certain rules / processes.,1
Delhi to Goa. Had read some negative reviews so was slightly apprehensive. I shouldnt have worried this was an excellent airline for a low cost carrier. Everything was exceptional from check in to boarding. The crew were so immaculately groomed and the cabin service was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. They worked hard to ensure that the cabin was as tidy as possible to enable a quick turn round for the return flight. Maybe other low cost carriers should have a look at Indigo to see how its done!!,0
"Poor ground service, they asked me to check in my hand baggage for excess weight, which I understand is the rule. But when I was boarding the aircraft, I was amazed to find that loads of passengers had huge hand bags and in some cases multiple bags, which possibly were more than the weight limit. The ground staff told me that they check the weight again at the boarding gate to ensure that there is no overweight baggage, but I did not see any other bag being weighed other than mine!",1
"Singapore to Taipei. Two weeks before my flight, Scoot cancel the flight and simply sent an email to notify passenger reschedule to next day without and reimbursement to passenger. If passenger not accept reschedule, passenger had to call in Scoot helpline. The helpline totally disable, tried call 3-5 times with waiting more than 1 hour and finally reach the operator to answer. The operator was unfriendly and keep asking passenger to accept. I'm booking front seat with paid. but Scoot operator like act blur and because A320 was cancel changed to Boeing 787. And to continue get the front seat i still need to top up another $23 and get the same day flight and late for 3 hours flight. For the return flight, the flight is scheduled depart on 16.10, but take off time was 17.00 due to unknown reason at Taipei airport. Totally horrible services provided. For return, I paid for front window seat, but the seat is so near to the window and not comfortable. i will not take Scoot again, even thought they willing to bring down the price. They are a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, but their service is totally different and the attitude is bad to passenger.",1
"MAA-HYD. The crews are friendly the airplanes clean they still run a largely on-time operation and prices remain very affordable. The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment. Even worse if you have to make a change to your reservation the ""convenience fee"" is charged every time you make a change. IndiGo is unfortunately picking up the bad habits of the Spirits and Ryanairs of the world though at least the service is very good for now anyway.",0
Manila-Butuan/Manila-Cebu round trip: The price was really cheap but it fired me back with 3 hour delayed flight and overpriced meal (cup of water - 50 Pesos) seriously? From the airport the first checked in bag cost me 540Pesos (around $12) for only 15kilos which was really pricey for local travelers. The flight was not that smooth but the flight attendants were really polite. This flight is not recommended for travelers with international connecting flights on the same day. This is a really time consumable flight in exchange of lower price.,1
Our flight was diverted on the way to Phuket and we were dumped in Bangkok at midnight with no information let alone a hotel. Over 200 passengers were forced to fight for 8 available hotel rooms that they had to pay for themselves. After over a 12 hour wait the flight then boarded again but was then further delayed as they had messed up the luggage getting to the plane. It ended up with bags on the tarmac and passengers pointing out the windows to their bags. The staff were downright rude and refused to even provide a drink.,1
"Kota Bharu to Kota Kinabalu return. Ontime departure & arrival (10-20 minutes earlier arrival for both journey). Reasonable crew, tasty food. Wished that AirAsia will increase the frequency direct flight to 4x week at least. Will fly with them again.",0
Singapore to Jakarta. Nothing good to say. Aircraft is outdated and dirty. Seat pitch is extremely tight. Cabin crew is not friendly. Delayed by 1.5 hours.  Overall it is extremely bad and have bad time management. Would not recommend Lion Air.,1
Bengaluru to Mumbai by IndiGo Airlines. The check-in was quite comfortable. We were welcomed warmly by the cabin crew while boarding the aircraft. The aircraft seemed clean as compared to other airlines in India. The lavatories were also well maintained without any faul smell. The seats had a very soft cushioning hence it made quite a comfortable journey for us and were also wide. Though we had to buy food but it did not create any issues. Their food tasted fantastic. The flight departed and arrived on time. The landing and takeoff were very smooth. I recommend this airline and always a pleasure.,0
Arrive with my hand luggage. They ask me to put my handbag on the scales as well then charge me $65 because I am over the weight. This is the kind of unfair service that puts people off these budget airlines,1
"I decided to switch from Jetstar to Scoot, thought it would be better as it's with SQ. Nope. They changed my flight, didn't give another option. Been trying to contact them, no easy way...or any way. Stay away.",1
Legazpi (DRP) to Sydney via Manila. Before purchasing ticket I know my expectations about Cebu Pacific being a LCC. DRP to MNL flight was on-time while MNL to SYD was slightly delayed which is normal for flights out of MNL. Pre-ordered meal was ok as well as the on-board service. Now what I like the most was the price I paid which was a steal. I will keep using Cebu Pacific both local and international as a cheaper alternative.,0
Jetstar are in the habit of cancelling flights with little notification time (45mins before flight time via an email) and then abandoning passengers after transferring them to closed airports. Ground staff less than helpful and claimed that this type of service is to be expected from budget carriers. They appear to be over-anticipating passenger demand on some routes and when supply outstrips demand simply cancelling flights and disrupting passengers by either flying them the next day or transferring them to flights to other airports on sister airlines and bussing passengers to their original destination. Totally unacceptable when travelling with children and being left outside a locked airport terminal after an hour long bus transfer at 1.00am.,1
"Seated in 5C, in a supposedly quieter part of the plane. The flight left late, and lost time, arriving an hour late in Berlin. I found the flight uncomfortable. I didn't sleep a wink. There are no frills on Scoot, even the usb port was charged for. The carpet was filthy and worn. I've been on other Scoot 787s, this one (reg 9VOFH) was really showing its age. I've flown Scoot 4 times, and I like the fares, but the level of discomfort was too much. I paid an extra SGD $50 for the quiet seat and it was a waste of money. It has made me reconsider taking budget airlines long distance. Singapore to Melbourne with Scoot, I can deal with that, but Singapore to Europe, I don't think so.",1
"My wife and booked to fly to Bali for a relaxing holiday June 7th and returning June 16th with Jetstar. We checked in with Jetstar staff flew to Bali only to be told that we would be sent straight back home as the wife's passport was 2 weeks short of the mandatory 6 months required. Bali airport questioned why this was not picked up by Jetstar staff at the check-in counter. We rang the Australian Embassy who said that we should never been allowed to allowed to leave Australia. When flown back to Australia via Sydney where Jetstar Staff stated that this was their fault we should have picked this up at check-in. Pathetic,  useless staff in Brisbane. Do not fly Jetstar. if you have a problem don't bother calling, you will only get a machine. all they want is your money.",1
"Extremely dissatisfied with the Customer Service Relations team. Due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstance, my flight from Mumbai to London Heathrow was cancelled and hence I wanted to cancel my flight from Tuticorin to Mumbai. I had requested via email to honour and waive the cancellation charges but to no avail. It would have been a gesture of goodwill to waive the charges at least a certain amount and not half the ticket price.",1
"Delay for 4 hours yet when I about to board the plane, they announced another delay. No estimation time. Bad, bad, bad. Don't they have extra aircraft since they are in hometown? What JetStar's CEO said is rubbish. Never fly with them again.",1
"Flew with AirAsia from Chennai (Madras) to Kuala Lumpur. Quite a full flight. I'd checked in online and it was a breeze through the baggage drop as most passengers seemed to have decided to check in old skool style. Plane was loaded efficiently and departed on time. With a favourable tail wind and lack of air traffic, we arrived in KUL half an hour early. Unfortunately there was a plane in our parking slot which hadn't departed yet, so lost 15 mins. The seat on the plane was pretty standard Air Asia legroom and recline -  not a great deal. But given the attractive price of my ticket, I'd say it was pretty good value for money. Couldn't really comment on the inflight service as I was asleep for the most part or playing games on my phone. As we seem to have been the first flight of the day arriving, some of the entry doors in the KLIA2 terminal were not opened, further eroding the gains from the early arrival. Quick through immigration and a long wait for baggage to be unloaded - this took about an hour. Also, quick through Customs checks. All in all, a great value product for a short flight where luxuries are not required.",0
"One of our passengers wanted to upgrade to the Emergency Upgrade Seats. For two days before the actual travel date we could neither reach the AirAsia listed telephone no, nor could we re-login. After boarding the flight we saw a vacant seat and offered to pay but we were not allowed. Same thing happened on the way back from Bali. Neither the online check-in works nor the telephone no. Customer Service is non-existent. There is no AirAsia counter in KL Airport for the service of en route passengers. Even water is not served, which is being too stingy. The A320s flying to India are too cramped. On the way back from Bali to KL, we were unfortunate to get the last row seats. besides the constant sound of the toilet flush, the Cabin Crew, who did not have much work, were chatting away at the top of their voices like excited school children. Flights were late by minimum 1 hour on all four legs. Overall one of the lousiest flights that we have travelled. No professionalism at all.",1
"Berlin to Denpasar via Singapore. First of all, they do not offer water on a 13.5 hour flight. If that's not illegal, it should be. They lost my bag for a week and offered me ZERO help to get it back - I eventually got it back through my own efforts by making dozens of expensive calls every day for a week to the ground staff at the relevant airports. It was extremely stressful. Every time I asked for help from Scoot, if I actually got through which was rare, the person on the end of the phone said it was not their role to help with that and could not even direct me towards someone who could. I filed a claim for compensation for the expenses incurred in the week without my luggage (not to mention the stress of it!) and two months have gone by and they are still ignoring my emails. I'm absolutely appalled by how little care they have for rectifying a mistake they have made. A joke of an airline. Not worth the risk of flying with them. AVOID!!!",1
Flew Melbourne to Bali in business class old plane before they introduce the new planes on the route. Food and drinks were excellent and better than the Qantas domestic offering however please don't scrimp on a proper desert. The current inflight entertainment was limited and I put it away once I looked at the content hopefully new planes have something better. Service was great from the Aussie and Thai crew.,0
"CGK-KUL flight was delayed by 45 min due to some runway repairs that we could see from the window. Flight arrived only slightly late. KUL-MAA flight landed 20 min ahead of time. Although I was flying on cheap tickets I could buy exit row aisle seats for both flights. The middle seat remained vacant in both flights probably because no one wants to pay for the pleasure of sitting in the middle seat! In both flights the meal that I had preordered turned out to be pretty tasty. This is what I like about this airline - at the time of booking you can buy the degree of comfort that you want, verify it and then pay for it. Many other airlines would not allow cheap ticket holders to select premium seats. After flying full service airlines on business for decades I have recently switched to AirAsia in part due to the simplicity of the whole process - booking, seat and meal selection, checkin and boarding. The entire meal service is over quickly and they leave you in peace for the rest of the flight. If you need any snack or drink you could walk to the galley and buy it. Also for destinations in the South, SE Asia region they seem to offer the fastest connections.",0
"Worst customer service. Rude, unprofessional and unpleasant. Combative and unreasonable. Does not offer concrete solutions. Lures you to pay more. Worst flight experience",1
Out of 7 flights with 7 different companies they were the only ones weighing my carry on and even having a 23kg bag included they charged me $65 for it. It was the first and definitely the last time I fly with Jetstar. Its disgusting the way they rip people off.,1
Awful right from the get go. Very poor legroom little recline on seats. No entertainment. Very bad service from inflight staff. This is easily the worst airline I've been on. You get what you pay for. Budget price = budget everything.,1
"Sydney to Auckland. Jetstar lost our car seat and refused to accept any responsibility. Agent at Sydney airport had horrible customer service and we have yet heard back a response from Jetstar after we filed a complaint. On Aug 25, 2018, we were checking in for our flight JQ201 from Sydney to Auckland when we encountered likely the worse customer service of all of my 20 years of traveling experiences. There was a long waiting line to check in at the counter that morning. First question the agent asked of us was ""which one of you can speak English?"". I thought that was rude. We are Asians in appearance but both my husband and I are physicians from the USA.  As she was printing our boarding passes and luggage tags, she said she could see that we paid for two checked-in bags but she could not locate which passengers they were paid under, therefore she still had to charge us for the two checked in bags. I said I had the receipt for the paid checked-in bags. She looked through the computer again and said she still had to charged me for the two checked in bags. I could not believe it! It does not make any sense. I said I was not going to pay again because she could not find it. It is a form of incompetence. She then said ""I am not going to serve you anymore. You have to go to someone else."" and left me there standing. She did not tell me where to go initially. She was clearly doing that to delay my check-in process as a punishment and aggravates my anxiety as the flight departure time was approaching. I then requested to speak to her supervisor. Her supervisor was better but obviously not well trained for customer service (did not display ability to de-escalate the situation). But she figured out the problem was the car seat. Apparently the agent does not know that. She needs to be trained better but that is the least of her problem. Jetstar lost our car seat on the same flight which we learned about we got to Auckland. No one contacted about our car seat for a few days until we got back to San Francisco, USA. We had to buy a new car seat as a result. We contacted them for reimbursement but they refused.",1
On the 12 August we eventually flew Auckland to Singapore. The flight was meant to leave at 10.15am. So we arrived at the airport and checked in - nothing said about any delays just that a gate hadn't been assigned and to check the board. Went through customs told the flight information on our boarding passes was wrong - incorrect flight number! The board had a gate but no time! We went to the gate and found other people some of whom had received text messages saying that the flight was delayed until 14.45 or 4.45. After what would have been boarding time some Jetstar staff eventually appeared. First we were greeted with - didn't you hear the announcement! Then we were given - reluctantly - $10 vouchers to keep us fed and watered for the next 5.5 hours. Had we been told this at check-in we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. Jetstar don't allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. When we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldn't be delayed! Then they delayed us as they tried to find 15 missing people - probably the ones who had been told 4.45 instead of 14.45. Never again.,1
"Wellington to Dunedin. I've taken a few flights with Jetstar and aftet today I feel it's time to write a review. If you're looking for a reliable airliner, Jetstar is not it. Every single flight with Jetstar this far has either been delayed heavily or cancelled. I've lost hundreds of dollars in accomodation and rental bookings which I'm told won't be refunded. Don't tell me it's bad weather, the weather is clear, what about the sophisticated instruments you have on board? The last time I fly with Jetstar. Just wasted half of my Sunday and then to be told it's cancelled. Staff are confused and uninformed as well. When compared to other airlines I've never had problems.",1
"Newcastle to Melbourne. I regularly fly this route usually with virgin. I often see this Jetstar flight delayed. This time I chose Jetstar. What a mistake, I was the victim of a 2.15 hr delay because the system was down.  Will never fly this flight again.  No wonder Jetstar gets the ratings it does.",1
"Singapore to Melbourne. The price was great, the aircraft new and the service efficient. Thats about as good as it gets. At 196cm tall the seat doesn't really fit me,  and the seat has a design flaw where the light and call assistance button is on the arm rest. Everyone hits it constantly.  Price of food was bearable but the choices weren't really tempting. I chose the most western item and it was passable but I have had better meals on Jetstar and AirAsia. I think they need to look at the Jetstar 787 and they can make some improvements. Wifi internet workable but a bit pricey.",0
"Singapore to Surabaya. I am a frequent Jetstar customer and satisfied with the service till I had a disappointing experience today with the service attendant. The location of check in in changi airport has just changed and I was clueless. After checking in at the e-kiosk, I queue for back drop and there is one counter for back drop and document check. I queue from the left and the person said, ""what are you here for?"" I answered for back drop. She said, ""next time queue on the left, not on the right!"" with a rude tone. I feel dissatisfied with the way she speak as she need to understand that the location have just changed and customer making mistakes are expected. She need improve on communication skills for Jetstar to keep the regular customers happy.",1
"My first and last flight with Jetstar JQ30. After security at Bangkok I purchased water in departures just before boarding, but was taken off me when boarding as I was told water was not allowed on this flight. I was assured plenty would be available in flight. After take off I requested water to and was presented with a tiny bottle of water and asked for four dollars. I purchased six of these during the flight. In all my years of flying i have never experienced this. I have flown Ryanair around Europe and have no qualms with a budget flight on short haul of a few hours but never imagined this scenario on a 9 hour long haul. I will not fly Jetstar again. Perhaps my fault for not checking out Jetstar before booking.",1
Very bad logistics and management. Very bad in providing information. We arrived at Manila domestic flight terminal 4 with 2 hours in advance only to board the flight 15 minutes before departure in a congested airport with not enough seats. The gate was called past what was supposed to be the boarding time. We then waited almost one hour on the airplane with no A/C (thus with very high temperatures) with no information whatsoever provided on why we were not departing and when this would happen. Overall bad experience and waste of time. Overpriced ticket and bad customer service from Cebu Pacific.,1
"I don't often fly with LCC, but given the good flight schedule and attractive price (even at premium flex, both way), I thought to give that a go. I was very pleasantly surprised how smooth things were. From check in to boarding, and through to KL. It was a nice touch that premium flex passengers were entitled a 30kg, a free meal, frontal hot seats, exclusive check in counter and priority luggage. I found out sourced ground staffs in HKG courteous, boarding was orderly, where priority for premium flex passengers were strictly observed. Seat pitch of hot seats were quite ok, just like any regular economy class of any airlines. Cabin crew are energetic and do their job well. Pre-ordered meal was actually quite tasty, mine was a kung-pao chicken with a free water. The duty free item I ordered was delivered to me with a smile. Plane took off and landed on time. KLIA2 is a good terminal with many shops and eateries. I am very satisfied with the whole experience.",0
"Auckland to Palmerston North. Was in a hurry so checked in online, didn't print out my boarding pass 'cause I didn't even have time (my bad). Was hoping the boarding pass with a bar code on my phone would be ok, lady at boarding gate didn't seem to have a problem with that at all so she checked me in as normal. They ended up checking the wrong person in and gave it to me as me and the other one had the same surname and first name's initial. Obviously this resulted 2 people with the same seating, tried to explain to staff what I thought happened, apologized for the confusion because I felt at fault. The guilty feeling stopped when this lady was rude and blamed the whole thing on me for holding the wrong boarding pass. Well, I'm sorry that your staff was the one who checked the wrong person in, instead of using the booking reference to ensure they checked in the right person, they used the last name (which can be very common). It was amazing how I received no apologies for the mistakes on their end and had to feel bad for my mistakes only. I only thought it was ok to use a boarding pass on phone because I never had an issue with using it in the past with Jetstar. The flight attendant was sweet enough to check if I was ok afterward but then said ""it's alright"" like ""yeah, we forgave you""??? This time it's not the delays that bother me (you get what you pay for), it's the attitude of staff.",1
"JT683 Lion Air morning flight from Surabaya to Palangkarya. Departed on time. The flight was not full, so all passengers were in the plane 15 minutes before departure. Take-off was smooth and the flight landed in Palangkaraya exactly at 7.50 am but landing was rough.",0
"Perth to Cairns. It is a classic low cost airlines, not much legroom, it was a 4 hour flight, not a very comfortable one, except that airfare was reasonable. It was a red eye flight. I would recommend the airline only when fare is considerable less than Qantas or Virgin Australia.",0
"AirAsia needs to step up its game! Flying from Penang to Kuala Lumpur so many times and most of the time the flight is always delayed by an hour plus. Same thing happened again this time, another delay by an hour plus. This is a joke, I have other flight to catch and life to live. The ticket price gets more expensive but service is non-existent. You are being hauled and hushed quickly by the staff and the prided best customer service is a joke. Not consistent and hard to get. Overprice F&B, seat selection and old entertainment and uncomfortable seating arrangement. I will go with a full service carrier in the future!",1
CNX-KUL. Arrived at airport about 30 minutes before scheduled departure time only to find that checkin stops 45 minutes before and the automatic check in machine was programmed not to check me in as I was deemed late. I checked in at the desk without any problem without checked bags. Plane was late inbound but we made up the time on the flight south. Standard AirAsia service with reasonable cabin crew. Not their latest aircraft but interior in good condition. I was lucky to be off the aircraft quickly as the skies opened and there was a short sharp downpour and anyone from the rear of the plane would have been a drowned rat as there is no jetway from AirAsia flights.,0
Last week I flew from BOM to Goa and return. Both flights were slightly delayed (ca 15 mins) but the quality of the service has compensated for these minor delays. The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals. In general comparing to European 'no frills' airlines IndiGo presents generally a better offering and service.,0
"Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh via Singapore. Check in at Melbourne our luggage was weighed including my laptop and found to be over the 7 kg about 1.8kg My spouse had her luggage weighed together with her bag and found to exceed the 7 kg allowed by 1.1 kg. According to airline rules we had to pay extra for this. However, the attitude of the 2 female staff at the kiosk was quite insulting. My spouse asked how much will be the charge each for the whole trip, charge was A$91.82 per person for 15 kg each, which we paid. My wife particularly asked if this charge and weight was for each and for the whole trip and the answer was in the affirmative. On departure from SG to Vietnam we were told my spouse had to pay extra because it was JetStar Asia, not Jetstar Intl and they said Jetstar Asia had nothing to do with Jetstar Intl. Luckily my spouse had now only 6.6 kg luggage and she opted to take the luggage to cabin. I paid for 15 kg $91.82, my spouse paid for 15 kg 91.82 (we have receipts).  As said pay cheap get nasty surprises. Never again Jetstar.",1
Was on service from AKL to CHC with Jetstar. The flight was on time check-in was smooth (SMS boarding pass was a smart choice). Attendants were nice helpful though the flight was literally full. Cannot review the food and entertainment in details as they were not included in the price. For a budget airline it was quite good and enjoyable for me.,0
"Manila to Cebu. This is the worst airline ever. The ground staff are not friendly, the flight attendance are no exception either. On top of it, their customer service/care the worst I ever experienced. I will not recommend this airline to anyone I know. Cheap airline with cheap services fit them perfectly.",1
Singapore to Amritsar. The services are very poor. Everything is paid and quality is very poor. They don't even provide free water to their customers. The behavior of the crew towards the customer was also bad.,1
ZIPAIR completely broke my brand new luggage and refused to reimburse for damages. I filed an incident report at the baggage counter and I heard back 3 months later that the luggage (cracked and broken halfway through with multiple holes) was considered a 'scratch' and it 'happens'. I ironically bought the luggage the night before my flight so I wasted $400+ on its first flight with ZIPAIR. Wifi doesnt work and theres no TV to watch movies for the long flight. Cabin crew and food were the only decent experience for ZIPAIR.,1
"Tokyo to Sydney via Taipei / Singapore. Food and drink service almost non-existent. Food pathetic, especially for business class. No inflight entertainment, not even a screen on the back of the seat in front. Some passengers able to connect to a plug in the armrest and watch a movie on their mobile phone. Very unsatisfactory. No business class lounge at Tokyo or Taipei. First and last Scoot flight.",1
They closed gates 30 mins prior to departure without any notification and staff is so rude and misbehaving. They leave us on airport and take extra charges for next flight.,1
Flew Scoot Sydney to Singapore 2pm flight. Checked in at 12 and told flight was delayed 2 hours. Boards showed flight boarding so went to boarding gate only to be told flight was delayed again - no one knew why. 2 hours later we got to board. Sat on the plane for almost an hour before we took off. My first son flew two weeks later - his flight was delayed by an hour - boarding was chaotic whilst every friend and his brother tried to rush onto the plane irrespective of a zone call. My daughter in law flew in last week Friday. Arrival time was 7pm. Looking online we saw the flight was delayed by 2 hours. We arrived at the airport at 9pm - flight board showed arrival as 9.15pm. At 9.30pm arrival time was changed to 10.22pm! Delayed 3.5 hours! Hugely unimpressed with Scoot.,1
"Manila to Sydney. You get exactly what you pay for. A horrible Check in experience, the flight was full so about 400+ people wanting to check in at the same time, however I only had hand luggage and had to queue with everyone regardless of checking in online and only having cabin baggage which is a painfully awful service to receive. Cebu Pacific has one class which is economy so the aircraft is like a bus with a 3x3x3 seat configuration, thinning at the back of the aircraft to 2x3x2 - the seats were very uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight! The cabin staff are distinctly average, with a really dated uniform and no IFE (which was expected). Overall I would use this airline again purely as the flight was ridiculously cheap in a sale. However this airline could learn a lot from their long haul competitors AirAsia X.",0
Do not fly with them. They cancelled my flight and I've spent days trying to get a refund or credit. They do anything not to talk to you and put you through hoops of never getting in contact with them. Only way is to drive out to the airport 3 times and still they just send an email shutting the case with no explanation. They cancelled the flight to keep tourists trapped in Bali during Covid and still won't give a refund.,1
I am very disappointed with  Jetstar. I am requesting a refund for the canceled Brisbane to Melbourne flight ($ 610) the day after I booked it. Jetstar offers me only a voucher that I cannot use. I am returning to my country on Thursday and have no other flights available before this day. They don't want to hear anything. Jestar is taking advantage of these times of crisis to rip off people.  Shame on you.,1
"Worst company ever, avoid at all costs. Loaded a full plane with passengers on a delayed schedule. Machine and air conditioning were not functioning. Temperatures were beyond belief. Kept everyone on the plane in those conditions for 30 minutes with no respect for wellbeing of passengers. Crew acted like they knew nothing. Captain made no announcement. Proceeded to offload everyone and then provided no info for 30 minutes. Plane had technical issues and was unable to depart. Passengers were made to wait for a new plane.",1
Just today my family took an A321 flight from Melbourne to Hobart. My family moved to our seats and when we sat down we could see food scraps on our seats and on the floor. The plane left at 4pm one hour late and looking like a pigsty. The Captain apologised for the delay and promised free refreshments we then were offered a cup of water.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Thiruchillapali. This is the first time I have experienced bad service by air Asia, and it happened in their KL terminal 2.  My wife booked a ticket for me to go to India via KL, but she booked it under my nick name because domestically in the Philippines I travel under that name. The ticket we bought however does allow passenger name change, but there is a fine print which is a total con. The chat service and customer support just kept throwing us back and forth and finally when we pushed they promised that it will be refunded we just have to buy another ticket for the moment. Well this happened December 2016. Till now no answer, just a template answer saying no refund because the name is different. To me, I don't care about the money it's a small issue. I still fly air Asia when there is no other airline available for the price and time, but if there is a better airline, I take that instead.",1
"1/28/2020 we flew from Melbourne to Sydney JQ526. The flight was late about one hour. We told the counter rep at Melbourne that we needed to catch next flight JQ3 and didnt have enough time to transfer due to the delay. We asked them to transfer our luggages directly to our next flight because our next flight is also Jetstar. They told us they couldnt do that. When we got Sydney airport and rushed to Jetstar counter. They charged us $140 for two luggages. We have traveled so many international flights and always have one free checked bag. We were already late due to your delay and took about 20 minutes to check in and pay luggage fee. Fortunately we did catch our next flight from Sydney to Honolulu. When we arrived Honolulu, we found our two luggages missing. We spent one hour to file the paperwork. On 1/31/2020, we got a call from Portland, Oregon International Airport (PDX) Alaska Airline counter on 1/31/2020. They told us that our bags arrived at PDX and asked us to contact Jetstar and make arrangement to pick up (because Jetstar doesn't have any contract with Alaska Airline to deliver missing bags to customers). We discussed options with Jetstar luggage reps several times and spent over three hours on the phone. Finally, they gave us three options: 1. We can go to PDX and pick up the baggage ourselves. 2. Ask Alaska Airline to make arrangement to deliver the baggage. Alaska told us they could not do so since they don't have contract with Jetstar. 3. Arrange a third-party courier to pick up. Jetstar will reimburse cost with any of above options. After we considered the above three options, we decided to pick up the baggage on our own. We live 70 miles from PDX and it takes us about 1.5 hours one way to PDX. We left home at 5:30pm after work and came back at 9:00pm. We spent three hours on the road and half hour at PDX. We have been working the reimbursement with Jetstar since 2/1/2020. They asked us to complete the statutory declaration. We did. After all time we spent, they are only willing to reimburse us mileage cost and no drive time reimbursement. They dont follow through their commitment. This is our whole experience with Jetstar.",1
"Flew back from Amritsar to Singapore on 19th September. Scoot system was down at the airport and they said they had no proof to verify if we had prebooked luggage. We have stopped printing our tickets and our phone was dead. Check In staff then said to pay for the 30 kilos as excess luggage and claim refund in Singapore which did not make sense. As system was down, we waited 2 hours in the line while they manually wrote boarding passes. When we finally boarded, my sister felt sick and wanted to use to toilet. The staff said she was not allowed to as they were doing a physical headcount. I then asked them if I could purchase water for my sister and they said they will not begin selling till the plane took off.  I wrote to Scoot and all I got was the usual ""Apologise for the inconvenience caused"" answer with no reason why passengers were treated so inhumanely.",1
"Our Flight to Phuket was cancelled 3.5 hours before the departure time. Jetstar then took 2 days to get us to our destination via Singapore (we only booked with Jetstar because it was direct). Things didn't get much better when we got on a flight we were delayed on another flight and neither gate staff or cabin crew gave us any information or an apology. We lost two days accommodation in Phuket and Jetstar refused to compensate us for any of our out of pocket expenses. After spending an hour on the phone talking to Customer Support (mainly being put on hold) they told us to chat online to a support agent, also a waste of time. We had water taken off us before boarding the aircraft then cabin crew sold small bottles of water for $4. The whole experience was terrible.and Jetstar lived up to it reputation as the World worst airline in 2017.",1
PEN-SIN. Short flight from Penang to Singapore. A320 aircraft looked fairly new in good clean condition. Buy on board service was efficient and well priced. Arrived on time. No issues would defiantly fly with the again especially for the bargain prices that they offer.,0
"Hong Kong to Phuket. I booked the premium flex ticket to get good leg room. I was advised that this type of ticket allowed me to change my flight date at an extra charge.  I needed to change my flight date more than a month before flight date. I tried for days to access my booking on Airasia homepage and when the page finally allowed me to login (I had correct login credentials, the page just didnt work for days) it said I had no booking. Finally I had to call their customer service to have the flight changed instead. At customer support I explained that I needed to change my flight and was told that I had to sit on a standard seat. I asked if it could be solved. They didnt even try to have it sold but just said no. I end up with normal seat instead. I then asked for a refund since I was no longer getting what I paid for. Instead I was asked to pay 1500HKD extra for the change of the flight. I had known about this rule before, but I still asked for compensation due to not getting what I paid for. Also I later found out that if I had booked a new ticket instead of using my return ticket the cost of the new ticket would have been 1700HKD. That is 200HKD more than the fee I had to pay for changing my return ticket, but still several hundred HKD less than what I paid in upgrade for the premium flex ticket I had originally purchased.",1
TZ2-TZ1 (SYD-SIN). My previous experience with their 777s were not so great especially the seats which were as hard as rock. However they have changed to the new 787 Dreamliner since then and I had a much better experience this time. Food was below average the portion still wasn't able to fill my hungry stomach. However the seats on the 787 had much better cushion and more legroom. I realized that you don't need an IFE if you are willing to pay US$30 to surf the Internet for the entire trip and a bit extra for power if you are running out of battery (though I didn't see anyone paying that in economy). The only reason IFE still exists is when you don't have access to Internet or your phone. If you don't really care about travel prestige not having hot towels and complimentary toiletries is fine willing to eat before you board and is trendy enough to substitute IFE for Internet access then you can get a really good deal out of this airline which consistently offers half the ticket price of legacy airlines over long-haul routes.,0
"Terrible customer service. AirAsia cancelled my flight at 16 hours notice and offered a replacement on a different day. This obviously meant I had to rebook on a different airline at short notice to get a ticket on the correct day, which cost me a lot of money. Getting a refund is impossible because there is no one to speak to who will offer to help on this issue, even though it seems to be quite common. I keep getting told to send a Tweet or go to an online chat forum which simply never works.",1
Christchurch to Melbourne. I bought 40 kg per person of luggage only to get to the airport and be told we do not honor your ticket. If you dont pay you can't get on this plane. So had to pay $575 so we could get on the plane. After 10 minutes we were called back to the counter and told we made a mistake but we will keep your money for 15 working days. As they took the money just before Christmas i wont get the money until end of January and that stinks. Never will i fly Jetstar again never been treated so bade. The worst service ever.,1
"Jetstar Airways service was amazing. Once I saw the cabin I knew this would be a good one. The seat was comfortable and the leg space was good enough. The food is excellent and the cabin service was great. However the airline should include in-flight entertainment to improve their status. Overall, it is a good airline.",0
"Brisbane to Sydney on December 10. Great service, value for money. Flight was on time, craft was new and clean, service was efficient and professional. Meal was better than expected. A pleasant change when comparing to another low cost airline I was using during my stay in Australia. Next time, I would choose Jetstar for my national flights in Australia.",0
MEL-DPS Business class A330-200. Overall excellent flight - great value for money I purchased ticket on sale. Cabin crew friendly and helpful - IPads and meals served very quickly. You get what you pay for with the seat - it's no flat bed but nevertheless I found it very comfortable and even managed to get some sleep. I would fly Jetstar again.,0
"Received a message 2 hours prior to departure that flight will be delayed by 40 min. Just at the moment boarding started, it was announced that the gate has changed. After another her 1h of wait in a cramped non ac waiting area, boarding finally started. Another 30 min wait, the plane finally took off with a 2h 10 min delay. The explanation was heavy air traffic over Kuala Lumpur, which wasnt true, since other flight were not delayed. Flight itself uneventful",1
"Having flown Business Class on International routes with other airlines, we thought that Scoot Biz may be good value for money. Bear in mind we assumed Biz was short for Business. Instead of Business Class it was Business Farce. We had to pay extra to use the lounge and were told at the check-in desk to go to Singapore Airlines Business lounge - not so! Singapore Airlines wouldn't even admit Scoot Biz passengers, but instead referred us to another lower market lounge. The seats only reclined 8 inches and the leg support did nothing. I asked for 2 pillows to support my back and was told I had to pay for them. That was when the staff told me that it was not Business Class but Premium Economy. The meal supplied was the same as you get on any Economy Class flight with other airlines. Only one drink supplied for the 7 hour flight.  The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" rings true with Scoot Airlines.",1
KUL-CGK-KUL. Excellent flight. The trip was smooth. As I am tall I always like to ask for the aisle seat or the emergency seats. I always get my request. 3 times/day schedules which suits me fine. The airline leaves from KLIA proper not from the low cost terminal in Malaysia.,0
"Jetstar delayed our flight by 4+ hours both ways. This happened, on each occasion, in 3-4 30 minute increments (constantly pushing back our flight so we couldnt choose to spend our time on other things while we waited). On each instance of delay they failed to communicate that they were delaying our flight. Often they would wait until 15 minutes after the plane was supposed to take off, Leaving us sitting in the departure terminal not knowing what to do. These corrupts idiots had the nerve to tell everyone, in well publicised media releases, to turn up 45 minutes earlier for their flights to improve reliability and punctuality, transferring the blame to customers. Now they make us wait 4 hours repeatedly, forcing us to wait hours in airports, missing connecting flights, missing plans weve made on the other end, costing no end of inconvenience. And they decide were the ones to blame. Id happily pay 200 per cent more to fly with anyone other than jetstar. They are deliberately under staffing to save costs, failing to admit their faults, and disingenuously suggesting its customers that cause their reputation for unreliability. Insane. Dont buy it, pay more and get more of your holiday back.",1
PER-SIN. Left on time cabin staff actually very good. This trip was better than some full service airlines. Problem in seat 15 - no overhead bin available due to Emergency oxygen and cabin stores and way the divider is set up also blanks out two other bins. Food was able to be eaten (just) and not worth the cost. Scoot should be taken to task as no android service of any kind. The 777's have a better feel up the front than say A320. Seat comfortable wide and lots of leg room in Biz. Excellent cabin staff. Cabin heat was rather hot announcements very hard to hear and garbled. Rest of the deal not worth the hassle.,1
PER-SIN-PER. The website was difficult to access and understand let alone come to grips with what was on offer. A bad decision was to opt for payment of excess baggage (over 15kg) at the airport which cost $264. Boarding was chaotic the plane eventually departing 35 minutes late. My wife ordered a meal that would not be fit for a dog's consumption mine being a concoction which was barely edible. Onboard in the equivalent of premium economy the seats were sufficiently comfortable for a 5 hour flight but no more. There would appear to be very little the cabin crew knew of basics that is so superbly demonstrated by its parent company. While in Singapore I tried to pay for baggage through the website and only with the assistance of a family member was this achieved after 3 days of trying. The return flight was about 40% capacity and the service was still below average. Duty free shopping was not on a trolley but was available at the rear galley of the plane (no announcement to this effect). I did like the list of passenger seat numbers showing who had ordered food on line - a scrappy piece of cardboard stuck to one of the cupboards. Sure it's a budget airline but all the basics are missing.,1
"Will avoid this airline. Beware of ridiculous checked baggage fees. We tried paying lesser fees online when we were checking in, but the AirAsia website conveniently skipped our baggage options no matter which option we tried to select. Then, at the check in counter, we had to pay $144 for 2 small bags (10 kilos each), even though we tried and tried paying that online ahead of time. When I told the clerk that I couldn't pay online, because I was told that this was my problem and I should have called the customer service. Don't pay for ""hot seats"" - that's another rip off. You get no extra legroom, but you do get extra 15 minutes in a stuffy cabin waiting for everyone else to board, because ""hot seats"" board first. If you want any food - prepay when you are checking in. Otherwise, you won't even get a glass of water out of them. Value for money - not so good. We paid $550 for 2 seats from Siem Reap to Phuket and then an extra $144 for the luggage, so this is not a low coster. Yet, their policies are those of a low coster: pay for printing boarding pass, pay for luggage, etc.",1
Medan to Padang. Flight attendants very polite I was able to choose a seat with online check-in however their fleet is quite old (737-400). Flight from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur (737-900 new fleet) you can not do online check-in for an international flight so I arrived at the airport early. Service and landing at KLIA was good.,0
"5 hours delay due to ""unknown engineering problem"" no notification in advance and during the whole 5 hours Scoot representatives repeat helplessly we do not know when and if the flight will resume we'll notify you when we know. No vouchers or any compensation was offered. Terrible service even for a budget flight. It was first and last time for me to travel with budget airline.",1
"Singapore to Taipei with Scoot on the SIN-TPE-NRT route. The legroom was not bad for a someone 5'5 and the recline was nice. Aircraft was spacious. Announcements were made in English, Chinese and Japanese. The flight was better the expected. I will fly again.",0
Star Class SYD-HNL-SYD 11/6/2012 return 21/06/2102. Check in easy crew fantastic. I'm 6ft 4in plenty of legroom better than Qantas 747 Premium Economy. Enjoyed Qantas club both in Sydney and Honolulu food was good.,0
"Hong Kong to Melbourne via Singapore. I have flown on many airlines and scoot by far has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had traveling in my entire life by all measures. Every experience with them has been frustrating and ridiculous. I have never encountered more unhelpful and incompetent people in my whole life than those who work at scoots call centers and airport transfer desks.  I tried to check my bag in online but the website links did not work, the app did not work, and it took 30 mins to get through to call center. The representative put me on hold after every question because it was clear he did not know how to answer basic questions. Finally, he informed me bag would have cost 400 Singapore dollars if I had checked it in at the airport counter! And this is insane considering how extremely difficult it was for me to check it in ahead of time with none of their websites or apps working properly.  I was wondering if they intentionally cause their website and app to not work properly so that customers who need to check a bag get trapped at the airport with a fee twice as much as the actual flight. I also tried to check in through Scoots app 3 hours before flight. To my panic, the app said that my flight had already departed which was entirely not true since it was 3 whole hours early! A kind of glitch like this is unacceptable on every level because of the panic that it would cause!!  The first of my two connecting flights were delayed 6 hours for mechanical issues and they did not even bother to notify me ahead of time. No email, no update on the app. The app said everything was on time! No one knew this under we got to the airport 6 hours early and had no options. Even when I had spoken to Scoots call agent to check my bag earlier, they did not mention this. I luckily found out through my travel agent, and since I was going to miss my connection, I had to make a new flight plan. Scoot was so unhelpful and incompetent that I was mind-blown. I wasted my entire last day of my trip on the phone with them which they ruined entirely! For absolutely no reason at all, they refused to simply put me on a different connecting flight that worked out with the delay time and had available seats. They said that I would have to just fly to my connecting airport and just take a risk and see what is available. When I finally got to my connecting airport, no one on my flight had any idea at all where to go or what to do, and the Scoot agents at the transfer counters were clueless. They sent me to the entirely wrong counters and kept giving me conflicting info about my checked bag. I warn you against booking with them even if their prices are $100 cheaper than other airlines.",1
PER-MEL. The main reason being we were given $200 in vouchers for cancelled flight from earlier this year from Denpasar to Perth. Trying to book the tickets online the vouchers wouldn't work. Checked with online Jetstar staff who assured me vouchers were valid. After 8 more attempts gave up and booked on phone. In the end the overall cost went up by approx $185 thus cancelling out vouchers. Probably would not have travelled with them as they worked out to be not much cheaper than other airlines after the 'voucher' debacle. What can I say the staff do the best they can but all in all very badly run. The food is average with very small selection the seats are uncomfortable and not particularly clean. Be careful if you get 'vouchers' It lured us into flying with Jetstar when we probably wouldn't have otherwise.,1
"Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. he plane left the boarding gate 5 minutes behind schedule and took off 17 minutes later. Take off was smooth and the flight was fine all the way to KUL, except for a few minor bumps along the way.",0
"Twenty years in the film distribution business and never once has an airline refused to allow me to hand carry movie posters in a tube until my first flight with Zipair from NRT-SIN on Nov 4th 2022. They said my poster tube exceeded the dimensions of their overhead compartment. They insist that I paid for another 23kg of check-in luggage when my check-in luggage was 19.5kg of 23kg and my hand carry was only 4.5kg of 7kg. It was very clear that they did not want to listen to my explanation that my luggage was under weight and the poster tube weighed under 2kg. They kept saying that it is company policy. The flight was less than 20% occupied. A Very empty flight. The overhead compartment would have easily contained my poster tube with plenty of space to spare. Poster paper measures 27inch width and 39inch height rolled into a poster tube (cardboard) 2 inches longer than the poster's width.  The cabin crew were unsmiling patrolling the aisles like the police. I found them annoying as they made their presence felt, too much and gave out that I am watching you feeling. And it's not like they were giving out water. You have to pay for it. My pre-paid inflight meal was not bad. The expensive wagyu beef bowl is available and they seemed to have stopped selling their normal beef bowl.(minus points here) Purchased a can of Suntory Premium Beer and Pringles. Paid with a credit card but had to type in my details on their tablet. Prices were reasonable but I had to self-type all the cc details, etc for it to happen. Cash is not accepted for inflight sales. Otherwise, the flight was smooth., cabin was clean (hardly any pax) Less rigidity and friendly cabin crew may improve business. Keep your current attitude and Scoot will benefit most with their flexibility and surprisingly professional and charming cabin crew on my SIN-NRT flight on the same trip. Both flight tix were bought using the airline official website.",1
"Very good flight with Jetstar. Plane was a bit messy though. Food was great, really good cheap travel food on Jetstar. Cabin crew were great and very helpful. Jetstar is the best cheap travel airline by far. Way better then Tigerair or anything like that. At Gold Coast airport it was self check in and bag drop. Although there were a couple of Jetstar people walking around not really doing much. One again, very good flight with Jetstar, but as always, room for improvement!",0
"Surabaya to Singapore with Scoot. Speedy check-in with friendly ground-staff, speedy boarding. Bare-bones, not reclining seats and downright rude, unhelpful lead flight attendant ruined the overall experience.",0
A recent flight from Auckland to Queenstown with Jetstar was much better than expected. My husband and I were at the airport 2 hours before departure and there was no queue at the check-in desks so we didn't bother with the self-check-in kiosks and went straight to the counter. The check-in agent was all smiles checked in our bags handed us our boarding passes and wished us a pleasant journey. 30 minutes before departure we went though security where there were again no queues and the security agent could not have been more pleasant and even cracked a joke! The flight boarded on time with smiling flight attendants at the gate and at the aircraft door. The cabin of the A320 was clean bright and looked relatively new. We had paid a few extra dollars for extra leg room seats and had plenty of room in the exit row. The flight left on time and it didn't take long for the FAs to get the trolley out. We enjoyed a wine with cheese and biscuits for $10 whilst marvelling at the view below. Throughout the 1hr 45min flight the FAs were friendly down to earth and professional and instead of hiding after service were present throughout and happy to engage in conversation with passengers. We landed in Queenstown exactly on time our luggage was on the belt within 10 minutes and we were in a cab less than 5 minutes later. We were delightfully surprised!,0
We flew from KLIA2 to Bangkok Don Muang return at the end of October. I bought the tickets during a promo sale so paid very little. All went well. Flights were on time. It was a holiday weekend on the way out so the flight was full. Coming back things were less hectic as it was a normal weekday. I chose a lunch time flight so we could use a taxi to the airport easily. Check in was quick and the flight went on time. The pre-booked meals were all as expected. Seats were free up the back and we were allowed to use them and spread out. Arrival at KLIA2 was easy as we'd used the airport before. Air Asia offers a great product. You know what you'll get and so long as you buy during a promo period you'll pay very little.,0
I flew from KL to Miri and it was very pleasant. I was late and was the last passenger to board but Air Asia were very nice about it. Flight was smooth and arrived on time. Can't think of a single thing to criticise them except food could be better.,0
"I bought tickets from Caticlan to Shanghai via Manila. After some time, the airline changed the time of departure of both flights. The new departure time for me is not convenient and uncomfortable, so I wrote to the support service of Cebu Pacific with a request to fully refund the ticket for the reason of changing the schedule for the fault of the airline. In the return of money I was denied referring to the rules of the airline. However, if the airline changes the time of departure of its flights, the right to agree or disagree with the new departure time remains with the passenger. Thus, the airline's service is not customer-oriented at all.",1
I flew DMK (Don Muang) - SIN (Changi) many months ago. Very good Low-Cost Airline. Recommend for the Low-Cost Ticket.,0
"Gold Coast to Melbourne. I bought a flight that includes luggage but when I arrived at the airport they said my ticket didnt include luggage. The luggage I am carrying is within weight requirements in the US and EU, but here I had to pay an extra fee that cost more than I paid for the flight. The only positive aspect was the lady at the counter was very sweet and sympathetic. Nothing she could do, but she was nice about it. An airline should expect you to check luggage. I will never fly Jetstar again.",1
"I recently flew Cebu Pacific BKK-MNL red-eye flight which was fine (I paid for an exit seat). A few days later I flew MNL-PPS - being the day after the Manila floods the terminal was in complete chaos and the flight was 2 hours late but not bad in the circumstances and again the flight itself was fine. Cebu Pacific fares can look like a good deal but beware of their change fees. Due to the floods I needed to rearrange my travels and change my return flight from PPS. It would have cost me 1977PHP to change my CEB ticket - I chose instead to pay 1837PHP to buy a whole new ticket on Philippine Airlines. With PAL I was able to pay with my Australian Mastercard and avoid CEB's ""web admin fee"".",1
We recently flew Jetstar Auckland to Gold Coast and had not one issue with them. We left on time check in was quick and easy the flight staff were efficient and friendly and helpful. The seat was comfortable enough for a short flight and we landed early. To be honest it was one of the better flights I have been on. I was pleasantly surprised after reading other reviews. Will fly with them again.,0
"Sydney to Melbourne. I am appalled at how officious and rude so many of the staff we dealt with today were. My elderly parents were injured in an accident on the way to the airport. We missed our flight home and needed help to change the flights. We were told there was no guarantee, it was unlikely we would get a medical waiver and would have to pay for new flights. Despite both parents having head injuries not one of the five different staff we spoke to on the phone and at the counters offered us the advice that we should label our parents as needs assistance so that they could use a wheelchair. It was only when we saw one and asked if we could use it that one staff member finally clued us in to this provision! We needed assistance and everyone treated us like we were being a massive pain for them! We had to wait 8 hours for the next flight, making an already traumatic day just so much more exhausting and horrendous for us. I will never again fly with Jetstar: cheap fares just means no consideration. Thanks for nothing Jetstar!! Michelle",1
17/8/2014 JQ960 ADL-CNS and 24/8/2014 JQ963 CNS-ADL. Both flights were very pleasant. The cabin was very clean. Check in staff both friendly and polite in Adelaide and Cairns. Welcomed aboard both flights by friendly crew. Flight attendants were polite friendly and very helpful. Service was excellent. Seats were comfortable and food very nice. This is the only direct service to Cairns from Adelaide and Jetstar have nailed it. This is a low cost carrier but by far the best in Australia.,0
"Semarang to Kuala Lumpur. The flight departed from the new International airport in Semarang, which was great. Self-check in machines are available, which can cut down queue lines. Nevertheless, the line to queue to the plane was quite unmanageable.",0
"Pune to Nagpur with IndiGo. The plane was new, check in was smooth, boarding systematic, they are the only airline who use walkway to board the aircraft, this is better than using steps as PNQ airport does not use its airbridges for every flight. FA were smartly turned out and professional. The onboard trolley had snacks and beverages for purchase. The flights were punctual and comfortable.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi. One of the first flights of the day, we departed on time. I managed to get a more comfortable window seat and also bought a meal which was delicious. I also used the 10 GB free wifi allowance.",0
I booked Scoot for my sister and son SYD to SIN return. Whilst the outgoing flight was smooth and they were allowed to take their snacks on board on the return flight they were not even allowed to bring food/water onboard and being strict vegetarians it was tough as Scoot does not serve/sell anything that is purely vegetarian. The crew were rude and did not pay attention to anyone trying to call them. The tiny bottle of water sold on the plane - $4. A rip-off since they do not allow you to take water on board.,1
"Legazpi to Manila, August 2019 flight was on time. Perfect weather in LGP and a little bit of rain in MNL but didn't affect flight in any way. Bought my ticket less thank 1K Php so it was a steal. Ground & in flight service were good. I cannot find fault on this flight.",0
"Laoag to Manila with Cebu Pacific. Flight was late, so instead of a 6.05 pm departure the flight departed at 9.30 pm. This due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Laoag is a small airport with minimal facilities so the free McDonalds meal provided by ground staff was welcomed. ATR aircraft seemed brand new with a comfortable seat and clean cabin. Cabin crew were friendly but no catering offered on board. Couldn't work out if this was because we had been provided a meal at the airport or due to anticipated turbulence. No announcements from the flightdeck apart from requesting cabin crew to take their seats. Ramp disembarkment at Manila and quite a walk to the arrivals entrance in the rain. Each passenger was provided an umbrella upon leaving the aircraft which I thought was a good idea. Returned to staff at the arrivals building. All in all, although they need to improve their punctuality, it was a pleasant enough experience. Because I booked about a month in advance, the air fare was extremely good value and I would fly with them again.",0
"Me and my family bought tickets from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur together with 20kg baggage for all 3 of us. I paid the tickets and the 20kg for each of us and got the email confirmation. Just after i realise that 20kg won't be enough since we have 2 check in baggage for each of us, I  purchased another 25kg for each of us. In total I purchased 45kg for each of us. To my surprise at the airport when i did my check in, i was told that all 3 of us were overweight, I had 43kg, my wife had 43.8kg and my son had 44kg. I showed the attendant at the check in counter my 2 receipts (20kg + 25kg). She said their system is showing that i have only 25kg for each of us. I explained to her that i did 2 transactions and i showed her my receipts. The explanation she gave me is that the second transaction was only for an additional 5kg even if i bought for 25kg and this is how their system works.  She charged me an additional AUD 300. Since I didn't want to miss the flight, i didn't have other options to pay but under dispute.",1
Kolkata to Hyderabad. Check-in staff pleasant. Cabin crew professional and courteous. Aircraft clean but seats very tight. For a 2-hour flight the low price was more important than seat comfort.,0
Flew AirAsia from Jakarta to Bali and overall it was a pleasant flight. I've enjoy reading their magazines as a replacement to the IFE - which is understandable as it is a low cost carrier. The flight attendants were nice and the landing was pretty smooth.,0
"Do not fly Jetstar! Round trip Melbourne to Densapar, Bali were riddled with poor customer service, cancellations, no communication (it would take me too long to write all the problems I encountered including being put on the wrong flight). I understand the overnight return flight I was on is cancelled regularly. Our cancellation was due to 'safety' concerns so purchaser beware. If this is happening regularly you have to wonder what is happening to their fleet. It cost me $500 to return home to Canada because of their delays and cancellations. I had to bump other flights. They have turned down my request for compensation.",1
"Booked a Lion Air flight from Bali to Jakarta because I had a connecting flight to Europe 4 hrs later after arriving to Jakarta. When checking status of flights same day as I should fly, there's no such flight - checking mail and in the spambox is a mail from Lion Air (late from previous day), saying that my flight is cancelled and I have a ticket for a flight 1 hr later. Fine I thought, mailed the Lion Airs customer service and asked if they know if the flight is on time and how I best can take me from terminal 3 to terminal 2 in Jakarta and explained that is important for me to check in 2 hrs before my connecting flight to Europe. Only answer I got was that it is not possible for me to cancel a flight per e-mail and no other information. Mailed them back asking what kind of customer service is this when not answering any of the questions I asked and told them that I'm not trying to cancel my flight, just trying to make sure that I will get to terminal 2 in time, of course no answer to my second mail. Got to Denpasar 3 hrs before my flight to Jakarta just to meke sure everything's ok, checking in with my old ticket and was told that my flight is 1 hr later as I already knew, asked if the flight is on time, they assured me so. Boarding half an hour later and departed 1 h 15 mins late, landed, waited for my baggage 45 mins, tried to take a shuttle bus to other terminal, it never came, took an overpriced taxi, but it was worth it, and I got to the check in 1 hr before my connecting flight. Only just made it and never been so stressed. Worst airline I ever used and the customer service is a joke! I learned a lesson also, always read feedback before booking anything, if I'd checked feedback on Lion Air before booking I'd chosen another company, I suggest you do the same.",1
Taipei to Singapore in September. Efficient check-in at counter. No web check in. Staff friendly. Chose standard seat. Leg space was good (unlike some budget airlines with the front seat right up to your knees). Seat was rather uncomfortable - hard no lower back support - couldn't sleep all night. Hefty 4% visa processing fee shown only after payment (not included in fare like JetStar). Will use again but will bring small pillow for back.,0
New Delhi to Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi. Only Indigo has a direct flight in this sector at the time of writing. The flight experience was very good. Fare was cheap as booked early online selected the meal plus seating combination- Indigo Plus. Check-in and boarding was efficient flight departed and reached destination on time as per schedule. Though selected a standard seat on row 3the legroom was very comfortable. The aircraft was new and interior was clean. The only bad thing was the pre booked food booked online wasn't up to expected quality. Not sure whether its because we ordered vegetarian meal.,0
"I flew HNL-SYD and a month later SYD-HNL. I was actually traveling from Vancouver to SYD, and broke up the trip by flying Air Canada YVR-HNL return for about $550, and the Jetstar for about $1100 (plus all the extras). I had to stay one night in HNL each way, adding $500 hotel. With the Jetstar extras the cost perhaps $500 less than a direct flight. Plus I was trying to break up the 15/16 hour nonstop flight duration.  Jetstar : I had a cordial reception checking in at HNL. The rest of the staff throughout the rest of the trip were indifferent. The Boeing 787 is a nice airplane, as they go. I paid extra for a good seat, which was a great boon on full flights. That was good value for money. I paid $40-ish for the meal: it was a rude joke both times. The meal was mushy, minimal and miserable, and you needed to wait 15 minutes for a drink to wash it down. The most demeaning part of the experience was getting dinged $125 for my 5 kilos overweight baggage on my return. There wasn't a weight scale where I was staying, so I couldn't have prepared myself for the problem. My carry-on backpack was at the carry-on weight limit, so I couldn't switch items into that. So it was either pay the money or toss out some of my clothes. I paid, and then fumed for the next hour or two. The only way Jetstar can avoid this kind of rude greeting for a customer would be to give staff some leeway on the overweight rule. But they were very stern. In most of the reviews people are willing to forgive Jetstar's faults because of the lower prices. I don't agree. A price is a price and a fault is a fault. If Jetstar worked on its faults, and upped its prices slightly, it could delight customers instead of annoying them, as it so often does. I think I'll flight direct next time, either Qantas or Air Canada.",1
We booked a holiday deal to the Hayman Islands for travel between 6/9 - 9/9. We arrived at the airport on time to check-in as their mobile check-in services were down. We were advised by a very rude staff claiming the service counter closed ages ago meaning they decided to close their counter earlier. We showed him we had sufficient time to check-in but he ignore us and denied boarding. We have no choice but to transfer our ticket the next flight on the following day for $50pp losing one night hotel stay and half day on the island. Both the airport staff and call center service was appalling. No consideration or sympathy whatsoever. Will never fly with them again.,1
Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.,1
"My flight to Singapore was uneventful as usual except the aircraft cleanliness was bad. Upon arrival in Singapore, I found my suitcase badly dented and reported the damaged to Scoot's handling agent, SATS in Singapore. SATS will not handle the damage and directed me to to claim from Scoot Insurance Assessor online. That evening I dutifully submitted the claim with all supporting photos from SATS, boarding pass, etc. Response was prompt however unhelpful, it directed me to claim from my travel insurer which I refused. A reply from the Scoot's assessor requesting the same documents that were submitted in the online claim. Resend. Reply again requesting for same documents. Explained and objected. Reply and requesting for more photos! The whole process made my trip rather unpleasant! I decided to ignore that email. I was only claiming SGD 200 for the 2 year old damaged suitcase. I will definitely not recommend flying Scoot to friends!",1
"Singapore to Bali. First and last time traveling with this airline. We paid double the fare to board ourselves to a later flight in the day due to arriving late at airport. The check-in staff assured us to board us onto the next flight. The price difference is nothing short of predatory pricing. AirAsia insists on an all-in tix plus luggage overweight charges, airport taxes and everything else. Fine, we did as per their recommendation and waited 2 hours to the ""next flight"". But the airline delays an extra 2 hours (this is only a 2 hours flight) and our first day of the vacation is almost over. Do yourself a favor and book Tiger/Scoot next time.",1
"Gold Coast to Sydney. You may find yourself waiting 2 hours for a 1h15 flight. no compensation, no apologies. I was going through Sydney to catch a flight back to London and instead of having an ample 2 hours time in Sydney to comute from domestic to international terminal, I found myself throwing money at a taxi driver just to make it to the check-in of my flight to Europe 5 minutes before the close. That's what it is to be a client. The reason was the plane was grounded for part of the day for engineering work. And I don't think any effort was made to provide another plane. Cherry on the cake, in Gold Coast airport, no assistance was available. there was no Jetstar staff inside security and to talk to them, I had to exit, walk to their counter, have them tell me i was going to miss my on-going flight and there was nothing they could do for me, then go back through security. 3 times. No Jet, no star. Happy Australia Day.",1
Return trip from Sydney to Nadi. The plane was on time on the outgoing trip. The seats were so uncomfortable I found it hard to find a comfortable position the chairs are too upright. The homebound trip the check-in gate opened up half an hour late. The plane was delayed for 2.5 hours. The entertainment was useless you had to pay for iPads and there weren't even enough on board. There wasn't enough food onboard on the homebound trip. You have to pay for everything. The only good thing is that staff were quite friendly.,1
Flew Sydney to Hobart for a Christmas break. Flights were cheap to buy and they turned out to both be on time so no complaints. Legroom is a bit cramped but for a two hour flight it's reasonable.,0
Goa to Kolkata. I would like to thank Nazia & Rosey as they helped me to find my wallet yesterday I lost it my flight from Goa to Kolkata they informed my sister and they co oparated and I got my wallet successfully with everything intact,0
"Delhi to Patna with IndiGo. Positive First: Good Airline, worth the money for budget travelers and students. Good staff and management, runs on time. Negative Points: Seating quality is poor, no inflight entertainment service available.",0
Manila to Cebu. I really like the service. Cabin crew was friendly. The cabin crew also had some fun games which made the flight confortable and entertaining. The legroom was really good. Upon arrival we boarded using a jet bridge which is comfortable and easy.,0
"Bangkok to Osaka. First flights on Scoot in their ScootBiz cabin, which is misleading as it is very much a premium economy product. On balance it was a good experience, and in line with my expectations. Both flights were punctual, check in and boarding were reasonably efficient (you'd expect such at KIX, less so at DMK, but both were good). I was quite impressed with the cabin crews - they were very professional, warm and efficient. Seats were comfortable enough, although don;t expect lie flat, just a bit more recline. The only real negatives were 1) quirky IFE which runs on your laptop, tablet or phone - despite multiple downloads of plugins, flash players, etc I encountered compatibility problems throughout with hardware, browsers, etc and ultimately just gave up - this is far harder and more complicated than it should be, 2) on the outbound flight DMK-KIX the biz cabin was filled with babies and infants (due to school holidays in SG and MY I am guessing). I actually had a mum with lap child in the seat next to me and there is no way the child was under two years old (ie - needs a ticket). With all of the crying/screaming, etc I voluntary downgraded to the economy 'quiet zone', where the crew gave me a full row to myself - felt it was the right decision and appreciate the crew's assistance in ensuring my comfort. It is ironic though that Scoot charges more for economy passengers to sit in a quiet zone, yet offers no comparable alternative for biz passengers who are paying more money for their seat - this makes no sense to me, and 3) the whole idea of paying for in seat power (economy only) is another example of the pay for play model of low cost carriers, and suspect will be more broadly adapted by competitors. To summarise, the experience was good, not great, but acceptable. One additional insight re AirAsia X, Jetstar and Scoot long haul - Jetstar and Scoot are very similar experiences (both Dreamlines with 2-3-2 configuration with limited recline - Air Asia X the better product due to their flat bed offering on the less attractive A330.",0
"This is my second flight on AirAsia. Flight from Kuala Lumpur to Banda Aceh (AK423/15NOV) was about 75 minutes and was uneventful. We were 23 minutes late in departing but arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule. I was seated in seat 22D and it was very tight. My next Air Asia flight, I will pay extra for the Emergency Exit seat for comfort.",0
"Vishakapatanam to Bangalore. A huge thanks to IndiGo manager at Vishakapatanam airport. There was a 2 hour delay in the flight and my connecting flight from Hyderabad to Bangalore flight was a sure miss. When I contacted the manager, he was kind enough to attend to my problem and did resolve it and rescheduled my flight directly from vishakapatanam to Bangalore. My issue was resolved within half an hour. I'm really grateful for your kind assistance sir.",0
Cairns  to Gold coast. One of the worst airlines Ive flown ! I had two boarding passes and 14kgs luggage. They still charged me an extra $60 and wanted my baggage to go in check-in luggage. I couldnt believe how they could do this. Whilst complaining they didnt want to listen and just wanted to do what they want. Id pay that extra fee next time to fly with virgin Australia.,1
"Flew to Caticlan with 5J 903, the flight was smooth from Manila, there was flight delay but didnt bring any hassle. Until we arrived in a Caticlan 5 Dec 2022, around 230pm a dainty decent airport, so here its goes they don't have conveyer for the baggage and I stood up on the stage where they were placing the bags to be collected, then staff called me out, I immediately step down and apologized but he was so rude and unprofessional when a coworker he was telling him what happened in a very gossipy manner like he is just in the street and not in his uniform working!",0
"Rude staff, substandard quality of service and they will loot your money over excess baggage weight and other surprise fees not warned to the customer beforehand on their website. Their website for example provides the fee for pre booked additional baggage weight but does not mention the fee if excess baggage is found during boarding.",1
It's fares were similar to other full service carriers minus the in flight catering. After I was unable to travel on my previous flight to BOM I had to book another flight quickly so I managed to find this flight which came at a modest cost (compared to other carriers) due to the late night departure. The boarding and departure were on time.,1
I recently tried Star Class fom Auckland to Singapore. It was either that or travelling Singapore Airlines in economy class for the same price. I have to say that Star Class was much better value. The seats were fine. The meal service choice was good - had a delicious lamb casserole. The staff were attentive and I had trouble getting extra drinks. The on demand entertainment system worked fine and the choice was okay. Overall I found the experience was good. The only gripe I had was the unseat power failed halfway during the journey. Overall the experience was good I will certainly fly Jetstar Star Class again.,0
Flew with Jetstart to Bali back in May 2019 and they cancelled our flight home to Melbourne and couldn't get us on a flight for 10 days back to Melbourne. My husband and I missed two days of work and spent approximately $1400 with another airline to get home. Jetstar refused to refund our flight and would only give us a voucher. Had no desire to ever travel with them again but then would have forfeited the $720 voucher. Ended up using the voucher to go to Hobart for the weekend. Jetstar cancelled out flight going home to Melbourne. Spent 40 minutes on the phone trying to get another flight home. Got one 9 hours later then that flight was delayed by 40 minutes Arrived home at 1.30am and had to get up for work at 6.15am so extremely tired for work that day. Have had a couple of flights with Jetstar over the years and every single one has been delayed. Will never fly with them again. Was advised by Jetstar they do no guarantee their flights.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. When I was planning the trip to Langkawi, AirAsia offered the cheapest tickets. So the price was the main factor while choosing AirAsia and I must say it was really good value for money. I checked in online and everything was really easy. At the airport we had to wait about 15 minutes in the queue for the bag drop, but that was totally normal. Boarding process was well-organised. The staff on-board was very kind and helpful. The legroom was quite short for me, but as the flight took only one hour, it was easily bearable. In conclusion, it was really good decision to take AirAsia for such a short flight, as their price was unbeatable and they offer really good variety of services for additional cost, which are very convenient.",0
Sydney to Kuala Lumpur then onto Phuket. Trip over went ok return trip was a disaster. I received a notification from the airline that there would be a delay at Kuala Lumpur I tried to get a later flight from Phuket to no avail. On arrival at Kuala Lumpur the transfer desk had one employee there so 1.5 hrs in a queue then immigration another 1 hr in a queue then a 10 hr delay at the airport. No explanation no apologies just a voucher for a hamburger. Never Again.,1
AirAsia Philippines: MNL-KBO-MNL. This budget airline surprised me in almost every aspect I can think of. Ground and Cabin Crew were friendly both outbound and inbound flight were on time price was reasonable. Although its unfortunate that they are still stationed at the old manila domestic airport I can say that it doesn't mean the other local airlines using the new airport terminal are better. I can even say that my experience with Air Asia was way more pleasant compared to the others.,0
Jetstar flight from Singapore to Melbourne cancelled at short notice without reason. Rebooked us on a delayed flight to Brisbane. No information at all from the airline upon arrival at Singapore. We were left to fend for ourselves - a family with small children. Flying to Brisbane but still unclear how we will get to Melbourne. Avoid at any cost.,1
SIN-OOL-SIN flight TZ006 and TZ005. SIN-OOL check in could have been a lot faster as we were the first few in line. Boarding was slow but smooth. The taxi and takeoff roll were done professionally. Food was served 1.5hrs after takeoff had lasagne which was not too bad its better to pre-order online to prevent long waiting times. For the rest of the flight I slept. Outbound flight ended well with a smooth landing but the immigration at Gold Coast wasn't very fast at all. OOL-SIN a long line at check in followed by another long line at immigration and boarding once on board managed to rest until takeoff. Food served 1.5hrs into the flight and had the lasagne meal which includes pepsi and fruit chips. Landing was fairly smooth. Overall I think Scoot is a fairly reasonable airline if you just want to eat and sleep my advice would be to download movies on a tablet and bring it onboard to past the time.,0
First there was a delay leaving Sydney on Friday then as we got into Melbourne there was another delay. So we had to circle for a good 30 minutes before we were finally allowed to land. Intentionally booked an earlier flight home on Monday 7th October for a family gathering on Labour. Got a text 2.5 hours before flying time to be told flight has been cancelled. No earlier flight home and earliest available is 6.45pm. Well done Jetstar thank you for screwing up my long weekend. I totally understand there are unexpected delay from time to time. But somehow you managed to make this a constant occurrence every time I choose you fly with Jetstar. Think this is where we part ways never again lesson learnt.,1
It was a morning flight departing KUL at 8:20AM and arriving DMK at 9:30AM. Flight departed and arrived on time. Proper announcements were made by the cabin crew and the pilots. Cabin crew on this flight were pretty active. Aircraft had a special livery (Allstars Livery)(reg no 9M-AFD). Interior of the aircraft was pretty worn out and the aircraft had started to show its age. Did not pre-order anything or buy onboard anything.,0
Having previously experienced delays and cancellations with Jetstar I was curious to see how this flight would be. Overall it was very good. I paid $39 for Sydney to Melbourne (Avalon) and it was money well spent considering the alternative flights at the same time with other airlines to Melbourne (Tullamarine) were much more expensive. The flight was a good example of what a LCC should be. On time departure and arrival friendly crew a clean A320 and surprisingly comfortable seats. I am 180cm and my knees were not touching the seat in front perhaps due to the clever re-positioning of the magazine pocket to the top of the seat-back above the meal tray. I would fly Jetstar again if the price is right.,0
"I have only bad words about this airline. Seats are hard, don't even have a pocket in front to put the water, many flights are delayed and canceled but worse than anything: They don't care at all about customer satisfaction, if there is any kind of problem you will receive no help at all! Been billed without my permission, called customer service and all they have to say ""was an automated process so we can't help"". Completely useless, I would never recommend this airline to anyone!",1
Adelaide to Cairns return in April. We paid extra for front row seats D E and F behind the bulkhead which separates galley from cabin. There was not much information on the net about Row 1 seats and we were not sure if the legroom would be the same as in the exit row seats further back as (from memory) Row 1 pre-selected seats are a little cheaper. Our seats were great! Plenty of legroom and didn't have the claustrophobic feeling that can be experienced in an economy cabin. Row 1 seats A B and C have even more leg room with no bulkhead in front. Take your own food and hire an I-Pad and with a bit of a stretch of the imagination is a bit like flying a budget business class! Crew friendly. Would have liked more talk from the cockpit and maybe a second trolley run on the 3 hour flight.,0
Ipoh to Singapore. First time in Malaysia and not sure what expect. At the airport ground staff were very friendly and helpful. On the aircraft again friendly and helpful. If I visit Asia again and need to use an airline then I would certainly consider Scoot,0
"Absolutely disgusting, would not fly with them again! When I booked it didnt give me any info or luggage options. It already wasnt a cheap flight. Then I rang and checked and they said I had no luggage included so I went online to add it and it came up in Thai baht as 2675 which is Aussie $114! I rang again which took several days in fact, as after ten times calling after ten mins it would cut me off. When I finally got through they said because it was a connecting flight they charge me twice! Never have I struck this, even with the most budget of budget airlines they dont do this! And on top of that they charge double the normal rate as theres only 20 or 25 kg so I had to go with 25 and its about $57 per flight! Thats way over normal and to charge twice too! I will never fly with them again! And as a loyal Singapore Airlines customer who regularly flies with them, as they are the same company they have lost me completely. I wont fly with them again either. If I had known this I would have chosen a different company. It really wasnt a cheap flight so the whole budget thing doesnt stick with me. The whole thing has cost me about $700 one way when you can sometimes get that ticket fir $300. So its insult to injury!",1
"aCovid happened and the world went into meltdown, flight cancelled and I wanted a refund -  what an awful awful process. Never known anything like it. Cant speak to anyone, and the virtual assistant is just infuriating (possibly the worst one I have ever used) sends you round in circles, no option for live chat and doesnt seem to learn. Obviously its all done to put you off claiming a refund. As for live chat, well you will wait literally hours for a person to come back to you, if at all. Genuinely the worst customer service I have ever received.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Ho Chi Minh City with AirAsia. The flight took off as scheduled as the plane was not full and the crew were able to ready the plane quickly. There was no pre-departure announcement by the captain. The flight was generally smooth. The landing was good.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Bali. As usual, online check-in for Airasia is available, until the last 24 hours before the flight. Departing to the flight is seamless and ground staff were helpful. When the plane leaving the aerobridge, there were some passengers that still stand at aisle and not on their seat, and pretty sure that is dangerous. During the flight, staff were really friendly and helpful. There were some turbulence during the flight, but no big deal. However, pre-booked meal that I had was terrible. Spiral pasta with sausages was plain and sad. Not recommended.",0
Perth to Bali. A320. Booked hot seats row 1. Meal included but we weren't priority boarded as the website indicated. Crew friendly and helpful. Flight slight turbulence but arrived on time. New plane. Only hiccup was online check in with no luggage says we can go straight to departure gate but lucky we checked as you still need to go to web check in desk to reprint boarding pass. Plus many passengers in the wrong line up. One row for online web check and one not. Ground staff didn't appear interested that all passengers queuing all in one line. Signage was poorly indicating.,0
"Singapore to Melbourne. Flight to Melbourne got cancelled one hour before plane was due to fly. We were in queue for more than 2 hours for the service desk before another passenger told us that we could call in to re-booked. Staff on the call was unsure of process, gave differing advice and had to put me on hold several times to check the refund process for hotel stay. In the end i was re-booked on another flight one day later. No compensation was given at all. I had to forfeit my hotel stay and airport transfer that I missed in Melbourne. Will not fly with Jetstar next time.",1
I paid my ticket with my credit card. Within seconds Cebu Pacific the money was transferred. Regrettably I could not fly and asked Cebu Pacific for a refund of the taxes. Cebu Pacific agreed but since two months they don't pay back my money.,1
"I travel with Indigo a lot and about half the time I regret it. They have all sorts of arbitrary rules that don't affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience. For example, a few times I've arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day. Every time they refuse despite having plenty of space - apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing. Today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg. Why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane? Lack of flexibility and customer orientation on this airline is consistently staggeringly bad. And it really irritates my sense of efficiency and reasonableness.",1
"7th May from Jakarta to Denpasar Bali. Flight QZ7532. Every single time I flew AA the flight was delayed. They usually use a random excuse like ""delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft"". This time 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA I thought that was extremely bad. They can't care less about their passengers.",1
They are cramping together all people that don't purchase expensive seat reservations (100 usd). Despite airplane is 3/4 empty they won't allow you to take free seats but you will be forced to stay cramped since you didn't pay for seat reservation.,1
"Flight was my teenage daughters first flight by herself, even though she is 19 she is still a young lady by herself, it was to leave at 4.45, did not board until 5.15 left at 5.55pm, not too awful, so I was not worried too much, but they got diverted to Avalon in Melbourne instead of flying direct to Tullamarine, so instead of my daughter getting to the airport at 7.50pm or at the latest 8.30pm, they finally get there at after 11pm. She is by herself has to catch a bus to the city, does not no if she will be able to check in to her hotel room by the time the sky bus gets her there, nothing is offered, no one cares. Glass of warm tap water is what they were offered while they spent hours on the tarmac, the cabin crew were down right uncaring and rude. All in all worst airline ever. Be better off going to Brisbane and going on Tigerair. Never ever will we fly with Jetstar Airways again. Leaving people stranded for hours and not caring at all, nice one Jetstar. So many people missed flights to other places, missed their buses you name it. So instead of being safe in her hotel room at a good time of night my daughter was left to do all of this into the early hours of the next morning. She was to be there before 8 people, think of that that is not good enough.",1
Denpasar to Sydney with Jetstar Airways - extremely poor communication and service. Had thought the lack of coordination and shabby service on the way was just perception however on return I now understand this is simply Jetstar's standard. Flight was delayed without explanation by 5 hours and then further delayed by abother 3 hours. Airport staff unable to give details regarding onward connecting flights or expected time for arrival. For me the delay resulted in a 36 hour working day without apology or compensation. Not good enough Jetstar. This bare basic service is definitely not worth any minute ticket saving. Certainly would never travel use again.,1
"Sydney to Bangkok via Singapore. Nothing to complain. As a budget airline, much better than some main airlines. Flight was very comfortable, even without paying extra, legroom was same or better than regular airline. Cabin crew were very nice. All the four legs of my journey was on Boeing 787,  three times arrived at destinations 20 to 30 minutes early. Definitely don't worry about travelling next time with them.",0
"Flight from Bangkok's Don Muang Airport, DMK, to Singapore, SIN. Flight was slightly late, boarding was efficient and pleasant, flight attendants very friendly. Ordered a meal - was quite good for US$5. Seat comfort is ok, legroom is very limited, but is expected from low cost carriers. All in all a pleasant flight.",0
"Worst customer service ever. I flew Scoot from NRT to TPE and they deliberately did not load our baggage on our return flight. They put many people's suitcases off to the side at check in, and didn't tell us these bags wouldn't be on the plane. When we arrived in TPE it was chaos. None of the staff knew what was going on and we had to fill out a form to fill out a form later to get our bags. It took us 3 days to receive our luggage. The day after we landed, I emailed Scoot and sent a letter to their headquarters. I finally got a call from their customer service center 3 weeks after our flight. All they did was ask if we had received our bags. No compensation, no written apology, not even a verbal apology! I will never fly SCOOT again.",1
Dirty Plane. Trays were dirty and staff were asked to wipe several seat trays. No in flight entertainment. Uninterested staff who were very unaccommodating. Flew back to Perth on QZ534. Even worse experience as I travelled back with my husband and child. We were separated and yet there were several free seats available. We asked if we could sit together as we had a 1 year old with us. They said the plane was full and yet there were several seats available. At the end of the trip I asked to help my husband with the bags as he was carrying the baby. They refused to let me and said I couldn't go back on the plane. They then stood around and watched him struggle to carry the bags and the baby instead of offering to help. They were so uninterested and looked like they weren't enjoying their job. Dissatisfied. Worst experience on an airline.,1
"Ok this short one hour hop from Penang to Singapore, I chose Scoot. Scoot is a low cost airline. I had the emergency row seat which offered good leg space. There is no personal entertainment system on board. Drinks and snacks are for purchase and I pre-ordered a snack pack comprising a bottle of mineral water, pop corn and chocolates for RM45. I did not have any expectations from a low cost airline so it serves its purpose by getting me to my destination at a low price.",0
"Brisbane to Sydney. Unhelpful, rude and didn't care about me making my international flight in Sydney. Would not recommend to anyone. The worst flying experience I've ever had. I would recommend flying any other airline besides this one.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Cebu. You need to go to the airport 3 hours before because the check-in staff were slower than usual. They didn't hold to boarding and flight time even while on time. The planes are quite uncomfortable but I don't mind that. The airline has no online customer service other than their AVA chat program. They have nothing to answer even just simple general questions.,1
"Long story short. Flight was cancelled. Couldnt get us alternative flight to Sydney within 24hours even if we drove to Brissie or Gold Coast. Decide to be on call for next flight- it is also cancelled. Drive to Ballina to fly out morning next day. Lose day in Sydney, lose accommodation cost, costs us fuel, night accommodation in Ballina and parking costs. But this is not the final straw. The final straw is on return journey our luggage is 6kg over (combined 3 people), same weight as when we flew there, and they charged us $120 - what the. Could have charged us $60 for one person being over or $45 to check one bag but nope charge us for two bags being over (werent aloud to split with between three of us). They were rude and didnt care that they had already cost us over $400 for our one day holiday that was meant to be a weekend away for my sons birthday. Was a regular customer and had a Jetstar card. No more.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne via Avalon. Endless delays - engineering problems, late incoming airplane, etc. Simply operational incompetence. Horrible customer service with no interest to keep good customer relationship or protect company reputation. One of the worst airlines at times even outperforming Tiger. No more JetStar, enough is enough. Now Qantas and Virgin for domestic flights in Australia.",1
Utapao to Kuala Lumpur. On December 16th I travelled from Pattaya to Kuala Lumpur. It was a great flight and very comfortable. I like the Pattaya airport a lot and it is very small and comfortable.,0
"Officially the worst airline I've had the chance to fly. Ryanair, doesn't even come close and they are a pretty terrible airline. I am a very reasonable person who believes customers should be treated as if they were going to fly with the company again, in Cebu Pacific's case I don't think the staff have heard of the term ""customer service"". Here's my story - I flew from NRT (Tokyo) to SYD (Sydney) and I purchased this ticket with the thought of having a good tourist layover in Manila. Oh was I wrong. I had to add a bag to my checked bag luggage, well this airline expects 48 hours notice in Tokyo so naturally I assume okay, I will need to pay an extra baggage fee because it's outside of the time slot. Not great but I didn't read their regulations ahead of time. My mistake was thinking I would be covered on my second flight. The airline was less than accommodating because there was a 24 hour layover in Manila I had to pay baggage fees twice and ended up spending over $100 in fees to ship a backpack which weighed 10kgs back to Sydney. I spoke with the manager in Manila and he said there was nothing they could do. To add to the matter, the seats are bricks, and the food was terrible. All in all, I hate to complain but when a company is strictly after profits and does anything to get their employees to act this way there is a huge problem. Pay the extra $50-60 to fly any other airline!",1
"March 9 2013. DMK-KUL AK1941. March 12 2013 KUL-DMK FD2916. You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty.",1
MEL-SYD return. Both flights delayed 30 mins. Seat pitch on A320 on the way up very tight. Lucky had empty middle seat. Ok for short flights but for anything longer than 2 hours very uncomfortable. A321 on flight back. Seat pitch marginally better. Both flights very smooth and cabin crew did their jobs ok.,1
"Excellent experience with ZIPAIR, from quick and very kind check in assistant, to a timely and pleasant flight. Was very lucky to get the seat with more leg space, so it was not as hard a night as I feared. I slept all night so no idea if there was food and how much it cost.",0
"Not even a greeting getting on the plane? First time reviewer. The plethora of reviews surrounding this airline do not lie. To save time, let me first list the positives of my flights and then the problem areas. Positives: No delays. Flight arrivals were timely. Unloading was fast. Wifi was available for free. Problems: No staff acknowledgement getting on the plane to any passengers. Did not have Malaysian currency (coming from Vietnam) and was not allowed to pay by credit card so that I could have a bottle of water! Cue tip in the seat pocket from previous flight. Decor is most budget I have seen, carpet does not cover the whole floor of the plane and the stains/tears in the leather seating is obvious. Staff (not all) lacked a positive attitude toward the passengers. The rest is what you would expect from a budget airline i.e. tight, uncomfortable seating, no in-flight entertainment, no complimentary food/beverages, complimentary wifi was limited, no power supply, etc. This is a classic point A to point B service, which was delivered. However, there is budget flying and then there is Air Asia budget flying. Do not recommend.",1
Cochin to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. There is practically no leg space. Add to it the fact that I had a window seat with the other two seats filled in by slightly heavyset people and I felt like I didn't even have breathing space. It was so cramped that I didn't have space to move my hands. The choice of food on board is poor. Even when I asked for something that was on the menu they didn't have it. The only good thing was the rate but given the condition of the flight even the cheap rates do not sound tempting.,1
"Bali to Mumbai. My flight supposed to depart at 03.10pm, on 31 March. They allowed passengers to check in at 11.00 am but didn't inform them about the delay. Once the immigration process was completed, then they changed departure time to 07.00pm. Now passengers don't have any option other than waiting. There wasn't any AirAsia executive present at the gate. We also didn't get any vegetarian food at Bali Airport. The airline provided food as it was delayed, but they ordered Non-Vegetarian food only. They should have some common sense that Non-Vegetarian people can eat Vegetarian food, but Vegetarian people cannot eat Non-Vegetarian food. Most of the co passengers were absolutely frustrated. They promised us that they would provide Vegetarian food on the flight. But when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. I really will not recommend this AirAsia to anyone. While going to Bali from Mumbai, one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with AirAsia is different. Generally 1 INR = 210 IDR(app). But with Air Asia, 1 INR = 100 IDR. That was so pathetic. I wanted to choose twin seats while web checkin. The Customer support misguided me. They told me there wasn't any twin seats available in flight so I ended up booking different seats paying equal amount. And actually twin seats were there. This airline is bearable for those whose height is less than 165 Centimeters and a journey of max 3 hours. I will not travel via Air Asia again even if they provide me free tickets. I will not target the inflight entertainment and seating comfort as it is a low cost carrier. We should not expect more from it. It is just a plane which have seats with little cushion onto it. It take off from source and lands at destination. That's all. I hope this review will be valuable for all future travelers.",1
SIN-KUL. After flying around Europe with Ryanair and easyjet the service of AirAsia feels better FA's were more caring. 6 seats across in B737 the leg room is tight even for an Asian who is 1.78m tall. For just under an hour flight this was tolerable.,0
"Manila to Jakarta with Cebu Pacific. Arrived at NAIA T3 I checked in to my flight. The ground crew personnel were not friendly. Boarding was quick but there's a hold before enter the jetbridge about 15 minutes. Another delay after all passengers entered the aircraft summed up to a total of 45 minutes of delay, which means we would arrive some 30 minutes behind scheduled arrival time. Later in the flight, I purchased a chicken meal and a blanket. The meal was okay, it's a typical meal that you'll get on convenience store but a little pricey and the taste a bit worse. The blanket is very thin in my opinion. Finally landed 50 minutes behind schedule. Overall the flight was good but I would consider whether to fly or not with Cebu again, since the ground experience was bad and the flight was not really that good.",0
"Our experience flying Scoot from Melbourne to Taipei via Singapore was a miserable one. The cabin was hot, as there are no overhead airvents it just got worse as the flight went on. What makes this issue worse is they charge you a lot for water when they are running a very hot cabin. I wrote to Scoot feedback about this issue and they confirmed they run the cabin at 24c degrees. Once the sun streams in through the windows and there's no cool air in the cabin it feels a lot hotter. From this flight my mother got sick and she was unwell for the rest of our trip. I read all the negative reviews of Scoot but went into flying with them with an open mind but I couldn't ignore how uncomfortable flying with them is. Next the seats, after a few hours it feels like a metal bar is pushing into your lower back, I found them unbearable, the food wasn't much better. Because of this we changed carriers when we flew back and went Emirates, which after you add all the add ons on Scoot really wasn't much more expensive. It was like night and day - we had ventilation, the food was decent and the seats comfortable . Why do Scoot run the cabins so hot and why no ventilation. These are basic needs of human comfort. The cabin attendants were rude - one had a fair old go at my mum for eating a sandwich she bought at the airport.  Once we landed in Singapore they parked at a stand and bussed us to the terminal, considering the amount of clear gates, is this really necessary ?",1
Jetstar is the worst airline my partner and I have ever flown. The flights are delayed every single time we have flown. No food vouchers or any compensation were ever offered. Their staff are rude and inconsiderate not to mention they know nothing to do with what's going on. They have never been helpful in any situation we have encountered with them (which are many). We were moved to a separate flight on another occasion and had to talk to 4 people before they moved us back and when we questioned why we were moved in the first place they wouldn't answer and we are positive it's because the flight was oversold. There are consistently issues with their flights and we will never be flying with them again.,1
"Tokyo Narita to Bangkok. ScootBiz is not worth the money. Your bag does not get a ScootBiz label. Therefore your bag doesn't come first. I had to wait for offloading almost to the end - ScootBiz has no own exit from the plane. You have to go back through economy class to get out. What a hassle - seat is not flatbed and has small recline only. It was uncomfortable, I got back pain. No blanket, no pillows are provided - you can only close the blinds electronically 1 hour after take off. Enjoy the sun in your eyes for the first hour. I didn't know you need to download an app before getting on board: I missed the movies - the cutlery is plastic and such bad quality.",1
Avoid this airline at all costs. They will cancel flights and not provide any information or alternative. Basically will abandon you at whatever airport they wish with no information or help. I guess you get what you pay for but this airline really scrapes the bucket.,1
"Flew in indigo from Dubai to Chennai. Flight departed after 1 and half hours from the scheduled time. Beverage - Paid for alcoholic beverage while booking the ticket and ended up getting paper boat pomegranate juice. Food, ordered chicken curry rice, but for the first time in my life had to eat poor rice.",1
TRZ-KUL-DPS-JOG and CGK-KUL-MAA. Travelled in the month of November 2014. Booked the tickets few months in advance good deal. All are A320 aircraft's neat and clean. Both ground staff and crew are good in service. Departed / Landed on time. Hope to travel again. Strongly recommend others for travelling in Air Asia.,0
"Dehradun to Pune via Delhi. Most disorganized and inefficient airline I have ever travelled with. Multiple delays, standing in line for over 8+ hours and talking with customer service on the phone for 5+ hours with no help at all. Do not fly with this airline.",1
"Perth to Singapore, and upgraded to Scootbiz. Overall another great experience with Scoot. Love the priority boarding, friendly crew and the roomy seats. Only issue with these seats is that they are good if you are over 185 cm the head rest digs into your neck, the seats on the old Boeing 777 were actually more comfortable. You either have to sit lower in your seat, not comfortable or just having to cope with the head rest digging in. Flight on time, took off on time, as for entertainment take your own table and have your own movies. Food is ok and I think the whole experience is good value for money.",0
Flew CNS-BNE return over weekend. (6-7 September). I booked Jetstar due the the cheap flights on offer. I purchased a bundle which came with a food voucher and choice of seat and QFF and was happy with the value. Big points on being able to order hot food now (ham and cheese toastie or pieface box). Check in times were satisfactory. Staff were friendly. Nothing exceptional but more then adequate. I would love to see the food menu extended even if I have to pre-order prior to boarding. Seat pitch okay but a bit confining when the seat in front reclined but again budget airline so it is what it is.,0
"Singapore to Krabi. Essentially we had missed the time for check in and based on airport and airline procedure we would have been unable to board. One of Scoots on ground staff however went out of her way to help us with this, calling the flight captain who kindly agreed to open the counter for us. They went out of their way and were empowered to do so, and in so doing provided us a superior customer experience. A big thank you to both of them and shout out for the exemplary customer service.",0
"Flew Manila to Tokyo. Jetstar Airways, the most inconsiderate airline I have experienced, Ive been flying a lot every year in the last 20 years both personal and job related and the ground crew in Tokyo are the rudest and most inconsiderate crew I have ever dealt with. I wil never fly with this airline again.",1
"Yesterday (11 july) I brought my 90 year old mother back and from entry to exit, each member of IndiGo staff provided exemplary care. From wheelchair to security to plane they took genuine care. The surprise started by Sujata politely asking if we would like front row seats, which I had wanted but while booking couldn't get. That gave us comfort in 2 hours flight and Sujata accompanied us through security, which often can be cumbersome. Other staff too helped selflessly. Cabin crew was kind. Covid protocols are followed to a T by IndiGo. In Bengaluru on arrival Keertana helped and escorted all through till exit. It made travel with a near blind, wheelchair bound mother very doable. Thank you IndiGo. Way to go!",0
"Sydney to Melbourne Avalon. First, the good part. The aircraft was in OK condition, my seat was bearable for a one hour flight, Jetstar got me to my destination on time and my bag arrived on the baggage carousel. But it's very difficult to travel on this airline without thinking that they take every opportunity to shakedown their customers. In the departure lounge, I witnessed people being asked for more money for their carry-on. Thanks to other posters on this site, I knew in advance to check in my bag (which other airlines accept as carry-one without question), so it didn't affect me personally. I had bought a starter-plus bundle, which at the time of purchase was claimed to offer standard seat allocation, a baggage allowance, frequent flyer points, and a snack. When I received the itinerary, there was no mention of the snack. Equally, when I received the boarding pass, there was no mention of the snack, either, but there was a four digit code, so I asked a crew member at checkin what the four digit code was and she replied that it was because I had paid to have my seat allocated in advance (seat allocation is part of the starter-plus bundle). When the cabin crew were promoting the sale of snacks and drinks, they said that they would accept Mastercard, Visa, or American Express, but they said nothing about people who had bought the starter-plus bundle. When the crew member serving snacks got to my seat, I showed her the boarding pass and asked her if it entitled me to a snack. Yes, she said, your choice up to $10. Why don't they print this on the boarding pass and announce it when about to serve snacks? I nearly went without  I thought I must have got the wrong idea about what was included in the starter-plus bundle. I can't help but get the feeling the airline wanted me (and other starter-plus customers) to forget the fact that the bundle includes a snack. No doubt it's more profitable if people pay for a second time, or go without, as I nearly did. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth but, like the shakedown in the departure gate, seems typical of this airline, which only seems to care about opportunities for more money.",1
Very restrictive airline. They will nickle and dime you for anything you want. Nothing is offered free. Only allows each person 30 lbs combined of personal and carry on bag (thats about half their weight empty). They don't even offer you water on an 11 hour flight. Checked bags weight is overweight no matter what. Expect another $50 - $80 for each checked bag. Could not check in online. Could not print a boarding pass except at their desk. No frills. They usually get mad if you bring on your own food or drink too!,1
Gensan-Manila. A pleasant flight staff a bit scarce but helpful and nice. Aircraft was clean. Flights can be delayed but that is not just Cebu. A good low cost airline to get around the Philippines.,0
Badly organised boarding. Despite having on board water fountains the staff refused to supply a plastic cup without buying outrageously expensive water. Most customers around me were expecting to have to pay for toilet paper. No inflight entertainment available unless booked with purchase of ticket. Staff are friendly but either overworked or under trained. Overall I'll stay away from Budget airlines in the future.,1
DMK-SIN SIN-HKT HKT-DMK. DMK a joy no queues large open spaces as not many pax plenty of seats easy check in at airport with bags coming in right on the weight had paid for. Zero lines at passport control and security. Had exit row hot seats for 1st leg and they were great so much leg room. Cabin staff also enforced the seats with people trying to move in to the empty row in front of us and all were removed. Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy. I think if I was taking anything longer than 2 hours I would pay for the exit row. 3rd leg Phuket airport showing its age and in dire need of a revamp. but again no issues with TAA on arrival used jet way and bags arrived quickly.,0
Boeing 777 but felt more cramped than an Airbus 320 as the 777 carries more passengers. Service call button and light switch is too close to each other and in a position where a 2.5hr flight from SIN-BKK was nothing but a symphony of calls for service. Flew FlyBagEat. Was informed that my online pre-ordered Eat was not available. I declined offer of another meal and asked for a refund. They got me my pre-ordered meal from Biz Class. My Eat was only served to me 10 minutes before the plane started descent into BKK. I had to struggle with the factory sealed microwave meal it was sealed so tightly I really had to struggle to open it without creating a mess. Good thing I bought a one-way ticket on my inaugural flight with Scoot. My flight back to SIN was on Tiger Airways.,1
"Booked flight in April 2020 was canceled obviously because of corona no problem. However for months trying to get either a refund or credit and it is impossible to contact a human. Their super app says that the booking number is incorrect it is what they gave me ? All you do is talk to a bot tried email no reply only phone number person said they dont do it and wouldnt give another number or any help. Left comments on their FB no reply and currently AirAsia doesnt fly to Ho Chi Minh so cant even go to airport to talk to a ticket agent. The office they had closed two years ago so right now I literally cant talk to a human to get a refund. Will just have to kiss the money goodbye, I will never use this company again, why would anyone considering if you have any problems of any kind you cant talk to a customer service rep. Obviously this company has major financial problems.",1
"I used to travel frequently with AirAsia but recently the service is getting worse. More than half of my flight got cancelled / rescheduled to the inconvenient time. I need to rearrange my schedule and travel plan because of that. There is no proper way to complain as you will always be directed to AVA which can't settle your issue most of the time. Questions never be answered and customer service is basically not exist. Undeniable it offers the most affordable flight ticket but with the inconvenience caused by frequent reschedule/ cancellation and the worst customer service, it is not worthy of it.",1
"Auckland to Christchurch. Before my trip, I had purchased the particular seating both from and to Auckland. And Jetstar had sent me the confirmation of my seating after I had made the payment. When I got to the airport, I found out that they just simply changed my seats both from and to Auckland. I told them I had purchased the seat and had the confirmation for it. They didn't want to help at all.",1
"Just flew Jetstar Bangkok to Singapore on April 1st. Paid for additional $48 cabin baggage. When in plane, the staff says no more room for cabin baggage, they started carting the baggage out to the hold. I protested politely to the crew, I paid for that cabin space. They kept silent and continue to cart my bag out. Another passenger offered to make space by moving his luggage from top compartment to under his seat. I told the crew to bring my bag back as there is space, they relented and carted my bag back from outside the plane.",1
Our first was cancelled and rescheduled 5 hours later. It left Manila 2 hours late. We landed in Davao and waited for 40 minutes before we finally were able to get off plane. Yesterday our return flight to Manila was cancelled by Cebu Pacific. Disgraceful and shocking service. We along with so many others will never use Cebu Pacific again.,1
"Ahmedabad to Delhi. Aircraft departed from the gate on time (however, we were delayed taking off due to ""dogs on the runway"" apparently) The flight was good, service was good, bottled water wasn't expensive and we arrived into Delhi on time.",0
"This is the worst airline I have used. I flew from Singapore to Melbourne on Dec 3. I checked one bag in. When I got to Melbourne my bag was not on the plane. I went to the Scoot baggage desk to let them know, the women behind the desk never turned on a computer to see where it was, she just wrote my email address down on a piece of paper and said the baggage should be on the next flight the next day and that they would call. Nobody called so we call them and her answer was ""its not on the flight today I will have someone call you again nobody did. this same scenario has been repeated every day for a week now. When we try to call back, it is the same thing every day we get a recording stating that there is no one there please leave a message and still no one calls back. Even though they state they are open until midnight. I have sent many emails some have been answered some have not. they all say the some thing ""we are trying to track your luggage but have no record of it"" even after I have given them the tag information. I cannot understand how my bag has disappeared into thin air. Unfortunately scoot could not care less. I was in Australia for a wedding and had to buy all new clothes.",1
"I've bought a return ticket from them 12th April depart, 14th April return. They cancelled the departing flight 5 days prior, the next day I got an email says that they have rescheduled my departing flight to 14th April without my consent. That makes my itinerary like departing in the morning, stay at the destination for 30minutes then returning on the same day!? I lodged a case for refund with AirAsia thru their online chat bot, as I couldn't contact any of their customer service staff. My case status was closed by AirAsia, and I haven't get my refund back. I went to the airport to check with their counter staff, they said AirAsia have refunded me. I checked with my bank, and there are not a single dime from AirAsia.  There are no way to contact their person in charge for refund. The boarding counter staffs tell you to lodge your case online with the chatbot. You can spend 2 hours and get nowhere there.",1
"For a weekend trip from Sydney to Melbourne I had tried to use Qantas Group points and pay, only to find lots of  block outs on Sun afternoon. So ended up on Qantas domestic on the way down, and Jetstar on the way back up. At the time of booking I was able to get seating for QF 443, so not JQ 526. (And no, that Q doesn't stand for quality, more like questionable). Called JQ, after being on the phone got seating I wanted. Even got charged for it, though I wasn't advised of this. Although I have the QF app (which after the flight showed JQ526), I had to download the JQ one as well for some reason. All the way Tripit showed it as QF443 / QF478 operated by JQ (JQ526) Ah well. It then changed from exit row to + 4 rows to -1 row to ultimately another 11 rows and exit row. We got to the airport in time to get some dinner, then realised bag drop only available 2 hours before flight (and check in on the machine 3 hours before flight). It then asked if okay with exit row, but still got shuffled around. Though staff at the counter fixed it having seen some charge had been send through, which Amex showed as pending. Still not sure why. Flight was may be 3/4 full. Last time I flew JQ was probably a decade or so ago, thanks for reminding me why, even for short haul.",1
DEL-BKK-DEL with AirAsia. I got promo fares of 7000 rupees aircraft was good and flight was good. Also seats comfortable. I enjoyed vegetable briyani and it was delicious.,0
Flew LST-SYD - Check in took no time at all and the staff were very friendly on the ground and in the air. Cabin was very new well ventilated but most importantly clean. Despite being only an A320 the seats were much bigger than local domestic rival 737-800s and were much more comfortable. Would have been nice to have received complimentary beverage. Baggage claim was very quick and was ready exactly as I arrived at the carousel.,0
"My wife just booked flights and made a mistake booked flights on the right dates but the wrong way round. I rang jetstar to see if they could help me out to change these flights around to the right departure and arrival. I have flown with them for 4 years and when I speak to someone to get it changed they try to charge me $150 more than what it would cost me to rebook and lose the money I first booked with. All I got was ""it's policy"" nothing we can do but we are helping you the best way we can. It's ok when they change my flights have flights late with no word of a sorry or explanation.",1
"Flight 5J-962 on Aug 4. Nothing much to say, the flight was on time, the price was cheap, the staff were nice. No food or drinks unless you are willing to pay for it. Good experience flying from point A to point B.",0
12 June 2014. JQ 30 BKK-MEL. Business seat 1 F Boeing 787-8. First flight on a 787 and booked my normal 1F. At check in advised it was one 1 E. Due to language difficulties I could not understand why and my request for an explanation was polite but I was not able to master the meaning. I was informed it was a window seat so proceeded to the aircraft. I was then advised that I was in the second row. The reason I fly in row one is for the legroom and lack of a seat in my face for 9 hours making laptop use at times impossible. Again the explanation was difficult to understand and upon my insistence I eventually got back into 1F. It appears the IFE was U/S in seat 1F and the crew were trying to assist me. Lived without IFE. Food and service very good from an all Thai crew which is becoming the norm on this leg and JQ 29. Big drawback with the 787 in seat 1F is that the galley access is out of alignment with the seat so approximately one foot of the space in front of the seat is in line with the open galley. This means when the crew make their multiple visits the curtain hits the passengers legs. This could be some what alleviated with a retainer lower down the curtain. So for 787 flights I advise I will be sitting in 1B or 1J which are out of the way of the traffic flow by about 4 inches. The seats were reasonably comfortable with reasonable recline but footrests need improving as the rung like support is intrusive. Plane new and clean as you would expect. PA from flight deck was nearly indecipherable. This is a safety issue that needs attending to. The headset issued now has a 3 pin plug and subjectively the headsets don't seem as noise cancelling as the ones on the A330. A pity my Bose were in checked luggage as the 3 pin plug would not worth the headset with my phone or Ipad so no IFE and no music. Not the end of the world but an opportunity for better communication with customers one would have thought.,0
Our second trip with Scoot to Singapore. One out of Sydney and the latest from the Gold Coast. We aren't exactly the youngest passengers on flights (60's) so the blue seats get a bit (lot) cramped after takeoff plus an hour. This time we splurged and got yellow seats in the back of the plane. Also ordered a meal. Everything worked well and the meals were exactly what is/are required on an 8 hour flight. The small extra cost for the seats was well spent as we were in a bracket of two (window and aisle) and it was only the two of us to sprawl across each other. The cabin crew was/were really good. Spoke good English and didn't seem to be troubled by the usual few fools that adorn every flight! I'd certainly fly Scoot again. Next time to Hong Kong. If I can get a decent Gold Coast to Hong Kong connection. Check-in at the Gold Coast was fast and efficient. Same at Changi. Tip. Take your own Tablet device loaded with your fave TV or Movies. Yep. The battery will expire before the flight lands but by then you will be ready for a few hours of sleep. Also take an empty 500/600ml water bottle on board. Fill it at the water places on the aircraft.,0
Flew with them this week between Bangalore Chandigarh and back to Bangalore. I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. Where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. No smoking announcement not made. Some positives though. Good pricing strategy. Fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve.,1
"I have my flight booked to Riyadh via Mumbai, but the flight delayed for more than 1 and half hour to Mumbai, causing me extra stress for my connecting flight, I hope this does not make me miss the flight to Riyadh, since I have booked direct from IndiGo, if I miss my flight from Mumbai to Riyadh, it is due to their fault and they should compensate or arrange another flight. I hope they do.",1
"Indigo claims that they are an ""on-time departure and arrival"" airlines. This is a joke. I have flown Indigo from Nagpur to Pune for the fifth time this month and yet again this flight was delayed as it always does. This time the delay is more than 5 hours and I am writing this review while waiting for the delayed flight. This particular route's flight always gets delayed and by now Indigo should have taken note and tried to fix the root cause of the issue. How can the same route flight get delayed always? Every single time I have flown from Nagpur to Pune with Indigo, there have been delays. On top of that, there is no refund or alternatives offered for the inconvenience caused due to delays. I could have definitely preferred some other airlines if there were options available for night departures. Unfortunately only Indigo fits into my schedule and I have to choose it for business purpose. I hope Indigo takes note and corrects this issue.",1
"Singapore to Sydney. Scoot should never be allowed to use the description Business to describe the front on the nose seats of their airline. This is clearly no higher than an economy X minus the included food and beverages and service. In fact, apart from some extra leg room and a larger seat, the rest is sub par to most other major airline economy services. The food you pay for and order is below average, no tea coffee or water (after the first small cup) is offered for free. Scoot tv is complicated to get on with an android phone and stops over 1 hour before landing. And Business Class don't even get to disembark the plane before everyone else as the exit door turns out to be behind the front nose section! Just think paying passengers should know they might not bother paying for more than Scoot economy, especially if they're expecting a little Business Class service.",1
"A good flight from Surabaya to Johor Bahru return. No delay at all (arrive earlier). It is better to prebook food, but price onboard is still fair. The aircraft cabin is clean and the cabin crew was so attentive. I got separate seat from Johor to Surabaya, crew know about it and give me permission to change to my family in hot seat (front row). I really appreciate it.",0
I am appalled at Jetstar for not providing me suitable accomodation or an alternative flight. I was flying back home to Sydney from Melbourne. They cancelled my flight due to weather but gave me no more than two hours notice and offered no other options for alternative flights either with themselves or another airline. The staff were very unhelpful. I recommend anyone to pay slightly more for a better airline.,1
"Sibu to Kuala Lumpur. Worst ever airline services on earth. From top to ground level. Arrogant ground staff and arrogance flight attendance. Terrible, terrible, terrible.",1
Traveled on March 25 Sydney to Singapore and have no complaints with our flight at all. Flight left about 10 mins early and arrived into SIN on time. Booked the extra leg room seats up front and the additional cost was worth it. Airline food is airline food when sitting in economy with any airline not to flash.,0
We had to rebook new tickets halfway through our trip due to the booking of flights too close together to make baggage transfer despite paying extra baggage charges and being  told our bags would transfer. A  rude customer service employee at  Kuala Lumpur airport told us it was our fault since if they had told us we did not have enough time then we would have done it anyway.,1
"Once again a cancelled flight. I have written about Jetstar before of how they make me religious, I pray daily I don't have to fly with them. However only direct flight from Perth to Cairns is Jetstar, 3 hours prior to departure they cancel again. Now I must spend hours on the phone trying to get a refund. Their replacement flight only leaves tomorrow and takes 27 hours for a 4 hour trip. Jetstar disgust me. Disgraceful airline. As a Qantas Gold I can say Qantas dropping the ball as well though.",1
"Perth to Bangkok via Singapore. Another very good flight above and beyond the expected standard. Scoot receives a bad press. A recent reviewer on You Tube complains at great length that the airline failed to deliver any of the services it never promised to deliver in the first place, and that it was all but impossible to remove the film covering his meal. I suggest next time this reviewer takes time to check Scoot's terms and conditions, as clearly outlined on the website, and the instructions on the food package. Like the reviewer, I had a choice for my flight. My choice was to fly business class with Scoot for $100 less than a 'full fare; airline charged for a seat in economy. This is cash i would rather have in my back pocket than frittered on pointless trivialities and trinkets I can live without. Taking things as I found them, check-in was rapid - Scoot had a similar number of check in desks open for a 787 as Emirates were prepared to provide for an A380, with consequential length of queue. Boarding was smooth, departure more or less on-time departure with an early arrival in Singapore. Staff were friendly and keen to assist passengers wishing to access the IFE. Food was OK, especially the chocolate, with a wider choice of beer than many other airlines offer. One gripe, though this seems to a common issue with the B787: the passenger cabin was far too cold. However, knowing in advance what was (not) on offer in the way of a blanket, I came prepared with a body warmer. Departure from Singapore on the connection was likewise on time with similar levels of service, my checked bag safely delivered along with myself in Bangkok. Suits me.",0
"Flew Jetstar Airways, Newcastle to Gold Coast return. Both flights on time and cabin crew courteous and efficient. Only had carry on baggage, which I had no problem fitting in. Seat width and pitch is suitable for such a short flight. The lack of ability to select seats for free when online checking in is my only gripe.",0
"I have flown Scoot 20+ times, initially because of price, but then because of aircraft. However, the more you fly them, the more reasons you have to avoid them. It's not the little things like the cabin call buttons positioned so you cannot avoid pressing them by mistake. It's not the inedible food. No, it's the staff. I flew Scoot within a month of their first flight and they were genuinely trying. Now, they have all become SIA wannabes, following the rules with slavish zeal. I don't mind when there is at least the intention to improve my safety. I got used to being told to put my seat upright when still at 40,000ft, etc. And it is just amusing that none of the staff can pronounce ""Let's get outta here"", without it sounding like ""customers go away"". But yesterday, I arrived at DMK airport in Bangkok 56 mins before the departure time to be told, along with a bunch of other disappointed customers, that the check in desk was already closed. No amount of pleading would get the man with the walkie talkie to waver from the script, despite there being plenty of time to clear through. With Bangkok's traffic, I can imagine this is going to happen quite often. This cost me two additional airport taxis, a night in a hotel and a new one-way ticket (with another airline). If I or my luggage don't make a plane, that is my fault, but this case is pure pointless pedantry. I'm sorry Scoot, after using you since the beginning, you have gone too far. I will not be using you again.",1
"One of the worst customer service airlines. Hospitality completely missing from Arrival Desk ( Caunter no8) My handbag is 3 Kg and my luggage is 17kg, both seen by the Desk operator but she charged me 1100 Inr. I said I will shift things in my handbag so she replied that if in the luggage bag 200grm also extra I will charge the you full amount. Might she has family or work pressure? In the profession of hospitality arrogant speaking with wrong body language is not acceptable. It's money making Airline or lack of trainings",1
SIN-MLB night flight. Originally purchased economy ticket and received Jetstar proposal for upgrade for $200. Accepted. Very good flight: on time comfortable good meals nice staff acceptable entertainment. Particularly appreciated noise reduction earphones and inflatable neck supporting pillow in the amenities pack. Have flown three more legs (MLB-SYD SYD-DRW and DRW-SIN) in economy and all flights were OK: on time and with sufficient leg room (I'm quite tall). Overall very positive. Based on this experience and my judgement of frequent flyer (> 700000 miles) highly recommendable.,0
"Osaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. According to 2nd statement on https://www.flyscoot.com/en/customer-service-plan , I should be receiving my refund after 20 business day the latest, yet I received the refund email after 8 weeks had passed and I need to manually request the refund again via email, then I was told I need to wait for another 15 days, this added up to more than 2 months which is equivalent to 64 days, more than the triple of the promised refund period. I was truly disappointed.",1
"First flight cancelled at the gate. No realistic compensation options. Policy is to rebook you on another JS flight or give you money back. Problem is their flights are booked and your only other option is to choose another carrier and pay Twice as much to get where you need to go. Second flight cancelled, same rubbish options offered (nearest jet star flight was 25 hours total flight time to go from Melbourne to Brisbane). Support staff are unable to help due to garbage policies. No compensation given. They kept saying we value getting you to where you need to to but their policies are the exact opposite. Lots of customer care speak, but when push comes to shove they are an incompetent, greedy airline who care very little about you. Lesson learned: never fly Jetstar.",1
"Singapore to Sydney. At the gate we were handed photocopied pages of what was not available on board. By this stage we couldn't buy any food or drink. This was a Scoot flight operated on a Singapore Airlines plane, with a Singapore Airlines crew and flight code. Someone at Scoot thought it cheaper to pay for only the wet lease of the aircraft and not provide any services, drinks, or food. There were no soft drinks for the whole flight. No alcohol. No wifi. No IFE. We were offered a small packet of peanuts and a glass of orange juice for the first five hours. And nothing else. No movies, music or no magazines.  After five and a half hours breakfast was served. Beware if you're tossed onto one of these 'cargo' flights, it's a long flight if you can't sleep, nor watch a movie, nor listen to music, have a snack, soft drink or a beer or glass of wine. Take your own food.",1
"The flight and check in was as expected, dull, nothing flash, adequate attention from check in staff and flight staff. But  I paid a small amount for the flight, so you pay for what you get. However the customer communication was awful, non existent in real terms. I needed to communicate with airasia about an amount they overcharged me. Their website and Airasia super app will only allow you to navigate a set list of questions and set answers. If your issue is outside those parameters, they are not interested. Their website and super app contains no email address or phone number to contact them about any issue out side the answers in the website. You keep getting directed to a ""bot"" called Ava. I managed to find on the internet 2 email addresses belonging to airasia. The response from both of them was ""not our dept, Ticket closed"". When asked which dept I should email, no reply. This issue has been going on 6 months now, it is not resolved. It is very clear that airasia wants nothing to do with ""actual customers"", I cannot comprehend how a company can still exist providing this non existent customer interaction and non existent customer servicing.",1
"I have been having consistent horrible experiences with Indigo regarding delays. I was travelling from Cochin to Bangalore - the flight was supposed to depart at 8.45 pm and it departed the next morning at 2.05 am. A week later, I was returning from Trivandrum to Bangalore - the flight was supposed to depart at 8.15 pm and it departed the next morning at 12.05 am. Today, my wife was supposed to travel to Chennai from Bangalore. The departure time is 7.20 am, the revised departure is at 9:15 am. Indigo used to be consistently punctual. When I speak to the staff, I hear that the fleet is overbooked and you are trying to optimize. I will look at Indigo only as a last option.",1
Delayed more than 3 hours on flight to Bali from Kuala Lumpur on 9 Jan 2014. Although the ground staff knew about the delay in advance they failed to inform the passengers early - not only were we not informed at check in counter but only 1 hour prior scheduled take off time when we were at the gate. The airline changed the flight number causing great confusion and inconvenience for all passengers. No embarkation cards were also given out on board which is a normal procedure with all airlines. Air Asia maybe a budget airline but this does not give it a right to do what they want and as they please. Terrible experience.,1
"What is not wrong with this airline? The staff are not interested, the Seats are too short with no legroom, the food is not suitable for humans. We checked in in Ayers rock, going to Cairns via Melbourne. They where not able to handle our luggage, so we had to take it out in Melbourne. Then we had to wait two hours to check it in to Cairns. With 60 kilo + hand luggage that was a challenge. When we asked, the answer was a totally uninterested company policy. Both the company and the policy stinks. Advise is to avoid them when possible. Fancy colours and uniforms but thats all!",1
"I had got a flight to Sydney from Uluru (Ayers Rock) on the 16th of May 2022 at 2.10pm. However, I had booked in with a 7kg in flight baggage. Having said that, when I checked in at counter, the staff saw my bag and she mentioned nothing as it is below 7kg. As I got onto the flight the crew member stopped me and told me to leave my bag next to her, as it is slightly bigger in size to put it in over the seat bag compartment. I asked, so where will my bag be placed at and she said it'll be placed below the plane, I said ok as long it's safe. She said she'll get it back to me, she asked for my seat number. I waited, she did not come to me to notify me about my bag. Well, I trusted her as a staff and crew member of the flight of Jetstar. Reached Sydney, as I was getting down, I asked her, what happened to my bag, and she said someone from the baggage will page my name for my bag. Well, again I trusted her words and waited at the baggage area, my bag not to be seen, went to check at the Jetstar baggage counter, explained to she and she checked and she gave me a paper with baggage service reference number. I waited more than one hour, looking and waiting for my bag, 2nd I put my trust on the crew member. At last I got a call from the baggage service counter, saying my bag has been sent sent back to the ground at Uluru (Ayers Rock) airport. It is total disgrace to put a passenger in such situation. I had stayed in a hotel having no change of clothes, all were in my bag. I had wasted more than an hour waiting and looking for my bag, caused me stress and anxiety going through all this. I had to go purchase new clothes, new personal items. That bag of mine looked big, but could've easily fit into the cabin bag above the seat. Devastating experience.",1
BKK-HDY-BKK return. Observed significant improvement from cabin crew they seemed to be smiling and really welcomed you on board these flights. Decided to bypass hassle at check-in counter by internet check in pre- printed boarding pass and not loading luggage which is a good decision. The journey become very uneventful compare to the past experience. Aircraft new and clean as usual. Only criticism for buy on board food (evening flight) which all hot food completely sold out what left of sandwiches choices are badly stale.,0
Manila to Legazpi return in August 2018. Both flights were OK. MNL-LGP delayed for about 1 hr was was fine for me and not airline's fault. Return flight was on time. Cebu Pacific is budget airline so everything is buy on-board. Service from both ground and on-air were commendable. All in all I can say the these two flights exceeded my expectations.,0
I specifically ticked no stopovers in my internet choice for flights. The system gave me a return flight with a 2 hour stopover in Cebu and timed out while I was attempting to book the rest of my party and locked me into a 2 hour stopover I did not want! I rang them within the hour to try and get it sorted and they told me they could not rebook and to ring closer to the date and if there were seats available. I called today and they told me they can do it but have to pay an extra $1000.  Ive flown you a few times and Ive been pretty tolerant of your long queues and delays but.. you appear to have regressed instead of progressed and I am beyond disappointed that you are penalising me for your own system errors.,1
Doha to Kochi via Mumbai. I was having least expectation for this early morning flight. But crew on board offered genuine hospitality and big smile. They seems to be attentive and happy to operate this flight. And seating in the forward cabin crew working in the forward cabin did a good job on this flight. I would recommend indigo and would definitely fly with them again.,0
Flew MAA-PNQ (Chennai-Pune). Excellent crew and food service. Seats were terrible and the plane was unclean. One thing I respect about IndiGo is their promptness. The problem with that was that as soon as all passengers had disembarked the next group boarded. Nevertheless the best domestic duty-free I've ever seen.,0
They made me pay $65 for an extra kilogram of carry on luggage when I had paid for check in luggage already. Unacceptable. This is bizarre and Ive never had this with any other airline. Do not recommend them at all.,1
Have flown with AA a few times this time RT from CNX to PEN. On the way from CNX to PEN I had to pay for the first checked baggage twice just because I had a transit in Kuala Lumpur. You will never know where they are going to put you in the airplane unless you pay to choose seat.,1
"I flew from Kalibo heading to Kuala Lumpur via AK609 on 14.25pm - 24 Oct 2017. Before boarding, I caught a fever. I asked for panadol from the crew and they were very responsive providing me with the medicine together with hot water. I had pre-ordered the in-flight meal of coconut rice and they were very kind to offer to help me change to a sandwich in order for me to eat the sandwich before taking the medicine. They came around offering me hot water from time to time. In conclusion, we really enjoyed the personalized service and value for money despite this being a budget airline. The cabin crew were friendly and very helpful.",0
Scoot is now flying the 787 Dreamliner from Sydney to Changi on TZ1. We have come across reviews saying a potable water tap is available in the galley. This is no longer the case. The only drinking water available on the flight is purchased bottled water at 4SGD / 330ml even if you have your own container. Be aware that row 42 has no window at all. Bearing in mind Scoot is a LCC the overall experience was excellent (for the price).,0
"Horrible customer service. Flight was rescheduled and delayed by two hours which missed our connecting flight. Told by sms at 9am for a rescheduled departure at 5pm. One hour on WhatsApp chat trying to rearrange the connecting flight (booked in the same ticket). Continuously got the same Message, contact ground staff when arriving in Singapore in the evening. No care, just we will do better in the future. The problem was today and not helping when talking about the future! What customer service is this?",1
"Melbourne to Christchurch. The cancellation of a Jetstar flight resulted in the cancellation of all family trips which we planned half a year ago. The notice was sent to us just 5 hours before the airport check-in. The closest flight that Jetstar offered is 4 days later. That, of course, wouldn't fit my schedule as all the hotel I booked are full. The reason for cancellation given by Jetstar is crewing requirement. When I ask Jetstar staff what does that mean she said she doesnt actually know what that means. There is no compensation plan and passengers had to pay all cancellation fees for precooked hotels and activities.",1
MNL-CGY-CEB-CGY. Wesbite was good though had some issues with it they accepted our Master Card. Check-In took forever because there were 11 of us; however; check-in agent was friendly and helpful. Terminal 3 is excellent leaps and bounds better than T1. Boarding was chaotic as ever on an A320. Seats comfy cabin was new and clean. Legroom was awful. FAs were unfriendly and robotic no smiles at all. Good BOB options good prices. Though a complimentary drink would be nice. CGY-CEB-CGY on a smaller ATR-72 both flights were uneventful. Both flights were departed and arrived nearly 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin were once again spotlessly clean FAs same we had the same FA on both legs sort of friendly. Had some games which was appreciated. Overall Cebu Pacific is a true lowcost carrier. I would use PR next time for more class and comfort.,0
"Lombok to Bali. This airline is always late! I have missed connections because of them. After flying with them throughout my whole trip to Indonesia (big mistake), my last flight was finally on time. Unfortunately, they damaged my surfboard on that flight and refused to pay. Actually, they said if I stay in the country for another month, they would repair it for me. Ridiculous! The staff was so confused and had no idea how to handle the situation. After 3 hours of negotiating, my friend got his board repaired. They still refused to repair mine.",1
Flew Darwin to Singapore my first time flying Jetstar. Plane is an Airbus 320 leaves Darwin just after 6am. Check-in was fine no delays. Able to use Qantas Club before boarding though QC at Darwin currently being renovated so food limited and no coffee. Comfort on plane ok better than I thought used $10 voucher to purchase sandwich and bottle of water. Chicken sandwich awful flight made up half an hour staff fine. I'm afraid I prefer full service and have everything included plus decent food. Fare was $200 return including QF points and voucher.,1
Ayers Rock to Sydney. Flight was delayed by four hours. We werent kept up to date with an accurate time of departure. The flight was almost the same price as Virgin. Overall a very poor experience.,1
The seat was cramped but apart from that the leather seat was reasonably comfy. I flew from Darwin to Melbourne and the staff were pretty. You get what you paid for. The flights were cheap so there was no entertainment food or drinks provided.,1
"Flew Denpasar to Melbourne on the Boeing 787 and I have to say that the experience was unsatisfying, if not to say miserable. It did not feel like a normal flight on another aircraft type, but it instead felt much worse than that. We already had a 30mins delay waiting for pushback from Bali's Ngurah Rai airport, for a reason the pilot did not even announce. Additionally it was a red-eye flight, which means that sleep is important on such flight. However this is the least duration of sleep I could ever get on a red eye flight which will be explained further below. Mood lighting was there but not effective at all. The IFE was there with a responsive touchscreen, although money is required to pay for most of the IFE content. Seats were horrible. Leather seats are not at all comfortable, inhibits sleep, as well as those hard headrests that felt very weird to adjust. Seat itself was very narrow at less than 17 inches, and armrest was ridiculously narrow not a hand can comfortably rest on them. The seat pitch was also very narrow at what felt like 30 inches, extremely cramped, and all these contributed to my sleeplessness. What's more the plane was scorching hot, so more than an hour of sleep seems like an incredible feat to do on such a plane. Meal was bland, only the sauce had a slight bit of flavour, although the dessert made up for the bad food. Cabin crew were average with nothing remarkable to speak of. The same can be said on the return flight. Hot plane, narrow seats, bland food but with great deserts, average crew, same IFE. Unfortunately the return flight was much worse, the humidity was causing my runny noise for about an hour. Shades were not able to block light fully.  I cannot recommend longhaul flying with the 787 as well as with Jetstar.",1
Given their fares are about half that of the cheapest competitors with all possible add-ons I don't think one can really complain about the fees for checked baggage iPads or meals. The food was nothing amazing but the staff were great and helpful. 10-across B777-2 is not exactly comfortable but it is bearable for an 8 hour flight to Australia and definitely worth the price. The iPads are well loaded and easy to use would definitely recommend getting one if you're not going to sleep aboard. All in all given their an LCC and their prices are so low you certainly get a lot for what you paid for.,0
"I was supposed to fly out yesterday on JQ37 unfortunately they cancelled the flight due to ""engineering requirements"". They didn't let me know in advance I didn't find out until I was dropping my bag in. I was given the option of trying again in 24 hours or take a refund and try another airline. Being late in the afternoon I had no other option but to cancel my trip. I wouldn't fly with Jetstar. I would strongly discourage anyone from flying with them if punctuality is important to you. It surprises me they are three stars. Frankly for no showing of flights they should barely be one star.",1
Need to focus on customer service and not all the fine print in terms and conditions. Show service and empathy Jetstar.,1
"Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. We had 4 flights booked and paid together but could not sit together unless we paid additional fees at check in to get seats changed. This is a revenue raising exercise. In addition to that the staff were very rude to me and appear to go out of their way to be unhelpful. In flight service is not existent, flights with not even a free drink without incurring additional costs. Aircraft very cramped spaces, not comfortable.",1
Gold Coast to Sydney. The worst trip I have ever taken. Plane sat on the runway for 2 hours. Customer service was limited and rude. No water offered or anything. This is why you are better off flying a better airline as it will cost less in the long run.,1
"Really reliable and warm Service. I went to singapore by Scoot and when I arrived at the airport, I realized that I left my Iphone in my seat pocket. I saw the Cabin Crews and Captain Pilot just went out from the plane and I explain to him what happened. Captain Kelvin was helping me to get my Iphone back. Scoot Cabin Crew for the next flight passed me my Iphone after Captain Kelvin asking his colleagues to help me. Thank You so much Captain. Not because of the phone price, but the data inside is very important to my next big project. Me and My Family Thank you so so muchh for your kindness and willing to spend your time to help us.  The Journey was smooth, the cabin crews very kind and helpful. Clean and quite spacious for budget airlines. Much better than other budget airlines.",0
My first domestic trip CNX-DMK return. Was pleased to see what they had done with DMK. Disappointed that we were bussed to terminal but as it dropped us off nearer baggage area without walking far we shouldn't grumble. Efficient boarding at both ends meant early arrival on both sectors. Had the pancake combo for breakfast. Surprised that the drink offered was water and not coffee. I only used them as a friend arrived at DMK also with Air Asia. Price was almost same as Bangkok Airways to BKK and will continue to use them if flying to BKK and beyond. But TAA and DMK is an attractive alternative if just flying to BKK.,0
"Denpasar to Melbourne. This will be the last time I fly with Jetstar outside Australia. We waited in a line for 2.5hrs with our 6 month old, poor communication, no water offered while waiting, overnight accomodation was tacky to say the least! $30 food voucher for the day, what a joke, see what you get for that on their flights a drink and a packet of chips! Jetstar if you not up to delivering a service, then pull out of the business. What a distasteful end to what was a beautiful holiday.",1
Sydney to Adelaide with Jetstar Airways. Will never fly them again! At 8am they cancelled their 3.30pm service to Adelaide and they said all the other flights are full. For a technical reason they should be able to put on another aircraft. I missed out on attending a very important that night! Ill use Virgin in future.,1
"Sydney to Hobart. I had booked with confidence as this is a Qantas subsidiary. Arrived at the counter and one has to check in and also tag their own bags. I had no problem once I was able to find a working kiosk and one that was available. The lines were unbelievably long due to most people having no idea how to check in at the kiosk and were dumbfounded with the bag tag. It was mass chaos and no one from JetStar assisting in any way. I had done my research and paid for my extra baggage and carry-ons before arrival. By the time you pay for the extras, believe me, I spent much more than if I just flew Qantas or Virgin. But Jetstar had the flight schedule I needed. Arrived at the gate, weighed my carry-on and the customer service rep tagged my bag. We sat there and sat there. No plane, no announcements. Then about 200 other passengers descended upon our gate. Something was up. No gate agents at the desk. Finally an announcement of a gate change. I move to the new gate. There is a plane. We sit for another 30 minutes, I'm suspect there is a problem as we are scheduled to fly an A321 and an A320 is at the gate, which will not accommodate all the passengers. Suddenly, I watch all of the gate agents pack up and leave. No announcement, nothing. They just walk away and disappear. Again, I get up and walk over to the departures board and see that again we have a new gate. I go back and announce it to those of us sitting at a gate. We all move to the new gate per the board. An announcement was never made of the gate change and passengers were running all over the place, confused, furious - mass chaos. Finally we board. I'm sitting in the first row 1A, extra room seat and I paid the premium for it. I notice that I'm sitting in a wet seat and the carpeting is soaked and squishy. The cabin manager, who is professional, gregarious and superlative in customer service briefs us on operating the emergency exit and then we sit and wait. We sit and we sit. The PA of the plane is not working. The cabin crew notices the water and the wet carpet. Mechanics determine that due to the heavy rains, someone left the door open and the water affected the electrics of the PA system. We sit as they try to fix it. Of course the plane is taken out of service, and our cabin crew is now illegal and we disembark. We gather again in the gate, and remarkably a new plane was promised and delivered. At this point, the gate agents were finally competent and doing their jobs. I have to say I found the cabin crews to be excellent and I felt very safe flying Jet Star. The hassle one experiences at the gate is absurd to say the least. Flying is bad enough on a full service carrier, so why torture yourself with JetStar. The check-in process is ridiculous and something I'll never forget.",1
Flight good however the delivery of food service was very poor. Running back and forth with individual food and drink for passengers is such a waste of time. This cannot be difficult to achieve as other budget airlines seem to have a smooth flow of service even at a basic level. Also the quality of product available should be reviewed. Happy to pay a little more. However I will travel Scoot again. With these adjustments more profit and potentially a good product in a competitive market.,0
"The long and short of the ""Cebu Pacific Experience"" can be summed up into: 1) Massive delays 2) Rude and improperly trained staff and 3) Poor ground baggage claim service. This low cost carrier's delays used to be just their main problem during the previous years I've flown them. However, flight comfort, very poor in-flight staff training and their system for baggage claim in my most recent flight leads me to make this my last ever booking with them. The HKG-MNL flight I was on left almost an hour late. The flight attendants were very rude and did not offer any help to assist my friend whose legroom was taken by a bag that was placed by the passenger in front of him under the seat, nor did they offer any help to fix the situation to make both my 6'1 tall friend's legroom and putting the front passenger's bag in an overhead storage. As we arrived close to 40 minutes late in Manila, we aired our concern to the lead flight attendant after all passengers left only to be rudely said that it was (having my 6'1 friends legroom reduced by a blocking bag) as a very small deal. After apologies were finally made, we were then greeted by yet another 30-40 minute delay in our baggage claim. If the 25-75 dollar addition is not a big deal, I would really advise you avoid this airline than having one (or all in my case) of these deplorable instances happening to you. The saving that you get is, in my opinion and by many others I've read here, not worth the stress.",1
They cancel the flight schedule and gave me other day. I tried to contact AirAsia but cannot connect. The live chat was useless.  This my first time and last time using AirAsia.,1
"Never have I come across a more arrogant, rude and hopeless team of staff. The quicker these people are replaced by robots or are trained in customer service, the better. What an appalling experience. In no other industry, that has been affected by a pandemic, would you get away with being so rude to customers.",1
SYD-MEL return into Avalon and out of Tullamarine. Jetstar do what they say on the box. I didn't expect a full service IFE or the best legroom on an A320. I hoped for on-time performance no cancellations a professional crew and they delivered. First flight was punctual the second experienced a weather-related delay that was handled well both before and during the flight with regular announcements. For the fare I was very satisfied and would use JQ again.,0
Travelled KCH-KUL with AirAsia and KUL-ICN with AirAsiaX (Fly-thru). Happy with their efficient and no-nonsense service. Baggage went all the way from KCH to ICN. Flight departed on time (as with most other flights I have taken with AirAsia). In-flight magazine was quite an interesting and informative read. Pleased with the courtesy of the crew. Also the Captain greeted disembarking passengers which is excellent.,0
Flew three sectors in total with AirAsia. Booked online and checked in online well in advance. We were not seated together but expected to pay a fee to be seated together for two of the sectors. I booked 30 kgs of baggage as there is no free allowance for all three sectors but they only allowed me 20 kgs and wanted extra excess baggage fee. Their scales at KBV registered 5kgs more than the scales at DMG. Seat pitch bad which resulted in bruised knees when the pax in front recline his seat hard. Stewardess stated he had a right to do so but did not how I was feeling. Safety onboard poor with no one seated at the emergency exits as thes are added value seats. Money before safety. Third sector was late departing but no apology. There are cheaper alternatives if you look around. I am a regular flyer and this was possibly one of the worst experiences.,1
Travelled with family on KL-Chiang Mai and thoroughly enjoyed the smooth and on-time flights. The pre-booked meals were ok and the crews service was well above average to my surprise. Entertainment - not applicable.,0
"I originally intended to give IndiGo a good revues, as I've been travelling India for 2 months and their service was fine for the most part. However, in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and I felt compelled to warn other travellers. Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport. It's now been 3 days, my bag is still in Delhi and IndiGo have no idea what's going on. They don't even know the right number to call at Delhi Airport to get an update. At the end of the day, fly IndiGo if you want a cheap flight and can count on things going according to plan, but don't expect any support if there are any disruptions as they don't appear to have the customer's best interests at heart.",1
I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs. Moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them.,1
"Booking for onward flights were correct, there was enough time to connect in Manila. Then the airline issued a ticket under i0ne booking number and mention connection guaranteed by carrier. Booking for return flight did not alert on any issue for connection. The connecting tine (1 hour and 20 minutes) was too short for immigration formalities and taxi to next place for connecting flight. I tried to reach customer service. After hours waiting for agent i got a brief message: the company had issued 2 booking codes (one for each segment of the itinerary) so it could not guarantee the connection. I had to buy another ticket for the connecting flight, 3 hours later, to be sure I would have time to go through immigration and to take a taxi to go to departure place for connecting flight. AirAsia should not show connecting flights with too short time to connect. It should show flights with at least 3 hours for connection, or it should inform client, when booking a Bangkok to Cebu flight that client will need at least 3 hours for immigration plus transport to second place for connecting flight. It is unfair to let client book and pay flight with insufficient connecting time and then tell client ""Sorry there is nothing we can do, yes you are likely to miss the connecting flight, you should buy a new ticket for a later flight"".",1
"Kuching to Penang. This is what I love about budget airline. Even though you just pay a little amount of money, sometimes you will be getting a lot more. I even get aircraft miniature in my flight. Plus, all the staff are good looking and very neat.",0
"Flew Scoot from Taipei to Tokyo. I thought since this is a cheap airline, the service would be horrible. However, it's not the case at all. I was lucky to have pre-selected my seat and paid a fee to sit in the silent zone. There were actually parents with small children taking the same flight (leaving 6.40am) I was shocked. What are the parents thinking?? I highly recommend the passengers to pay for the silent zone seats if you are annoyed by screaming kids easily. In general, a pleasant experience.",0
"Upon reaching the check in counter, I was asked to pay 6700 php for over buggage. They considered my laptop with charging brick as excess baggage. I previously came from Qatar to the Philippines with the same bag and they did not even weigh the bag after i told them it was my laptop. It was initially 9k php according to the lady a Filipina who was rude, and I dont know but the lady changed it to 6700php. Upon reaching the plane, there was no food unless you pay for it. The flight was more than 4 hours due to delays and many were really hungry on this flight. They did not even provide water. I will never use this airline again. Not worth it.",1
November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.,1
"Delhi (DEL) - Kolkata (CCU) 6 Nov 14 6E219 - Was traveling with a small trolley bag (15"" diagonally) and a compact laptop bag (15"" diagonally). Total weight 11 kgs. Got the shock of my life when they said that they wouldn't allow more than 7 Kgs in cabin including laptop. Now I had a laptop and charger. Then I had a SLR Camera with lenses plus a change of clothes and some files. They asked me to pack all the fragile items into one bag and check-in the other. Imagine my situation. There was no way I could fit all the fragile items into one bag and weigh in at less than 7 kgs. I checked-in the bag and nothing was damaged. On to other aspects of the flight. The seats are cramped and the seat back is very thin. You feel the knees of the guy behind you! The food they sell is mediocre. If you want on time performance then probably this LCC is the best in India. But if you want customer friendly service comfortable seats good food or in-flight entertainment (none exists on Indigo aircraft's) or for that matter a reasonable cabin baggage policy then do look elsewhere.",1
Horrible Experience. Flight got delayed 2 hours with 2 very rude and unprofessional cabin crews that is finding faults unnecessary and made wrongly accusation. Will never choose this airline.,1
"We have been trying to get out of Gili island for a couple of days. Due to the volcanic activity all flights were cancelled. We called Lombok and Lion Air informed that one or two flights were operational so head there to find out it was fake. We take a boat from Lombok to Bali and reach the Lion Air counter at 2am. We waited at the desk until someone asked us to not sit at their counter(although lots of other flight counters had no problem with the same) we get out and return to the counter at 5 for cancelling our ticket and issuing new ones for which we were charged an exorbitant amount. 8 million rp! Being extremely tired, we agree. One of the payments didn't process on the credit card so we went to their Lion Air customer service. They fleeced us there too with bad exchange rates. Post that we go in and since one from three tickets was yet to be cancelled and reissued we did that at the machine. The cancellation for which was less than 5 million! And now the flight is delayed. Not surprised. Never taking this airline again. We have met amazing people in Indonesia who gave us the best service except Lion Air.",1
Townsville to Brisbane. Ive flown all over the world and have never had such bad customer service. Lady at the counter was not helpful or willing to assist me in any way. If you fly with them make sure you leave plenty of time or they wont let you check baggage and get on the plane!!! Wont be using them again!,1
"Worst experience ever. I wanted to drop luggage at Cairns airport. I was asked by Jetstar check-in staff to queue at the only member to take bags. At that moment, no one else queued behind us. A few moments later, some passengers started to queue behind. This popped up more Jetstar staff to take bags. However, one of them asked me to go back to the end of the now swelling queue. She didn't care to listen to my explanation! Worst airline I experienced!",1
Sydney to Singapore last August. Sydney ground staff were really good except for one. The seats were like concrete after a few hours. Taking the Kindle was a great idea. No inflight entertainment except at added expense. The food that passengers ordered at extra cost looked quite palatable. Cabin staff were really nice. Seats are a bit narrow. Leg room is constricted. Take a snack from the post customs food shops to get you to Singapore. If traveling on from Singapore allow time for possible delays. Changi Airport is user friendly. Free internet. Bus tours of the city. Movie areas for the kids. All of the International fast food outlets.,0
Flew from Singapore to Sydney in Oct. Had early check-in which was very good as had 6 hour stay in Singapore. Very efficient staff at airport very helpful. Flight wise very good minor delay but a good flight. My only concern is that when purchasing food or drink on board unless you give correct money you don't get any change! So future traveller be warned.,0
"Flew Singapore to Jakarta. 1) The way that Scoot is making money is ridiculous, after check in, there are staff who go around checking the weight of cabin luggage and purposely look for an extra kilogram and demand payment for it. Poor man behind me was forced to pay for his extra 1 kg! 2) Entry to aircraft - a passenger with a wheelchair was treated as a second class passenger as nobody was assisting. 3) Dirty and oily seats, magazines, all around you was just not hygienic.",1
"Lion Air flight Surabaya to Banjarmasin. The flight was delayed but not even a single announcement was made by the airline. The flight was suppose to depart at 1320 but only at 1340 an announcement was made for passengers to be at the departure gate. We departed in heavy rain but it was a good take-off. The plane was a bit heavily used, it can be seen for the condition of the seat and surrounding area. There was sale of food and beverages but the choices were too little.",0
"Singapore to Jakarta. I was supposed to board on 20.40 pm and got delayed until 00.50. I'm writing this while waiting and still hasn't boarded. A very bad airline and service. No one told me if it got delayed I have to asked the information desk each time it got delayed, again and again and again. There is no compensation given as well nor any apology said from the airline. I don't recommend ever taking this aircraft.",1
"Auckland to Melbourne. I don't think I've ever been on time with a Jetstar flight. There is always something that has caused them to have a delay. Its just how much you are delayed by each time. The $30 I have saved by going with this airline is not worth it. This flight was a late night flight which will cause me to arrive in the early early AM. Very seriously do not recommend, none of my friends or family fly with them for the same reasons now. They were rated the most on time airline at one point. Did they do their own ratings or something, because that must be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.",1
"Osaka to Cairns. Firstly I have to say that having the entertainment system blankets and drinking water as an option for an additional charge appears to be a really bad service since long range flights over 4h are expected to include those features in the price. Flying from KIX to CNS on a Boeing 787 was just another less than average service. Having pre-booked the entertainment package ($10) and a meal($10) to make sure that this flight remains a chance to be somewhat 'okay' still turned out as not being enough. My screen was frozen about 1:10h after starting to watch a movie. After it automatically rebooted, the system asked me to pay for the use of the entertainment system, so I contacted a crew member and asked if they could fix that issue. Even during the remaining 5+ hours they weren't able to make it work - wasted money (rip-off). Second flight, same day, CNS-BNE, A320: Pre-purchased a meal when I booked that flight and expected to have it served before other customers who still have to pay for whatever they order on the plane. This wasn't the case either. Instead it took that long, that landing was only 30 minutes away on a 2h flight.",1
"Delhi to Jaipur. Catastrophic reservation system and customer cervice I have booked a fully flexible return ticket online (via iPhone) on Jan 1st 2019, for departure in early Feb'19. The booking process is extremely cumbersome, also it seems to be mandatory to pay for every single aisle seat on this airline. All payment options for international passengers incur convenience fees which is extremely annoying. On Jan 3rd, needed to change the return flight. Tried to do so online but in vain, the online portal just returned cryptic error messages. Sent an Email to Customer Service asking for advise to change flights as its not possible online. Promptly, on Jan 4th received a response which was completely unrelated and misleading, incl the proposal to contact their domestic call center for further help. Went down to their local agent & explained the issue. Nevertheless they talked me though the online process again. When I was about to leave their office I was told that online modifications only work using the Google Chrome browser. Just cancelled the entire booking and won't consider IndiGo ever again even without ever flying with them. What a terrible airline.",1
"Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. Tried to upgrade my seat from Economy to Business. Upgrading via the site gave me errors. Called the phone numbers on their app (2 in Vietnam) both wrong numbers. Found the correct numbers eventually - phone went to the hold music and hung up after 10 mina, twice. Went to the airport early to upgrade, Jetstar staff told me to wait for check in to open and do it at the counter. Went to counter and they said I had to do it before check in opened and it's too late now - and it was the same guy that told me to wait. The kicker though, he grinned at me. Crew on board just chatted to each other and were barely seen. In addition: 5 flights with Jetstar equals 33 emails, 4 flight changes, 17 SMS's, different contact number for each email, emails to check in for flights they cancelled.",1
Travelling from Mumbai (Terminal 1) to Chandigarh had the worst experience and poorest customer service. No information was provided on the ticket about Online check-in process. Myself along with my old parents and a 5 year old was informed at the counter about online check in process or else were supposed to pay 200rs each to get a boarding pass at the counter  I finally ended calling my brother who did that for us. I went with my boarding passes to the Counter and agent stating baggage was overweight 4 kgs and charging 2100rs for this. We were told that either we can take our luggage back or has to pay.,1
Padang-Jakarta sector - airline seems more like a shuttle. No food was provided  but the ubiquitous water cup which you get on every public transport in Indonesia.,1
"Bali to Jakarta. I will never fly this airline again. True to form Lion Air managed to be delayed both departing Jakarta for Bali, and returning. Not only were they delayed but there were last minute gate changes, in both directions, that had I not been keeping a close eye on we'd have missed the flight. For the return flight I received a text message, the day before departure, informing me that departure would no longer be 19.30, but 21.15. On arrival at the airport, after questioning Lion Air staff, I was told the flight was delayed by another two hours. When I mentioned compensation I was told we'd get a snack after a two-hour delay, a meal after a three-hour delay, and after four hours compensation of 300,000 IDR per person (+/- 20 USD). I thought he'd left a zero off the end. The flight finally took off at midnight. That means for a flight of 1.5 hours' duration, we were delayed 4.5 hours.",1
Flew lately with them from KUL to PEN and I loved the airline. I also pre-ordered their in-flight meal service which was delicious and promptly delivered once on board. On return flight the flight was delayed by 2 hrs. but I needed to be back in KUL on time so I booked another airline on my way back to KUL. Later I exchanged a few e- mails with their station manager in PEN so they handled my delay costs very professionally. All in all not a bad airline to fly with around Asia. Only negative side is that they use low-cost terminal at KUL which you can not compare with a satellite Terminal.,0
"This is not the first time that Jetstar shows its badly customer service. The boarding pass says that the boarding starts at 10:05. At 10:03, while Im waiting on the line to have my bag checked, the screens started showing FINAL CALL for my flight. My cousin was stopped by the security to check his bag, while I ran to the gate. I arrived there at 10:09 (only 4min after the boarding supposedly started), and the attendants were already pressuring me to enter the flight so they could close the doors and leave my cousin behind. 4 minutes of difference and they push me to leave my cousin behind, completely inhuman behavior. If you can, avoid flying with them.",1
Melbourne to Hobart. Flight was 2 hours late and then left us at the luggage carousel for 45 min waiting for luggage to be unloaded a completely unacceptable performance that caused us to miss the wedding we travelled for and incur additional transport costs. Information flow throughout was poor and inaccurate.,1
Charged me $65 for 1 extra kg. I've been flying my whole life and never have I been charged for 1 extra kg. No sympathy for the clients. No flexibility. Absolutely ridiculous. Never flying Jetstar again.,1
"Received a notification that my flight to KL is cancelled. However I have another domestic flight from KL to Kota Baru so I wanted that they cancel the other flight as well (cause if I cancel myself refund would be different) and they refund me instead of a credit note. Have called India call center - useless - there is no number for flights outside Asia, chat bot is a machine that doesn't understand any of the specificities of my case of course, customer service just doesn't exist, facebook account has no-one on the other end either, no customer service person on linked. I am appalled and shall never use that airline again if they don't refund me.",1
Travelled PER-SIN-PER in Biz class selection. This was disappointing to say the least. Had previously travelled in economy seats (standard blue) and actually found no difference in service or comfort. Waste of money paying the extra for Bizclass. The entertainment streaming was unavailable on our flight which made the 5 hour journey seem quite long and tiring. The return flight was delayed 4 hours which totally interfered with our plans and cost us dearly for additional airport drinks and long term parking. We were bussed along with all other passengers to the plane which was still being repaired when we boarded.,1
"Jakarta to Berlin via Singapore. On the website it says that it includes a large suitcase (in general) and then that in economic it includes two handbags (I think I remember well). In addition it puts several options of weight: 1 without weight, 2 20 kg (don't remember ), 3 25 kg (don't remember ), etc. Which let me to think that if I carried 15 kg of checked luggage I didn't have to pay, and in fact, I had finally to pay 100.  This comment may not show what I try to explain, but if you see it on the website it will be understood. In addition, paying food were shown on the website, and I also thought it would be an extra, because of course, paying your 12h flight ticket, how could it be so they do not give you a minimum of food and drink?",1
"My Scoot flight from Melbourne to Singapore was originally supposed to fly around 12pm but the night before our flight the airline e-mailed me that my flight has been rescheduled to depart around 9pm and land at 1am, but our flight landed around 2am. We have been waiting nearly for an hour to check in as the queue was extremely long. The aircraft was clean, nice legroom and a comfortable seat. Good Wi-fi connectivity, nice merchandisers and adequate staff service. Poor F&B because they gave us the wrong order and we were not allowed to choose our drinks so they gave us coke. As we touched down in Singapore, I went to the conveyor belt and found that the wheel of my Rimowa broke. We immediately went to the lost and found and the staff said that it's Scoot's policy that they are not responsible for any damage. Overall the service is good but the time management and the handling is poor.",0
"The customer service at the counter is the worst. I had to pay for a weight upgrade when I was carrying the exact same weight and bags that I did a week earlier in Sydney, where I was not charged for it. The airline only cares to take as much money as possible from you. I was suggested that in order to take my combined weight down I put on as much of my clothes as possible, which was humiliating as people who saw me doing so laugh at me. And even after going through that upsetting experience it wasnt enough, and I was then told that the could allowed up to 7.9 kg. My only two options by then were to try wearing the suitcase, which in is own weights 4 kg, or pay the $65 upgrade. They didnt even send my bag to the AFT deck. I paid that money to take the carry-on luggage with me. Whats the point to pay them?",1
"Singapore to Phuket. The trip went smooth, on time in both ends, friendly staff both in Singapore and onboard the plane. Very positive experience. We do not expect that, when it comes to LCC.",0
I've flown a few times - mainly between MNL DVO and CEB. Most times I've booked the flights from Australia and had no issues with the website or pricing. Airport experience does tend to be somewhat chaotic but onboard experience is fine. Comfortable and clean aircraft with cheerful crews. Since they're basically all short haul flights I don't mind about food or amenities.,0
Gold Coast to Singapore return. Good efficient check-in friendly staff. Flight on time seating fine if you are short but if you are over 6ft would recommend buying Super Seats. Haven't tried there food it is expensive compared to Air Asia water is expensive but you can take your empty water bottle onboard and fill it up. Flight from Singapore also on time and efficient boarding. I purchased the Ipad and had two good movies. Overall for a Budget Airline I think they are very good.,0
"I was at the bag drop, they verified everything and then ask to go to a different counter, this happened for an hour and I missed my flight. They didn't compensate me for this and I had to buy a ticket at a higher price. The staff were not helping in any way",1
"Singapore to Bali. I am so unsatisfied with Scoot, I decided I shall warn anyone who is considering booking. We booked Singapore to Bali, and each bought 1 check-in luggage with the ticket. But we ended up having one extra luggage, instead of charging us one extra luggage fee, they requested us to pay for $20SGD per KG for excess weight , which equivalent to total of $400SGD for one extra luggage. On our return flight, SIN to Taiwan, we experience very bad customer service with the ground crew who were giving us attitudes. The seats on the plane were extremely small, Im only 5 tall and my feet was already touching the back of the seat in front of me. I had a snack which I bought in the airport , and was told to stop eating because the airline does not permit any outside food and no water was offered on the flight. This is less than a budget airline! If you are connecting in Singapore, Scoot is actually a poor choice because it does not have a transfer/connecting counter inside terminal, which means you have to exit the terminal of arrival, goes through custom, collect your luggage and then check in again! You will  miss your flight if there is not 3 hours connecting time. Whereas other airlines have connecting counter inside terminal and you can easily transfer and check in. Anyways, this is my last time flying Scoot, never experienced such a bad service!",1
"There should be a body to review how Cebu Pacific do business online it's not much short of fraud. Almost every time I book on line the ultimate response is ""cannot process your card"" and every time you try again the price increases. In November I was booked on a Tiger flight from Clark Philippines to Singapore take off at 12.20. Tiger cancelled at 11.00am and accepted no responsibility for this. The Cebu Pacific flight taking off at 12.10 was only half full and put their price up immediately from 3950 pesos to 15000 pesos. Am I the only one who thinks this sort of practice is criminal?",1
We had a flight on 6:15 pm today from Dhaka to Chennai. We took boarding at 3pm and waited in the lounge. We were 5 persons waiting. But somehow forgot to check the timings. We reached at the gate at 6pm. It was still at the boarding gate  but indigo refused to take us as they have closed the gate 5 minutes before our arrival. They could have easily take us because they left the boarding bridge 15 minutes after we have arrived.,1
"Tokyo to Brisbane via Cairns. You may be able to get cheap flights but then they cancel them on you. We bought return flights to Japan They cancelled our return flight and we had to book an extra night at the hotel and then 2 days before we were due to fly back they cancelled it again. They never gave us any options for the date we were supposed to return or the next day so I got on line and booked the very next day but had to fly via Osaka. Flights cost $1200 they refunded $350 and we had to pay another $2000 to get home. Jetstar insurance wouldn't help us either. Worst company ever and we had to pay for food, entertainment everything that is free on other international flights.",1
I had a case dropped onto my head from the overhead baggage compartment by a steward. I bit my tongue and got swelling on my head. Very apologetic and I was offered a drink of water and an icepack however no follow up. I am a senior citizen and this could have caused serious injury.,1
Flew from Singapore to KL. Great flight aircraft was clean and very comfortable. Plane left on time and arrived early at destination. Flight crew was very pleasant and helpful. I was very happy with the flight and had a great experience.,0
"Honeymoon ruined and a huge expense incurred by this incompetent, unprofessional airline! We were flying from Sibolga to Medan where we had a connecting flight with another airline but a dog got on the runway at takeoff. So we had to wait over 5 hours until we could take off so we  missed our connecting flight. I asked the staff at lion air to help us but they were totally unsympathetic and refusing responsibility and we had to buy replacement flights with Garuda air instead. I understand that I have rights as a consumer in Indonesia and was at least supposed to get some money for the inconvenience of delay, but we got nothing but scowls and lies. They lied about the delay and as it got worse and worse.",1
"Terrible experience! Flight cancelled the night before. Staff at Airport didn't want to help us, we asked for a refund. Don't fly with them the customer service is completely unfair.",1
"Hong Kong to Hanoi, supposed to be a short 2 hr flight but its already been delayed 2 hrs and its estimated that itll be 3 hours. The worst part is that didnt inform anyone for a very long time so were all waiting around. There wasnt even anyone at the gate desk for over an hr after the delay. Then we get switched gates and the girls that finally show up at the desk are pretty much just on their phones even when you walk up. Pretty much killed a day in my short stay in Hanoi. Wont fly them again.",1
I have flown Jetstar a number of times over the last few months most recently to Cairns and return.. Their planes are new and clean and I find the staff overall very good. All flights I have been on have been on time. They have now become my domestic airline of choice.,0
"Checked in with a friend for Jetstar flight JQ984 from Adelaide to Perth at a self check-in kiosk at Adelaide airport. Hundreds of people were queued at the Jetstar service desk due to a cancelled Adelaide to Melbourne flight. No sooner were our boarding passes and baggage tags issued, the flight was cancelled (operational reasons) and the only option given for another Jetstar flight to Perth was 3 days later. We chose to get a refund and booked another flight on Qantas. However, the only way to get home that day was to fly via Canberra and pay an additional $3000 for 2 economy seats, which we did! The Canberra to Perth sector on Qantas was delayed and nearly cancelled too! Never again will we be flying Jetstar.",1
"Bangkok to Kansai. Due to the fact that I was in a tour group, I couldnt choose the airline I was flying. I wanted to fly Thai Airways, however that wasnt possible. On a timeline scale, I reserved an extra ticket for my Mum in business, as it was on sale at the time. It was only $200 on the first sector, so we brought it. It would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. Initially, I asked for an exit row, and got the best seat, 4J and 4H. However, the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. Once I got on board, the flight attendant at the door greets you,  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. I call the purser, and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. They then say that this was a double seat assignment and that I had to sit in row 15. The seat itself isnt appealing, and some short haul aircraft have better seats. I couldve paid extra for seats with extra legroom, but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in, and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. Luckily, the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. But the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse! The most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call button/light switch, awkwardly placed on the armrest. I understand the 787 doesnt have call buttons on the ceiling, but cant you find a better place for it? After takeoff, I order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. The lasagne tasted unappetising, while the pasta tasted really bland. A little bit later in the flight, I had Ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. All this food set me back 50 Singaporean dollars. The equivalent amount of food on AirAsia would only cost me a third as much, and also tastes better.  On the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, the staff at the check in were friendly like Japanese people are, and I requested an extra legroom seat, and found out I wouldnt be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. However, my brother wasnt allowed to sit there, so we asked if he was allowed to sit in The ScootInSilence zone, which he wasnt allowed to, even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. There was a lady and her daughter talking in Japanese in the counter next to us, and later in the flight, I saw her and her daughter (who looked like she was 10) sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if I had a language barrier, even though the guy at the counter wasnt Japanese. The crew on this flight were much more friendly, but still considerably cold. I went to have some conversation in the galley, and after 2 minutes of pleasant conversation they all had their backs turned on me. Scoot is a horrible choice and I would pay much more in order to be able to avoid it. Not worth the $500 I paid round trip.",1
"Brisbane to Phuket via Melbourne. Jetstar you suck to the MAX! We had a flight to Phuket via Sydney on the 21st August cancelled and rebooked for the 23rd. We had booked upfront seats and business class and we were advised that it is ALL the same only the flight will go via Melbourne. After been told by the airport staff and the call centre staff that we would not lose the seats we had paid for, we get on the plane and told that we don't have business class seats (we lined up in business class and they didn't say anything, the gate staff said nothing) they reckon they would refund the extra money I spent on the seats in 5-7 business days, gave us 6 seats (we could only use 2) and food and beverage at no cost! POOR customer service, useless excuses and compromise only on their terms. I won't use Jetstar again!",1
"Our first sector was Sydney-Singapore to meet up with our cruise. The supposedly new aircraft looked like a tired old wreck. The carpet was so badly worn. The cabin crew were aloof, and not that approachable. They have a 'no you cannot eat, drink any food-la but ours"" policy. One lady next to me opened a small bag of chips when one female attendant came and told her 'no eating own food, not allowed so put away'. The food we had paid for was bad. I understand about keeping prices down but what we got served up was so bad. No coffee/tea for that sector but you could buy soft drinks. You were charged for everything - Blankets, food, water. The flight home was even worse. An after midnight take off, freezing cabin (if your cold you buy blanket,  only $10.) Passengers complained about cabin temperature (no can fix-la) and off they would walk.",1
"I suggest if you have options you don't book with Jetstar. I am a fiercely nationalistic Australian and jetstar is an Australian brand but I cannot support them. It appears they are going through some serious operational issues and it is not helped by bad customer service designed to Stone wall you're inquiries. I'm bitter because I just incurred $2,000 in additional cost to book an alternative to a canceled flight. If you want to head off a bad experience I'd fly others and check back to see if Jetstar gets their act together sometime in the future.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Horrible, rude customer service. I've flown budget airlines in India, US and Europe. Nowhere are the airline employees as rude as this airline. They let some customers through with 1 or 2 kgs extra weight ahead of me in my line. Saw an Indian passport and made it a point to reduce the weight to 10kgs, not a gram more. This was given the fact that I was carrying 10 lithium polymer battery is weighing 6 kgs which I had no option to check in. Avoid this airline at all costs.",1
"Perth to Bali. Absolutely shocking customer service. An error occurred when booking my flight, AirAsia was impossible to deal with and refused to change my return date unless I paid $150. I escalated the issue to management and after weeks of following up I have just received a response 2.5 months after first lodged declining to refund. Do not fly with this Airline.",1
Flew Cebu Pacific Manila to Legaspi City at 5:00PM. Chose this timing for the extended baggage limit due to aircraft being used. Was carrying about 55 kilos and I didn't face any problem at check-in as I purchased 40 kilos baggage allowance and Sports Equipment which is maximum 15 kilos ahead of my flight. Baggage handled well and was first to arrive at the destination. Ground service was great. Flight was full but slightly delayed due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was fine. Cebu Pacific is the best option for me when carrying more than 40 kilos of baggage.,0
"My first flight got cancelled and changed to a flight just a few hours away with a stopover of 7 hours. Been trying to email, call and chat for over 24 hours without any help. Probably the worst airline in the world.",1
"Flight got delayed twice, boarding was said to be half an hour. They then said that they had no idea when boarding was going to be. Flight was meant to be at 8:50am it is now 11:20 and still havent even boarded yet. Will not be flying again with Jetstar.",1
"I took Scoot on a return flight from Melbourne to Singapore. There's no in-flight entertainment, but this is acceptable given that it's a budget flight. What is unacceptable is the lack of cabin service. On the first flight, I was told by a crew member that no outside food was allowed. This is unreasonable as I have strict dietary requirements and could consume none of the main meals offered on board. None of the other airlines that I have flown with have ever picked an issue with passengers bringing their own food on board. I tried to buy a packet of nuts with my debit card but the crew first rejected my debit card, and asked for cash or credit card (which I had none), without giving any reasons. Only after I asked for the reasons that I found out that there is a limit of $20 spending on debit cards and they are phasing out debit card payments. I'm certain this wasn't made known to passengers prior to boarding. This is terrible for passengers on long haul flights who aren't aware of this limit, on top of the fact that Scoot does not allow outside food or serve water for free. The return flight was dismal. I had paid for a seat upgrade but found out that my seat could not recline as the button had dropped out. This was obviously a problem that the airline had previously known of, as there was duct tape around the sharp edges around where the button would have been. I highlighted this to the a cabin crew and her response was ""oh ya, doesn't work. Sorry about that"" and tried to walk off! I had to ask if there was a replacement seat, and (of course) there wasn't any in the same seat class. The cabin crew also talk over passengers to each other across the aisles and can come across as quite curt in their instructions / responses to passengers. I get that Scoot is trying to create a young and less formal vibe but there needs to be more courtesy in the way the cabin crew treat passengers. It is honestly quite embarrassing that Scoot is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, which prides itself on its high standards of service. I love flying on Singapore Airlines and think that they could do with more staff training for Scoot.",1
"My flight from New Plymouth to Auckland was cancelled because there was no pilot. I missed my connecting flight and had to pay over $600 to get another ticket to go to Australia which in fact I had already paid. All I got from Jetstar was a sorry. Shame on you Jetstar. Get your act together or better still reimburse people when they have proof they missed connecting flights, or pay for those flights, even better.",1
"I had not heard good reviews of Scoot, I was advised that Scoot Biz was more like Premium Economy. My husband and I could not find fault with the flight, we had a meal included and a drink (Singapore sling), which was ok as far as airline food went. If you wanted anything else you paid for it, but that's ok, I knew when I booked. The seats where very comfortable with plenty of room, our 8 hr overnight flight was great, the crew worked very hard, serving the other passengers. Will fly with Scoot again.",0
"Melbourne to Denpasar via Singapore. This is a budget airline so you get what you expect. In saying this, all flights were on time, departure was easy and carry on allowances are 10kg instead of the usual 7kg. Seats were ok, except no head rest, which you have to pay extra for. You also had to pay extra for food, water and any other beverages. Inflight entertainment was also at an additional cost as well as a blanket and pillow. You pay for a seat and that's literally all you get. Seats on the Dreamliner had better than average leg space however flights on the smaller A320 plane (DPS- SIN) were very tight. I would fly again for short haul flights, but i think for an 8 hr flight I need a blanket, meal and some sort of in flight entertainment included.",0
"Worst flight ever, a normal delay of 20 minutes without any announcement until passed the boarding time. The seats cannot recline. The flight arrived on time, but instead of letting the passengers get off the plane first, they will ""park"" the airplane to the overnight position first; before letting the passengers get off. That's extra 10-15 minutes of delay + slow luggage services from the Cebu airport. A short 35 minutes flight will become a 1 hour major production. Please improve your customer first services in your SOP.",1
I flew from Melbourne to Phuket on the new Dreamliner Star Class. The business class on the 787 is the exact seats on the Qantas A380 Premium Economy and the food of Qantas Domestic Business Class but better! The food was fantastic and the entertainment was good. Since I'm a Qantas Club member I got lounge access at both Ports so no Max Bundle needed. I was travelling with my wife and child. The overall price for all 3 of us return was only $3700! Because we needed baggage we needed to select the max bundle in economy and that added up to $4100. I couldn't believe that I was flying business class cheaper. Flight was good and the Australian Singaporean and Thai crew were excellent! One thing was that the boarding was from the front door so all the economy passengers were just looking at us like 'why would you pay that money?',0
"Sydney to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways. I bought this ticket for my family trip mainly because of it's price, and I expected the service will be not as good as the more ""regular airlines"", like Qantas. But overall, they've met my expections on the ""magazine only"" entertament system, tiny lavatory as well as the food and drink. But one thing that had exceeded my expections was the seat. The pitch was resonable for a domestic flight at 29 inches, fairly wide and the headrest was just as good as other airlines. Overall a great experience for the price.",0
Udon Thani - Phuket - Udon Thani. Both flights on time. Check in at Phuket a bit crazy because of Thai peoples lack of ability to understand which line to be in. Good friendly crew who explained the safety drill in perfect English. Captains announcements also perfectly spoken and clear. Soft drinks snacks and hot dishes are served at a cost which is not expensive. Overall a very enjoyable experience and would recommend to others.,0
"Launceston to Sydney. Jetstar have removed Check-In kiosks from Launceston Airport, meaning everyone that has checked in baggage and/or hasn't checked in online must do so at the counter. That I was okay with, however, what I found somewhat appalling was the nearly 45 minute wait to be checked in, as Jetstar have cut down staffing levels to just three team members checking in my flight and another flight to Melbourne (some 300 people in total), which left me with little time to enjoy the sights of this small but wonderful airport. Boarding was efficient, and I was also allocated an exit row seat upon my check-in. However, the crew were very robotic, and even though this was only a flight of some 90 minutes to Sydney, just did not seem to be interested or attentive. With the exception of the in-flight magazine, there was no entertainment available, and the rather limited in-flight menu made me regret not purchasing something at the airport (Vietnamese ""Pho"" was little more than a cup-a-soup with bits of meat in it). Overall, Jetstar just doesn't seem to be as good a carrier as it was just a few years ago, and when compared to recent flight experiences on Tiger Airways, doesn't seem to provide that memorable flight experience, especially where service, catering and crew are concerned. However, I would probably still continue to fly Jetstar if there was a very attractive deal (I only paid $115 for the starter plus fare to Sydney), or if they were the sole carrier offering a direct route to a destination.",0
"I have taken Scoot multiple times not because they are fantastic but due to the affordable cost. The staff were generally grumpy and unpleasant on both flights inbound and on the return. To sum it up: Scoot is the equivalent of Ryanair in Asia. I napped most of the outbound flight and did not eat or drink. My seat did not recline. I was hungry on the return flight and the staff got angry when my contactless card was declined, and prodded me to hurry up as I went through my carry on backpack to fish out my wallet for change- only to fall short by 10 cents and I had to pay in USD. I apologised and the attendant muttered something under her breath, dropped my items down on the table even as I said thank you, she walked away in a huff. Terrible customer service. The crew only cleared trash 30 minutes prior to landing so I was forced to sit with my box of pot noodles and soiled napkins for a good 90 minutes after eating. In addition, the staff kept barking out orders on the PA saying no outside food is allowed. Are we children in elementary school? Ugh. Overall, terrible service.",1
"When the return flight was changed to another time, I had the option to change the date/flight to a new one. And I tried to do this, in the process to change it seems it doesnt work and I get no confirmation email of the change. But so I find out they make up a new email which I have to register with on airasia website or some bullshit! So the ticket was changed and when it was time to check in for this flight, I also didnt see any email to my own email and I lost my flight. Customer service is only a robot, and no phone number to customers support picks up the phone.",1
"We traveled twice with Jetstar in November 2015. Only complaint is that we'd selected seats on line, aisles across from each other. Once on the plane we seated and strapped in only to be told by a young couple who said those seats belonged to them, even though we had printed boarding passes with those seat numbers noted. Naturally we called a flight attendant over who ordered us out of the seats and gave them to that young couple. The flight attendant told us to move to a window and middle seat in the back of the plane. These days one does not argue with flight attendants or they throw you off the plane so we just gave in. We always try for aisle seats because of the ease of ingress and egress. Sure, we lived through it but it was not fun to be treated in a nasty manner by an employee of the airline we'd paid actual money to for services. The flight was ""dirt dog cheap"" so I guess we got what we paid for. Cheap price, cheap experience.",1
"Brisbane to Cairns. I have flown Qantas many times and expected their sister airline to have some of the same polish and class but on that score it failed. The process used to check in could not have been more confusing and frustrating. I was over weight on baggage and the process to purchase additional kilos required visiting not one but two additional desks and then waiting in line again to check the baggage. Why does it have to be so complex? Could this airline do anything more to make a passenger feel like an object without value? The flight itself was uneventful and comfortable enough but after the difficulties checking in and paying for additional baggage (the fees were excessive and made this anything but a ""budget"" flight), I was frustrated, angered and felt entirely disrespected by the airline. I will try my best to avoid Jetstar in the future.",1
"Good airline, faster checkin. Less Queues. Only issue was lack of info on terminals in JKT. On time service from Jakarta to Bali. Baggage collection was fast",0
Flew Singapore to Gold Coast on Scoots Boeing 777 yesterday and had a most comfortable trip. This is the fourth time I have flown Scoot. Not being able to interline the bags during transit is a chore especially if you have a tight transit. If on the other hand you have a long wait between flights the Sin$5 early check-in facility is a godsend. Ground and flight staff were excellent.,0
"Osaka to Sydney via Cairns. When I am paying over a thousand bucks for a return to Japan on low cost airline Jetstar, I am paying the equivalent for a return flight to Europe. So surely the term low cost airline refers here to the shoestring budget Jetstar its service is based on and not the price tags of its flights to Japan. I am venting my frustration because there is a lack of competition. Jetstar is the main airline offering services to and from Japan. On this particular journey the flight was cancelled due to technical errors with the airplane. As a result it is taking hours to get things sorted for accommodation and rebooking. Yet I am paying a more than low-budget price for the flight.",1
"Worst experience ever. Will never fly again. All they want is to find a way to charge you extra. Seats are cramped, unprofessional behaviour of the staff, late check in and late arrival, and overall a horrible travel experience. I have flown enough low cost airlines in the world, I would rate Air Asia as the worst ever.",1
The cabin crew in Scoot BIZ were rather lacking on the outbound SIN-SYD sector and certainly on a long sector like this. On Scoot you have an entitlement and any additional was going to be chargeable - the meal was small in portion. Check-in counter staff was rude at SYD - my check in baggage was overweight by a couple of kgs but my carry on was very light - they wanted to charge a hefty amount for overweight baggage - or else take it out of your check in and carry with you the end result is still the same weight whether I carried it in my hand baggage or check in. On the return leg no blanket provided - apparently only on out bound leg.,1
My experience flying with Cebu Pacific is fine. I had no problem booking online my 2 flights (Kinabalu-Manila & Clark-HK) from Jakarta they offer great prices for such short booking. The aircraft considered new clean cabin with leather seat (just like Airasia) the cabin crew were friendly enough they have interesting merchandise to sell onboard. ...only flight from Kinabalu was getting delayed (about 1hr). but overall were OK so I won't mind flying with Cebu for my next trip.,0
Our flight TR 465 from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore scheduled to depart on 25 Oct 2019 at 10.20pm was delayed to 11.30pm and then delayed to 12.10am - now they just announced will depart at 1.10am.  Do they have any concerns on passengers inconvenience.,1
"Melbourne to Christchurch on Jetstar. Friendly and efficient cabin crew, clean aircraft and efficient boarding. Seating is cramped to the point of being painful. Flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. For a 2 hour 45 minute flight, it's fine. A lot of choice in terms of extras on board (food, entertainment) which can help pass the time.",0
"This was my first time using ArirAsia, I booked a return flight from Kuala Lumpur - Bangkok. The flight was delayed by an hour on the way to Bangkok but this wasn't really a problem as it was an early morning flight so couldn't check in to my hotel anyways. We boarded the plane and it was clean and staff were welcoming. We arrived at Bangkok a little later then expected. On our return flight we ran into a few problems, upon arriving at the airport in Bangkok the flight was being showed as delayed and when we were checking in the staff informed that the flight was delayed due to a late departure from it origin airport. We sat in the terminal waiting for updates, one hour after we were supposed to depart we were allowed to board the plane and sat down in our allocated seats. The captain announced that the flight was going to be further delayed due to a faulty tire on the plane and it would take around 45-60 minutes to replace the tire. The captain kept us updated throughout the process, after roughly and hour we set off from Bangkok and were quickly in the skies. Thirty minutes into the flight I couldn't help but notice that the engine was making a very loud noise, it was a lot louder than usual. We circled the airport for around about thirty minutes when the captain announced we needed to re land at the airport due to engine problems. We landed back in Bangkok and were escorted to a terminal where we were told to await further instructions, we were given food vouchers while we had to wait and given the means to make calls. After a two hour wait we finally boarded and were on our way to Kuala Lumpur. We landed around five hours later than we were supposed to staff at the customer services were not very helpful and didn't really make and effort to understand passengers complaints. Other than the return flight it wasn't too bad and it was a budget airline after all.",0
"Jetstar ""Star Class"" is not worth it. Flew to Honolulu with Jetstar for holidays the tickets were not cheap but I think it was more premium economy at business class prices. No priority boarding. No priority baggage first off and last to get baggage. The all Thai cabin crew did not seem to have been well trained they were very friendly but the service was slow and haphazard. Some meals came out fast others really slow to arrive dessert of ice cream was liquid when it finally arrived. Food would be classed as average for economy on most airlines definately not what I would call ""business class"". Seats were not that comfortable and had lacked in legroom the seat in front hit my knees when reclined. Inflight entertainment of iPad took an hour to come out after departure and there was no place to hang it it was in my lap while I ate meal over the top of it. Not exactly classy. It was three times the price of an economy ticket and definitely not worth it. I am one very unhappy customer and will never fly Jetstar again.",1
BLR-BOM return. On time departure arrival before scheduled time for both flights. Smooth check-in process and assignment of seats. Clean and spotless aircraft's legroom a bit limited though. Cabin crew very efficient and lot of smiles. Masala tea bought on board was tasty. Bus rides between gates and aircraft. On return leg we were transiting from SIN (different airline) and had excess baggage. They just checked the boarding passes for the international leg and did not charge anything extra as baggage fees!,0
"Indonesia AirAsia is the worst airline ever. We had to board the airplane early, just to have wait in the bus, with the air conditioners off and doors wide open in 32 degree weather for a whole 40 minutes. Without any explanation whatsoever on whats happening.",1
Jetstar are terrible to deal with and create stress. Flight was initially direct then we were notified it would change to a stopover in Sydney. That was the start of our frustration as flying with small children is challenging at the best of times. Then on check in we discovered our baggage wasnt included. Although only a couple of kilos over for carry on we would be charged $120 and have to reprint our tickets 3 times from 2 different desks and check in our carry on bags and have to pick up and transfer our own luggage between flights. Due to the tiny seating spaces and my above average height once again I sit separate to my family in some vacant seats offered by one of the flight attendants probably the best and worst service at the same time received. On arrival to Sydney Im advised I can go out and recheck the bags while the family stays inside. So I do so and on attempting this am told I cannot re enter the airport and check my familys bags and they would have to come out and that we couldnt re check them in for another 2 hrs. When we are finally rechecking in we accidentally remove our carry on bag checked stickers and are then told our bags are not packed correctly and they will have to be repacked now waiting to see how the second part of the trip will pan out with a very tired and frustrated family and our second flight is delayed. Extremely disappointing end to our holiday hoping our travel improves.,1
Perth to Singapore - Scootbiz. Overall a good product check in very efficient through dedicated Biz desk young man was very friendly and professional he also mentioned we could board the plane as soon as boarding begins. Unfortunately no option to purchase Business Lounge Access at Perth. Boarding was efficient with a call to all Scoot biz to board at the start excellent much improved on last time. Boarded the cabin to realise there were only 4 people of the 32 seat occupied in the Biz section as always we were greeted warmly when boarding the plane. Drink orders were taken before take off and we were allowed any drink on their menu something not offered on our previous trip so improving all the time opted for Singapore slings we were told we would get these after take off. As with Biz we were provided with a small sealed cup of water like you get in economy take off was earlier than expected which I was impressed with. It was about 30 minutes after we took off when we were provided with our pre ordered meal not bad with small can of pringles and a bottle of pre mixed Singapore sling with a cup of ice overall good for budget maybe disappointing for any other service. Once again we were unable to use the entertainment system this time using a tablet instead of a laptop but once again no luck. We rarely saw the cabin staff and they did not come out and give us the code to access the entertainment. Scoot need to look at this as I don't think I'm the only one to have this issue. My favourite part of the experience is the seat its like premium economy comfortable with 38 inch leg room and 20inch width great for a 5 hour flight. Overall its a Premium economy cabin with a budget service.,0
"Manila to Osaka. I am a solo female traveller on a budget not looking for lavish airlines or awesome plane meals, basic service is fine. Cebu cannot offer that and they screwed me over. 4 hour delay, desk was not saying why or when we would go. Delay caused me to miss my connecting flight booked on the same booking and Cebu will not provide any reimbursement. Had to repurchase two flights, would of been cheaper to fly with a legitimate airline. No one from Cebu was at the gate or terminal to help once arrived and before departure only 1 of 5 people sitting at the desk was actually helping out. Told one of the people at the desk about my concern for my connecting flight after 3 hours delay and he barely uttered Cebu is only responsible to get you to Osaka and walked off in the corner on his phone helping no other customers not even giving me a certificate of delay. On arrival there is absolutely no one from Cebu to help transferring customers and no other staff to talk to as its 11:30pm (5 mins after my flight left) and the airline phone number is closed till 9am. This cost me a sleepless night in an airport and over $500 dollars to fix. Cebu has offered me no help. Avoid at all cost.",1
Cairns to Sydney via Melbourne. I am so disappointed with my experiences with Jetstar thus far. My first flight being cancelled after already checking in luggage. Having to stay an extra night in cairns delaying plans and bookings for that night and the next day. We were given false information at the counter and different info at the hotel we were put into about a food allowance given. The queues were extremely long and slow in cairns on Saturday morning further stressing my experience.. we then had a flight this morning from Sydney where the staff were extremely rude laughing about our situation on this flight and commenting about it while we waited to board our flight. Saying' it happens to the best of us' Also getting off the flight we had an airhostess repeatedly raising her voice shouting at us and other customers to get off the flight through the front door. I am so upset and disappointed. My experience has been terrible. I feel there was no remorse no help and there also doesnt seem to be much assistance where needed. My review gives minus stars. Not the experience i was promised.,1
"SYD to MEL and back. The flight was fine you don't expect too much on such a short flight. No IFE and food and drink prices were reasonable. I had a coffee which was surprisingly good. The bugbear was the check in. Massive queues at Sydney but moving quickly due to the fully manned bag drops. However in Melbourne for the return two ""jobsworths"" asked where passengers were travelling to and only allowed certain flights to join the queue. Consequently when they did finally condescend to allow us in it was an almighty scramble to get the bag dropped and to the gate before the flight. Really let the airline sown. It wasn't that they were busy just two women exercising their power! That is reason I downmarked the staff service option because cabin crew were great.",0
"Jakarta to Surabaya. Only 15 minutes delay. Otherwise the usual Lion Air flight. Pretty crew and free checked-in luggage, cramped seats that at least did recline, and no food or drinks.",0
We flew Scoot from the Gold Coast in early April and the experience left me feeling pretty flat. Serious delays on all 3 sectors. This airline seems to be regularly running late. The ticket price may be cheap but the delays make the airline poor value for money.,1
"My gate baggage was missing at Delhi airport. At the last minutes of boarding , airline staff asked me to take off the power bank from my gate baggage. And I did. But when I got to Bangkok, my bag was not on flight. Airport staff didn't put my bag in my flight on time. And today is the 5th day, I didn't get any information and the bag yet.",1
Recently flew the Narita (Tokyo) - Gold coast route Star Class. Checking staff at Narita - very Ordinary! Delayed by 2 hrs departing - Tech issue just prior to take off - had to get towed back to the gate. In all fairness the Captain did the correct thing and didn't take off - he kept us all up updated via the loud speaker. Finally took off 2 hours later. Missed my connecting flight - then had to go on stand by - what a joy that was. The actual trip back to Aust was a very smooth flight - very little noise. Cabin crew were quite good. Food was very good. Far better than I received on my outgoing Qantas Business Class flight. Star Class seating was fine - have to keeping mind its a budget carrier. Would I Fly Star Class Internationally again? Most defiantly - Its far cheaper and you still get the feel that your special. I would sooner pocket the savings I would make on traveling with Jetstar B/C to Qantas B/C. By the way my outgoing flight to Tokyo was on a very old rattly 747- although they have upgraded the Business class to flat beds. The flight crew were all due to be pensioned off - couldn't believe how old they all appeared to be - however they all were very polite and attentive in Business class I say bring on more new 787s - very good flying experience.,0
I could not check in online therefore did not know that luggage food and entertainment had to be pre- booked. At the airport we had to pay $240 for luggage because I had not checked in online. This holiday was purchased as a package and the flights were to be with Jetstar. The trip took too long overall with waiting time in airports but the worst part was that on the return the flight was supposed to leave Phuket at 7.30pm and was delayed until 9.30pm. Staff kept assuring us the flight to Australia would wait for us. This did not happen and the plane left before we arrived were put up in sub standard hotel for the night. Quite a long day for a 1.5 hour flight from Phuket. Not acceptable. I also told staff we had a domestic flight booked to Brisbane on the Sunday and they told me it was nothing to do with them.,1
Return flights booked from Manila to Caticlan. The flight out was meant to be at midday but was delayed several times with no announcements before we eventually were taken out on the bus to the plane 3.5 hours late. We were taken back to the terminal again and told the flight was cancelled. We were then put on a later flight to Kalibo even though we had paid to fly to Caticlan - this was to leave at 5pm. This flight was then delayed 30 then 60 then 90 minutes finally leaving at 8.45pm. This got us to Kalibo at around 10pm and we then had to get a coach for 2 hours to get us to where we should have been at 1pm. We finally got to our destination at 1:30am - about 12 hours after we should have. The night before we flew back we got an email to say our flight was cancelled and we were to call them to rebook or get a refund. We rang and could not get through to anyone. As a result we had to book a Philippines airline flight at our expense to ensure we got back to Manila for our connecting flight home a total disaster. Trying to get a refund from them for the cancelled flight took over 30 minutes on the phone and it will then be 10 business days until the refund is even processed. Will never fly them again.,1
"Was not informed of needing a PCR test so attempted to change flight but was not allowed nor was refund even considered and had to buy another flight. Was only refunded ""airport services fees"" but not the preflight charges paid for and never used which include seat charges, meal charges, and baggage charges. If non Japan resident, you are unable to purchase travel insurance nor is there a toll free number to speak to anyone from the airline; just an outsourced ISA in a non English/Japanese speaking country who does not care about customer retention. Have a magnifying glass handy when purchasing your ticket so you can read the fine print that is meant to benefit the airline and cheat the customer.",1
Pre-booked and paid for inflight entertainment but this service was not available when I asked after boarding. Now I had to find ways to entertain my kid for 7 hours. Instead of giving me a full cash refund for non- provision of service I was offered a $20 voucher valid until July 2013 for 'additional baggage allowance and meal or to upgrade your seats for your future flight'. I have no plans to travel before then and I definitely unlikely to fly Scoot again! Throughout the 7+ hour flight the call buttons were ringing non-stop making any sleep impossible. The call button is placed right beside the armrest and almost everyone accidentally pressed it. Seats were hard and toilets need more regular cleaning.,1
Shame that Jetstar have shifted too far towards money making rather than customer service. I find most elements efficient. The planes are usually modern and well maintained inside. Cabin crew are fine. They used to be my first port of call and I've flown return to Sydney 7 times in the last six months but will look elsewhere now. While they haven't don't anything wrong we turned up for a flight early due to a meeting finishing sooner than expected. We asked if there was a chance of avoiding a five hour wait by shifting to an earlier flight if they had availability. Handily a flight was leaving in 35 minutes with plenty of space. Would they move us? Yes for $300 more. Seeing as our ticket only cost $400 for a return that didn't seem good value. We pointed out that if they shifted us onto a flight leaving in 30 minutes with no chance of selling that space they would then have 4-5 hours to sell our seats on to someone else. No chance. Against company policy. Both customer service agent and check in agent told us the same thing. Both very helpful and both said it's a silly rule. Virgin on the other hand have no problems moving something forward.,1
Hobart - Melbourne on an A320. There was a long queue for the baggage drop - there seems little advantage in using the machine to tag your own bag. Once on board any size or weight of take-on baggage seems acceptable so that we were told to keep our reasonable sized bags around our feet so that other people who had got large bulging bags on board could stow theirs in the overhead lockers. The seat seemed to have a slightly greater pitch than on the Jetstar A321. The flight operated 20 minutes late but was generally a pleasant experience.,0
"Hong Kong to Manila with Cebu Pacific - low cost, low quality. You definitely get what you pay for. Christmas season is the busiest time in the year to travel and had no other optios but Cebu on the date and time I had to leave Hong Kong. I have flown with them in the past and this flight it was like a deja vu. The aircraft coming from MNL arrived 2 hours late. None of the staff at their check in counters knew what was going on, and didn't mention the delay when I was checking in. I could have spent an extra two hours with my friend who took me to the airport. Second, when we were inside the aircraft, we were delayed for another 35 minutes. I must commend the friendly cabin crew who profusely apologised. Their customer service skills were good. I did not eat the food offered - it looked more like a ration. When we arrived in MNL, the air bridge was not working, so we all had to go down the stairs to the tarmac and up to the stairs to get inside the airport. It was an unpleasant pre-Christmas flight. Cebu Pacific has to understand that although passengers are aware that they are operating low cost, they should be on time, improve the food, ad keep passenger comfort in mind.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya with AirAsia. Swift check-in and orderly boarding followed by a 25 mins late departure due to some passengers not showing up. Plane nearly full, crew all male. Uneventful flight.",0
"I was well aware of all the mixed reviews this airline has been getting and was not expecting much as it is a budget carrier. MEL-MNL was delayed by 4 hours as bad weather in Manila delayed the inbound plane, was handed over a meal card to spend while waiting. New and quiet aircraft, seats don't recline, though they are already somewhat recline, Pre-booked meals are expensive thank God you can buy snacks onboard. MNL-MEL ontime, boarding - there is no process really apart from the Elders and Adults with child boarding 1st. Again same type of aircraft, Middle toilets were not working and they have to attached plastic liners for passengers to throw their rubbish, very unsanitary. Overall I am satisfied as long as their is no drama, they are Non-Stop and because this is last minute, the Fare difference from legacy carriers was a factor for me.",0
"Penang to Melbourne via Singapore. Our flight TR423 experienced a delay of approximately one hour due to an inbound flight delay. Upon our arrival at the Singapore airport, the crew members on TR423 requested that we move to the front seats in order to facilitate a quicker disembarkation. I would like to extend my appreciation to those Scoot crew members for their assistance. However, upon reaching Gate 35 at 2:20 am, I encountered two Scoot ground members who not only failed to provide us with directions to the gate as expected, but also informed us, along with five other passengers on the same route, that we were not allowed to proceed to the TR18 gate. Instead, they insisted that we go to terminal 3 to catch the Singapore Airlines flight SQ207 to Melbourne. During this time, one of the passengers was chatting with a friend on TR18 via WeChat and was informed that the TR18 flight was still at the gate, with the door open and waiting for us. We immediately conveyed this information to the Scoot ground members, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Shockingly, despite being aware of the situation, the two ground members adamantly refused our request and directed us to the SATs Lounge. When I inquired about the refund for the Economy to Economy Plus seat upgrade that I had paid for, I was simply told to contact Scoot online for assistance. As a result of their refusal, the doors of TR18 closed promptly at 2:55 am, preventing me from boarding the flight.",1
"Every time I travel, I always take a nap during the flight. Unfortunately, the flight crews were very noisy chit-chatting about their personal lives. Me and my husband were seated at the back, literally the last seat, so we could really hear them talking about their credit cards, their colleagues personal life, the bag, the shoes etc. So, I looked at them just to give them a hint that they were being loud, but they ignored me and continued with their personal business. The flight was full at that time and one crew put her luggage under my seat. She just grabbed her luggage without saying excuse me which made my chair shake and woke me up. For the number of times I have travelled with Cebu Pacific, one thing I have noticed is that the cabin crews are rude and have no empathy. Their eyebrows are always on arch as if they own the world. Their service will depend on who they are talking to. We filipinos are known for being respectful and hospitable. I hope the company should pay attention to their staff attitude. We are all equal here, paying more or paying less, passenger is a passenger.",1
"Two years ago I had to cancel my flight to Bali from Perth due to the pandemic. I was ""approved"" a full refund from AirAsia ($700+) and told to be patient as they understandably were busy with refunds. I have regularly tried to follow this up since then, each time being told to be patient. I have not been able to contact them since October last year and my last communication said that they could not find the booking number! Terrible customer service and I have the feeling that the refund will not happen. Do not use this airline.",1
"Brisbane to Honolulu via Sydney with Jetstar Airways. Schedule changes prior to flight which I wasnt notified about. Re-booked on flights which gave 35 mins to connect from domestic to international in SYD. 2 hours 10 minutes in the check-in line  no exaggeration. Then we were given seats 10 rows away from each other although we had paid to be together. We disputed this and eventually were assigned seats together. Once onboard people were in our seats and had same seat numbers printed on their boarding passes however they had not paid for their seat requests. Crew asked me ""if I really wanted to split up a family""? Boeing 787 made my throat very dry. Uncomfortable seats and armrests not padded. Toilet flushes while sitting on it. The filthy toilet seat closes on my back when I am sitting on the toilet. On return flight, toilet in the small cabin around row 12 was out of order and the cabin smelt terrible.  I asked for a cup of water and was handed a 1.5L bottle to pour myself whilst standing. Crew napping (dayflight 9 hours) and toilets were filthy. I could go on.",1
The AirAsia app offers flights combined with other airlines. I booked a flight through the AirAsia app; the first leg operated by Lion and the second by AirAsia. You assume it's one booking (like code sharing) but it's not. Lion was delayed so I missed the connecting flight. Bad luck I had to buy a new ticket to continue my trip. They don't take any responsibility and claim that you booked it through an agent. When you try to file a complaint that's impossible ... you have to chat with that stupid chat bot but that's useless.,1
Recently flew from Sydney to KL on Air Asia the flight was pleasant and the staff were friendly. This airline is great value for money and perfect for getting you from point A to B for a fraction of the cost. Inflight entertainment and food is optional yet not necessary. I would recommend upgrading to the quiet zone for a few extra dollars. A number of us also travelled with bikes and other excess luggage the airline was great in taking care of this and we travelled without an issue. I would defiantly recommend and will be returning to Malaysia with them in the future.,0
"Melbourne to Sydney. Avoid this airline. Trust me it is worth paying a bit extra for an airline that has at least some notion of customer service. Today Jetstar cancelled our flight with only 6 hrs notice and informed us that they could not possibly get us on an alternative flight until tomorrow. This is bad enough but even worse is the way they insult your intelligence by spinning the lie that the cancellation is due to ""weather conditions"" (clearly a lie as not only did other airlines have flights on the same route , Jetstar themselves had flights leaving both before and after the one they had chosen to cancel.) This is the 2nd time in 14 months Jetstar has cancelled on us with their ""too bad your problem"" attitude. There will not be a third time because only if Jetstar were the only airline left flying would I board them again.",1
"Melbourne to Brisbane. Worse airline! Cheap for a reason. Bad customer service, they just treat you like a number. They change flights, charge you $60 if your carryon bag is over by just a little bit, they make you walk to the plane from the gate even when if it's raining bad, they just do whatever they want! And their planes are small and uncomfortable",1
"Flight was punctual. But no comfortable seating, the crew do not care about the passengers at all. I did not book food. The crew did not ask passengers whether they need food or not. Alcohol they gave to many people for a price.",1
I am shocked and disgusted with the customer service from Cebu Pacific. My flight was cancelled in March and I was told I would receive a refund by August/September at the latest. I have not received a refund and my emails are now being ignored.  I feel like I have been treated with disrespect and it is not good enough.,1
"Delhi to Varanasi. This was my first flight with IndiGo and I was accompanied with my sister and her three children (2 kids and 1 infant). At Check-In we were given priority due to family. I was informed that they won't be able to accommodate us in one row as the seats were full. On my request, the Lady at the counter talked to her Supervisor and allotted us seats in the first row (which are paid seats) without any extra fee. That was really surprising and too generous of them. The boarding was smooth, the aircraft was clean and the food (paid) was good. It was a comfortable flight with very attentive and hospitable cabin crew. Even the ground staff was very helpful and courteous. The flight was on time and luggage reclaim was almost smooth. IndiGo definitely lived up-to it's tagline of on-time budget airline. Would definitely love to fly it again.",0
Delhi to Kochi last Friday. Check in was efficient by friendly smartly dressed staff. My check in bag was over the 15kg limit. When I mentioned that my hand luggage was much lighter it was suggested I transfer between bags thus saving a hefty fee. Good clean aircraft but the pre-ordered meal was a disappointment. A packed fast food instant rice or noodle concoction possibly the type served to astronauts in deep space.,0
"My original flight was moved to a time I couldn't get there. The flight change notification promised a refund or a flight change. I needed to change my flight to a different airport so the agent told me I would need to just book a new flight and they would issue a refund for the original flight. I went ahead and booked the new flight, but never received the refund. I have tried everything I could and this company refuses to speak with me about the issue. I've tried submitting new tickets and cases since I can't get an agent to speak with me and they decline to refund, saying the flight wasn't canceled so it's not eligible for a refund. I have sent screen shots of the e-mail where the refund was promised and they are just ignoring me completely.",1
"Phuket to Kuala Lumpur was my first flight with AirAsia. It was also my first experience of an aborted take off, which was annoying at the time but reassuring that the pilot was following the correct protocol and didn't dismiss the warning. After 1 hour and 15 mins, we departed to Kuala Lumpur, flight was short and sweet!",0
"It all went downhill once I checked it in Singapore for a round trip to Bangkok. This airline charges for your first checked bag - for both legs of a round trip. My fare was only $150 but my fare for one suitcase was $100. When I showed my displeasure I was asked if I wanted to pay the fee. ""What choice do I have?"" I snapped back. But I was assured the fee of $50 would be for both ways and was told to keep the receipt to show when I checked in for my return flight. They either lied or didn't know their own airline's procedures. Things were no better on the plane where everything had a price - water coffee even the blankets and pillows. In addition the seat backs are only fabric on the bottom half and the knees of the person behind you can be felt for the whole trip particularly since there was scant room for your legs. Never again.",1
"I am a frequent domestic flyer and several times I have traveled with IndiGo. Apart from one or two exceptions, every time the flight I booked was cancelled and I was re-booked on another flight. It was alright when the re-booking was done for another flight at the same time but lately the re-booked flights are at very inconvenient times. As a female passenger traveling alone, I could not accept the revised time of 21.50 reaching my destination at 23.05 for my last booked flight. The only other alternative for me is a flight one day later. Not to mention the unexpected delays in airport. I do not recommend IndiGo flights. The chances of getting your entire schedule messed up is pretty high with Indigo.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. I paid extra for extra leg room because I have a knee issue, seats changed without notice only after complaining I got a $50 dollar voucher. Next time tried to use said vouchers, great they spelt my name wrong the voucher is unusable, flight goes up in price more than the voucher is worth while it takes them a week to change the name.",1
"Bali to Melbourne. Awful customer support in dealing with COVID-19. They should be offering full refunds to their customers during this time, not trying to capitalize via voucher. I begrudgingly must take a voucher that I never will be able to use again and therefore, I am the one who loses in this situation.",1
KUL-HKT-KUL. I accept that if you don't pay to choose a seat it will be selected randomly. But to split people up on the same booking (my wife was in the row behind me) is ridiculous. Outward flight 15 minutes late (it appeared that someone's bag was being offloaded so maybe someone failed to board the flight) before arriving into the chaos of Phuket airport arrivals (I reviewed this airport separately).,1
"Jakarta to Bali. So happy to see AirAsia finally use paper box for their food. I hope they will provide reusable spoon and forks instead of plastic soon. I had Pak Nasser Nasi Lemak, the taste has changed, the chicken tasted more like curry. Taste good, just was not what I was hoping for. Flight attendants was friendly and very helpful.",0
First time with Jetstar to Bangkok on 17th December. The flight from Singapore to Bangkok was fine. 15 minutes into the return flight to Singapore we had to return to Bangkok as ice had formed on the wings. We waited for more than 2 hours at the airport without knowing what would happen next. There was no communication between the ground staff and the passengers. We did even get a drink from the ground staff. Only when we approached the staff then we realized we had to stay in Bangkok for another night. Without giving proper instructions we were lead like blind mice around the airport. We waited again for more than half an hour before we were transported to a hotel near the airport. The ground staff were not be able to handle the situation well which left us feeling lost and frustrated. This will be my first and last flight with Jetstar.,1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Flying out from Melbourne for family emergency in Sydney. Flight delayed by over 3 hours. Whilst we were told that there are technical issues, no time frames as to resolution. I would've thought the company of this size would have business continuity plan in place for situations like this. Apparently not. As we were waiting to learn our faith that morning, another 4-5 flights have been delayed. As I was getting ready that same night to fly back to Melbourne, I received a message that my flight was cancelled, less than 2 hours before planned departure and was only accommodated the following morning, arriving to Melbourne after 10am. And what did JetStar say on all of that: ""sorry"".",1
"Delhi to Varanasi. An early morning flight without any hassle, departure, and arrival was on time. The landing was a bit rough considering normal weather conditions. The only thing which bothered me was the cleanliness of the plane.",0
"JQ30 on 16th June was my first flight on the new Dreamliner. In row 2 of Business Class, I had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. There is an inherent design problem with JQ's configuration: Row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts Row 2 seats' access and space. When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms. The food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 Business Class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front. I will not use this service to SEAsia again as Economy with carriers like Cathay is far more comfortable and better value.",1
"Manila to Puerto Princesa. At the airport in Manila, a service minded guy named Salahay helped us to get the right advice. He transferred us to a desk with a helpful girl who booked our tickets. It went smooth and fast, they also spoke excellent English. They treated us well! Recommend.",0
I am a regular traveler that will never use Jetstar again. So they cancelled my flight from Hobart to Melbourne on the 1/12/19. Provided accommodation but would not pay for transportation to and from there accommodation which was a cost of over $120 I was told I could make a claim through Jetstar. The earliest flight the next day they offered was a late afternoon flight which didnt suit my requirements I booked an early morning flight with Tigerair to get home. So I dont use there return flight giving them an extra 2 seats on there plane I pay for my return trip out of my own pocket so because I never took their flight that didnt suit my requirements Im ineligible to get a refund in my taxi fares. Jetstar will do anything to get out of reimbursements of any kind Jetstar are corporate thieves and I will never use their service again. Unhappy regular traveler.,1
"Woeful. This is a tricky review. We tried to travel on this airline twice, but one of the flights was cancelled, so this review is for the flight we did take, plus the service around the one we didn't. 1st flight (the cancelled one) - Manila to Caticlan (Boracay) 4 June. Arrived at the domestic airport more than 2 hrs before flight knowing Manila airport is a shocker, and wanted to make sure we allowed plenty of time. Joined a slow moving check in queue, wondering why our flight number wasn't displayed. At exactly 2 hrs before flight departure, a garbled voice announced over the PA ""Cebu flight DG6243 to Caticlan is cancelled"". This was both amusing and worrying, not just cancelled but definitely cancelled ? This was the first we'd heard of it. I happened to look at my phone and lo and behold, a helpful email at the same time alerts me to the cancellation as well. Made it to the front of the queue to be told to join another queue to organise another Cebu Pacific flight. Spending more time at Manila airport than necessary was not appealing, so decided to book another carrier and get a refund from Cebu instead. Misinformation and delays ensued. Ticket office to get refund located outside the terminal, and knowing our new flight would be closing in 30 mins, and stringent security to get back into the terminal, decided to lodge refund request by phone instead. Did this on 5 June, it was approved, and were told it would take a week. Two weeks later still waiting.  2nd Flight - Caticlan to Manila 10 June. Quick checkin this time, though for some reason it took 4 staff to do it ? All giggling and having a great time. Asked if we had a connecting flight from Manila (that should have been a dead giveaway, more later), told them yes, but in 6 hours. Bit of Spanish and more giggling ensued. Boarding passes given, which was a relief. Went upstairs to the waiting lounge and watched our flight go from On Time to Delayed before our eyes, as were all following flights. To be fair, the delay was caused by air traffic in Manila, but would have appreciated to be told at checkin. Flight ended up being only 45 mins delayed, and when the heavens opened, Cebu ground staff gave us umbrellas to walk across the tarmac. I'd booked seats in row 3 looking for a quick getaway, but of course, this particular plane only allowed boarding and disembarkation from the back! Service on board was pretty much non-existent due to the short 1 hr trip, which was fine by me. My hubby's seat was so old he had a steel rod poking him in the back, so he was bolt upright the whole time. The people in row 1 were sitting backwards, facing the people in row 2, never seen anything like it!  Avoid if you can. We booked Skyjet as our alternate carrier to Caticlan and they were brilliant. Pricier, but at least we got a plane!",1
"I've travelled indigo Airlines before and had a pleasant experience with them. However this one particular flight was terrible, we were flying out of Mumbai to Phuket. We entered the aircraft on the tarmac, and we entered a Mosquito infested cabin. Mumbai Airport seems to have a mosquito problem and this is a health and safety issue. During my flight I was bitten nearly a dozen times. The officials at Indigo Airlines and Mumbai Airport really need to tackle this Mosquito problem that exists at the airport. Thank you",0
"Auckland to Melbourne. After a system shutdown we had to wait almost 3 hours to check in and drop the luggage off. The flight before us got canceled. We were able to check in at the same time that our plane would have departed so we actually started 60 minutes late. The flight was 4 hours long and we didnt get a single drop of (free) water. You had to buy everything. When I landed in Melbourne (still 45 minutes late) I went to pick up my suitcase. It wasnt there. I spoke to the women at the lost counter and it turned out my bag was still in Auckland. Its been 48 hours now and i just received my bag. I didnt hear anything all day yesterday and I couldnt find any updates on the internet. So I called them almost 10 times over the last two days. I had to take care that I get my suitcase back even tho it wasnt my fault it got lost in the first place. Finally the women told me it arrived in Melbourne (after 24 hours) and its ready to get delivered to my apartment (after more than 40 hours). Then i didnt get a call that the courier arrived, I waited the whole day near the apartment. Instead I got an email telling me I had missed the courier and I had to pick it up myself from the airport. I called again. and luckily the courier was so nice to go back and deliver it.  Never flying with JetStar again. Wasnt worth the 144$ I paid.",1
Flight Jakarta to Bali was 2 hours delayed. Return flight 3 hours delayed. I tried to call their service center several times but no one answers the phone. No notification of delays until you get to the airport. Time is extremely important when traveling. It is obvious that despite their reasonably low fares they don't care for their customers. I will never fly this airline again.,1
"I took this flight 6E 12 from Istanbul to New Delhi on 15th December 2023 time was 8:15 Pm ( Turkey Time ). The plane was big. But the space in between legs and other seat was so small that it was feeling so suffocating that it was so hard to breathe as there was no proper air flow.  As me and my friend was so hungry so we expected food to come fast but they took time may be some technical issue. So when they bring food and said its paid, we are so heart broken that we gave almost 82000 rupees for the tickets and they are still asking for money to give a single sandwich or juice or you can say just a small meal?  Even sometimes you have to select a seat while booking the tickets as there will be no seats but when you enter the plane sometimes the plane is almost empty.  Please stop making money by harassing people.",1
"Flew Indigo from BDQ to CCU via DEL. The IndiGo has some of the most courteous and helpful FAs. Despite the fact that my family didn't get seats together, FAs helped us swap seats with other passengers. FAs are also very kid-friendly. The meal service in IndiGo economy class is better than the meal service of every US-carrier on domestic routes. The food was absolutely delicious. During Delhi transit, we were asked to stay in our seats while the crew changed and cabin was cleaned for on-going flight to Kolkata. We were offered additional snacks while we were waiting inside the cabin. Our experience on DEL-CCU segment was also excellent. The only IndiGo process that I find to be strange is when they check your boarding pass as you disembark the aircraft.",0
"The worst costumer service I have ever experienced. We asked the fight attendant if can we sit together, he said that the plane will be imbalanced. Seriously this is the reason he had to give me and humiliated me front of everyone. You need to start training your staff for better experience for the customer.",1
MEL-KUL KUL-CMB return. One flight cancelled before the travel date however I was given the option to change all flights without additional cost. Surprised by good service although food quality could improve. Value for money. Only real negative is the high price for picking seats ($25n MEL-KL ).,0
KUL-PDG and KNO-KUL. Always a demonstration for a quality product on the ground and in the sky. Good information from booking until departure well trained and nice-to-look-at cabin crews good flight-deck-info good food and on-time. This airlines grows and grows and seems to have no visible problems with staff quantity/training logistics etc.,0
"The AirAsia flight we were supposed to board came in 2 hours late because of bad weather. Apart from this delay, we were made to wait another 2+ hours because there was no crew! I can understand the weather delay (although that could have been mitigated by ensuring a longer gap in between the landing time and take off time of a particular flight), but the non-availability of crew is inexcusable! Further, they decided to commence boarding of the next flight before us.",1
"Bengaluru to Mumbai. Due to the corona virus outbreak there was hardly any passengers travelling on this flight. So check in was a breeze. The check in agents were quite helpful and they had a bottle of hand sanitizers on their desks which was well appreciated. The boarding commenced well before the scheduled time of departure and it was clear that travel was at a minimum as the flight was quite empty The crew were polite enough and even though I slept for most part of the flight, the departure and arrival was well before time. Baggage retrieval was a breeze as there were hardly any passengers and this was a very uneventful flight. Fortunately the flight was not cancelled as there were numerous flights which got called off due to the pandemic. So thank you for a safe flight.",0
"Sydney to Melbourne. Seems with this airline that the flight staff have plenty of attitude and no customer service abilities. Honestly, the quicker they understand the customer comes first and not there work colleagues and there hair extensions the better this airline will be.",1
Web checkin info is unclear and passenger is made to pay Rs.200 for not web checkin.  International travellers are not allowed to carry more then 15kg of luggage whereas the international allows 40 kg it means international travellers be away. International connecting is allowed to carry 30kg on payment of RS. 6600. Even after paying RS 6600/- the passenger must pay extra RS 2000 if made 2 bags instead of 1 bag of 30kg. Travellers are charged for seat selection.,1
"Booked return tickets on 9/01/2019 from Denpasar-Banda Aceh 14/01 and return Banda Aceh- Denpasar 27/01. I called customer service on 9/01 to double check how to book the baggage on my way back 27/01 because there is no option to choose from Banda Aceh to Medan, but the customer service said I don't have to worry because I still have 20kg free baggage, because the new system is not officially confirmed yet. And on 27/01 in Banda Aceh airport when I do check in, I forced to pay 1.820.000; IDR on the spot which is half price of my travel fees, after 2 hours tried to get some help from customer service and they can't do anything just asked me to pay first the baggage and then the next day asked me to call customer service for comparing or claim. Called them the next day almost 1and half hour calls, they are just only able to say sorry and they don't accept their mistake and not able to return the baggage fee which actually I have to pay for their mistake, who didn't give me clear information and never update the information. It is really SAD, as we wanted to speak to the manager of lion Air but they say not available. I gave thumb down to this Airline as they gave me unpleasant experience.",1
"Miserable to non existent customer service, every single flight is delayed and no prior notice or updates are given. For the latest flight we were ushered into the gate area with no restrooms, no seating and no update given about the delay, there wasnt even a person at the counter until well after the departure time. Easily the worst of budget airlines, please take your money elsewhere.",1
"I havent even flown with this company yet and there is already a problem. I booked a flight via AirAsia web site and the payment was rejected. I booked the same flight via another agent. 2 hours later, I found out that the initial payment had already been taken out of my account. Nil customer service.",1
Gold Coast to Colombo Sri-Lanka Via Kuala Lumpur. Flight was good and food tasted alright. We had no problems with baggage and staff were not all that bad. I didn't like the fact that you had to pay extra for in- flight entertainment and had no screen on the back of the seat in front of you but that is common with most budget airlines. I would certainly recommend Air Asia just remember you get what you pay for.,0
"Bangkok to Phnom Penh. We arrived early in Don Muaeng airport, Bangkok, for an evening flight to Phnom Penh. We had checked in online, at baggage drop no lines. Through immigration and security also went fast, we talk about less than 5 minutes, very good ! Suvarnabhumi airport should go here and learn. They started boarding 30 minutes before schedule. We had bus out to the gate, and 10 minutes before schedule, we arrived at the plane. The plane was not full this evening, so it started to move, only 3 minutes late. Its pretty narrow onboard, but I did not have my knees crushed in the seat in front of me. We landed ahead of schedule. We are satisfied with Air Asia, everything went smoothly.",0
Cairns to Osaka. I had booked a low cost flight to Osaka but was informed of a covering list I was due to operate on during the booking. I immediately attempted to cancel the booking and was told I would not be able to rebook the flight. On pressing ok I was informed that the full sum of my booking would be forfeited. Now this was 2 hours after the booking was made. No amount of calling or using the useless electronic chat allowed me to engage a responsible manager. I suggest that anyone thinking of flying Jetstar not bother buying tickets with them and use a different airline.,1
Flew from Hong Kong to Manila. Incoming flight was delayed due to congestion at Hong Kong Aiport. Cebu Pacific ground staff did not properly screen the carry on luggages and as always people take much more than the 5 kg allowed. The extra luggages had to be loaded to further delayed and of course fall to the queue - 2 hours and counting for a scheduled 9 pm flight.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru booked to travel next week. They have the worst customer support, they ignore client when they answer you, they ask you to follow up with them after 5 days. I got problem in my account which was disabled, I contacted their support who answered me after long time them asked me to come back to them after 5 days, although they have all my contact details.",1
SYD-KUL then KUL-SYD. Paid for full premium seats plus meals. Before leaving Sydney I called Air Asia to purchase my inflight entertainment and was advised that due to my seat being a premium seat it came as a package. As expected was not the case when I got on the plane! Disappointing 8 hrs! For the flight back I was advised that there were no entertainment units left to pre-purchase and every plane was only allocated 10! I can see value in economy but not in premium/business class.,1
Flew from KUL-BKI on 27 May 2012. Service is awful. No direction whatsoever from the ground staff. Queue system was a disaster as there's no indication of which line to go to. The monitor didn't help at all and I have a couple going to KCH queuing in front of me and a group going to Kuantan behind me. What a mess. The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle. My flight end up with 2 passengers to Johor and it took them 40 minutes to find that out.,1
"Singapore to Berlin with Scoot. Bad start with one hour delay to departure after boarding. Last row, non-reclining seat allocated despite very early check in. Cabin crew courteous and ever-present.",0
DGT-MNL Seat 1A on 5J626. Flight cost 21 including seat reservation and 20Kg hold luggage. No meal service as it is a low cost airline. On time departure and early arrival for this 1h10 min domestic flight. Cabin crew friendly and full of smiles. A320 new and felt safe onboard.,0
Being a frequent flyer and spending extra in purchasing for priority boarding I see Scoot is not ensuring what is being promised to be delivered. Once the boarding is announced they just let everyone board without checking priority. Give zone 1 for boarding first but no different.,1
"Penang to Bangkok via Medan with Air Asia Indonesia. This was my second worst flight experience ever. It is absurd that they do not offer Fly Thru service for International flight connections. It is absurd how small the pitch is between seats. It is absurd they will fill up an A320, with no one in the exit rows because that costs extra, and kick a passenger who relocated there during the flight, how many advertisements are in the plane and that after collecting our baggage and passing through customs, simply to catch a connecting flight, the Checkin Agent insisted I pay cash for an outrageous overweight bag fee because he didn't feel like entering my credit card information into the computer. This is 2017, I can pay anyone for lunch with Venmo, but paying a major airline for a fee is difficult? Are you kidding me? It is absurd they woke me up to hand me a meal which I did not order, only to realize that the meal was for someone else, so they took the meal away.  Wifi on plane? Advertised but doesn't work. Seat entertainment? Not on any planes. T",1
"Although this airline is famous and known for delays and cancellations, I thought I will give them a try anyhow. My flight leaves at 0850 from Caticlan to Manila and my niece leaves at 1000. I was told that my flight was delayed for 1 hr so I asked the agent at the counter if I could join my niece in her flight at 1000 since my flight was delayed anyhow. She said I have to pay $200 for the change and to me that was unsatisfactory since we will be arriving in Manila almost same time already because of the delay.",1
"Another flawless flight with IndiGo. Returned to Thailand ten days ago and flew from Pune to Bangkok with a plane change at Kolkata. (Layover time about 2 hours.) Smooth check-in (Pune and Cal), smooth boarding at both places, and very smooth and comfy flight with the always-friendly, efficient and helpful cabin crew. On time departure and arrival a few minutes early. I like the use of a ramp in Pune while getting on/off IndiGo planes. So much easier than steps/stairs. Clicked N/A on food and bev, these are available but I have never tried them.",0
Flew SIN-KUL return recently. Booking and check-in process was hassle-free and smooth. However I felt that it could be rather expensive since credit card's convenience fee are charged. Leather seats are comfortable.,0
"Worst. Cebu Pacific send me a message that my flight time is changed from 1805 to 21:50 April 18 2023. No option but to accept. This happens not once but several times this year. Unfair to the passenger. When a passenger change the flight, a back charge almost same ticket price will be applied. When the Cebu Pacific chance the flight the passenger will bear the consequences. I highly recommend not to fly with Cebu Pacific. Choose another airline.",1
I would not recommend using it. Low cost is only a joke. Add ons make them more expensive than the quality airlines like Qatar Airways. Unless you only travel with a handbag it is not worth it to use Air Asia.,1
"Jakarta to Yogyakarta. All the times I've flown with Lion Air it's always delayed up to the point where I have expected that it's going to be late this time around. I was scheduled to board the plane at 5.55pm but the plane got delayed for who knows how long. I haven't heard on whether the plane has arrived or not and it's 7.20 pm now. The most baffling thing is that it's written on the general boarding screen that it's on schedule when it's definitely not. If you have no choice but to fly with Lion Air cause it's the only airline available, never make plans to arrive on time or it'll be ruined like how mine has been ruined. Oh well, lessons learned.",1
"I have just booked a flight from Delhi to Jaipur for next month and had a horrible experience. The website was not working for me, payment was not processed even if you enter your card details, customer service is very poor and no one helps you with solving the actual issue.  I entered my card details about 7 times and it came back with an error, not even knowing if the payment went through. The rest of the time I have tried it didn't even get to the payment stage or it simply didn't even show the flights at all. In these 24 hours, the price of the tickets increased by 25%. I tried to online chat with an agent, however, they had no solution for me and kept telling me to try again. After a while of back and forth, the agent offered to hold the tickets for me and I can log in after and pay for them. After all this, trying another few times the payment  went through and I checked in but they have unchecked me. Apparently I need to present the card used for payment at the airport.",1
"Johor Bahru to Ho Chi Minh. Early morning flight from a small regional airport & with no other departing flights at that time, there was no delay & the plane took off on time. An uneventful flight in general with only a slight delay on landing due to the aircraft being put into a hold because of congestion on the ground.",0
Booked on JQ60 SIN to Darwin 26 Jun for timings that didn't involve a red eye flight. However flight departure delayed from 7.35pm to 10pm and became a red eye flight. My previous trip on JQ64 was delayed almost 2 hours and the one before on JQ60 was cancelled and all passengers bumped to the red eye flight. The flights to Singapore from Darwin have a very bad on time performance and this can be confirmed through the flight status tab on both the Jetstar and Qantas sites. I do not recommend this airline.,1
Perth to Sydney on A321. Bargain fare flight on time and crew very pleasant and professional. Only problem was lack of catering. I sat near the front but they had already sold out of most options as passengers on previous flight had bought it. Apparently they do not restock at Perth and the company prefers to sell out (and disappoint customers) rather than carry adequate stocks of food that could be left unsold. Eat before you board!,0
"Hong Kong to Jaipur via Bangalore. Today in Hong Kong I arrived at checked in online and joined the checkin queue well before the stated checkin closing time of 7.30am, there was a long que. I finally made it to the counter at 8.11am and noticed the only 2 checkin agents were now panicking as the flight due to depart at 8.40 needed to close. Passport and visa were presented, boarding pass printed however the agent then required details of my departure from India, fare enough. I took around 1 minute to pull up those details on my MacBook - a reasonable time frame however the agent in charge elected to close the flight, instructed our boarding passes be ripped up and even though I showed the departure details was met with a sorry flight closed approach and checkin agents walking away. Is that good customer service? Or am I right in saying IndiGo need more checkin agents to process passengers on time?",1
Arrived to the airport for check in with Lion Air we needed some assistance with the visa process for Vietnam and we were basically told there was nothing that we could do but miss our flight and try to switch our flight to another time. We decided to do some research ourselves when we realized there was a way to catch our original timed flight. The crew members were extremely rude and didn't want to help us resolve our problem. Once we figured things out for ourselves and then ran to board the plane we found out the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The lack of customer service and disorganization has made us lose any hope we had in flying with Lion Air.,1
Booked a ticket from Bali to Jakarta departing at 7am. But there is not flight until 10am same day. They sold me a fake ticket. Missed my meeting and lost my money.,1
Traveled from SIN on 30th Aug and I must say I was impressed with Scoot! I took the blue seat (aisle) and found it very comfortable (don't forget your shoulder cushion). Then again I'm only 174cm in height so I wouldn't know about the rest. The only (small) problem was the crew kept bumping into me in the middle of the night when walking down the aisle during service but I wasn't too disturbed. Immigration in OOL is really strict! A staff member insisted on weighing all our bags and charging us for all the excess baggage so beware. Food (biryani) was good albeit small in portion and they have 2 water dispensers in the middle of the plane. Don't worry too much and just enjoy your flight! I would definitely fly with them again and recommend them.,0
We flew from Melbourne to Denpasar and needed to check one bag. I went to ask how much it would cost at the counter and they said to do it online asap. To book it online the cost is $54 if you didn't see the fine print on the website which only said the cost would be greater at the counter you would have to pay $165. For one bag! On top of that absolutely everything else cost money as well. I had to ask for water. I would rather pay the extra $100 and fly in comfort with a regular airline.,1
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. It is a terrible airline; the only thing on their mind is how to charge you more before you fly. They charged us AUD150 for a small carryon pram without providing any invoice after ward and saying they would unload all luggage if we complained further. While you can't expect 5-star customer service from a budget airline, this is way too much to endure. The ground staffs are very rude at Adelaide Airport, giving you the worst experience before a holiday. Never ever again.",1
"The site for checking was down so we couldnt do it online. They closed the check in counter one hour before the flight and left 2 groups of people out. We all lost our flights, the staff was horrible, will never use this airline again.",1
"Worst of the worst. Flights of Air Asia are always retimed and delayed. This airline company don't care about customer's feedback and discomfort. Very disappointing, I don't recommend this to anyone.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya with AirAsia. Above my expectations! Seats, really comfortable, more so than the KLM flight I was on. Food really tasty, served hot, for a cheap price. Cabin crew, really hospitable, friendly and professional. Ground staff, really on time, and on some instances, more earlier than scheduled. Really recommended.",0
"Athens to Melbourne via Singapore. Worst experience I have had flying. I had an 11 hour flight and I wasnt feeling very well, I did not have any cash on me but I did have a visa debit. When the flight attendants where serving refreshments I needed a water but they would not accept my card, I told them I wasnt feeling well and asked for some water and they would not give me any so I had to keep going toilet so I could drink from the tap in there. On top of that my seat would not go back so I had to sit upright the entire flight. I think if the flight is over a certain time for example 3 hours, it should be mandatory to give customers a water/drink at the very least. Very poor service and I will never, ever even consider flying with them again.",1
"Adelaide to Melbourne. Jetstar must be scratching for revenue - the plane was approx 3/4 full but they weighed everyones hand luggage. I was caught when checking bag in I had even upgraded from carry on to 15 kg - it turns out i could have taken some in my carry-on. They dont even give you any over, then hit me $ 15 per kg. I get being strict when plane is full but it was no where near capacity. I was 2.5 kg over.",1
"Chandigarh to Kolkata via Delhi on this Low-Cost airline in late February 2023. Flight arrivals and departures were on time and cabin crew were friendly. The flights have no onboard entertainment and food and drinks are payable by cash or credit card, if you pay cash, they only accept rupee notes. If you pay by credit card you have to comply with compulsory 'dynamic currency conversion', which means that the airline will charge you in your home currency (instead of in rupees). On arriving at Kolkata, we were informed that our luggage had been detailed at the origin because security checks had found a power battery pack (these cannot checked in) in the suitcase. We were assured that the suitcase would be returned to us within 24 hours after security had removed the offending item and store it for us to collect on our return to Chandigarh.",1
Used Indigo BOM-TRV for the first time main reason was no other suitable alternative available. The aircraft was spotless looked brand new and the crew attentive and very polite. Legroom is very limited but I knew that before so I can't complain and for a 2 hour flight I could survive it. Tasty snacks were sold at reasonable prices on board. Flight was on time.,0
Kota Kinabalu Malaysia to Jakarta Indonesia. Value for money. No inflight entertainment. Food needs to be paid for with cash onboard. Terrible option for food. Seat is disaster. Nice airline to take for short distances due to economy value. Future travel will avoid this airline. Prefer Malaysia Airline.,1
SIN-DAR. Fairly good flight. I had an exit seat for no charge. Had to buy food and rent an iPad which was another $30 but I wasn't bothered as it was a 4hr flight. Staff were good at check in and actually called me to check in early on the tanoy. I had a bike with me too which arrived safe and sound. Seats are pretty good overall good value for money but the food and drink is expensive! I would rather fly with Virgin Australia as they seem to be around the same price and the food and extra luggage is cheaper.,0
The air hostesses were very polite and accommodating. They ensured I had a very comfortable flight. Very pleased with their service and would definitely recommend this airlines.,0
"Withholding my money over 4 months on a refund that THEY offered I was offered and accepted a full refund on 16 March. Initially told it would be two months then when two months had passed, suddenly it would be 3-4 months for the refund to be processed. It is now 23 July and my money is still being withheld despite being past the 4 month mark. Useless apologies asking for my understanding when Im over 200 out of pocket mean nothing to me. Other airlines have managed to issue refunds despite the crisis, I cannot think of any excuse for me to have still not received my money back. I would give 0 stars if I could. Not a trustworthy airline. Absolutely shameful and disgraceful airline",1
"Singapore to Melbourne. I suggest you do not take this airline if you go for longer that 3-4 hours unless you are prepared to be yelled at by the stewardess for bringing food into the airplane. While I was eating my food a stewardess came and said to me that she'd let me go this time for eating an outside food, but ""NOT"" next time. I felt the treatment was very unprofessional and unkind. They should have mentioned it before we board the flight. Some of the attendants are rude. Another time I had a bad experience was when I asked some of the flight attendants for my thermos to be filled with some hot water, they refused, and wanted to charge me S$5 for buying a bottle water first, then they will give me the hot water after I paid.",1
They messed about getting us loaded then we missed our departure slot. Flight was meant to leave at 6.10pm and we are still on runway at 6.45pm. It's the same every time with this airline. Absolutely terrible.,1
Singapore to Sydney on June 16 the 1.45am flight. We booked bizclass and were very disappointed. The seats were most uncomfortable and the cabin was extremely cold for a night flight having not flown with Scoot before we didn't get any blankets or pillows so we were unable to sleep. For bizclass we got small water and pringles and a soft drink plus our ordered meal at 8am in the morning. We did not feel we got value for money. The ground staff were good but the plane cabin crew were hidden most of the time.,1
"Melbourne to Bangkok. Very disappointed in the service that I have received from Jetstar. After checking in my suitcases, l was advised that the brand new pram & portacot for my 6 mth old needed to be taken to oversized luggage check in. Flight details JQ17 3:20pm 12/02/2019. l did this, however l noticed that when the female staff member asked for my boarding pass, she then ripped off our labels, that I had printed out when my other luggage was checked, and stuck on different labels. This only occurred as a problem to me, when all my other luggage arrived at our destination and there was no portacot or pram! Jetstar have been contacted and all they can say is that they have no idea where it is! I have had to chase up Jetstar and Melbourne airport where I cannot get a definitive answer! Jetstar have been very unhelpful and dont give a damn! Stuck with an infant in a foreign country with no portacot and no pram has proven to be very difficult thus far!",1
"Melbourne to Bangkok. Check in staff - ridiculously rude, power trip and on the offensive. Checked in as normal no issues, all pretty easy - then whilst walking to the gate remembered I had checked in my medication in my luggage - I had already gone through Passport control so I had to wait for a Jetstar staff to come get me. I am a nervous flyer and find it really uncomfortable unless I can take something to fly. (It is Dr prescribed medication). Was approached by a Jetstar lady, didn't even say hello, just looked at me and said ""what is the problem with a stern face"" ""another winging customer"" I said to her ""hello""she gave me nothing, any way she escorted me back through the gates, there was still 90 mins before the flight was to leave. I went to the Jetstar service desk, carrying my carry on and motorbike helmet. I walked up to a guy to explain my situation, before I could even finish he just started talking over the top of me and said - I cannot take my motorbike helmet on and the bag I am carrying is over 7 kilos. I stated to him, how do you know its over 7 kilos? I was not aggressive but he could tell I was upset. I stated to him can I please get my meds out of my bag so i can fly, he stated and by this time i was surrounded by about 5 Jetstar staff - that it may not be possible and i may have to miss the flight if i was to get it? I stated I cannot fly with out it  he said  regardless of that you cannot take that helmet on board. He grabbed my ticket and saw that i was business, he then stated that I could take it on board but told ground staff to weigh it! No apology no nothing - Absolute power trip this guy was on and horrendous culture for other staff to be surrounding me. I decided to fly with out my meds,  I was extremely nervous I spoke with the co pilot on the flight who was awesome, the cabin crew were great as usual - Jetstar ground staff are rude, arrogant and unhelpful. I fly back from Bangkok on the 5th of March, it will be interesting to see the check in process. Row 2 in business, when the person infront reclines there is more room in an Economy seat.",1
"Flew JQ MEL-DPS-MEL, outbound on a brand new A321Neo, no dramas and the plane flies very quietly. Return on 787 delayed by 1 hour but notified via email, Boeing 787 is showing its age but still a quiet aircraft and loved flying with this bird. In all pleasant experience nothing much to ask for on a 5 hour flight.",0
"I flew LAX-NRT on Zip Air and had a great experience. At LAX, Zip Air does have a separate line for people who book the lay flat seats and they are also now part of TSA precheck. It took a total of about 10 minutes from the time I walked into Tom Bradley terminal to check in and go through security. The seat was exactly what you would get on Japan Airlines business class just without anything extra. If you want anything beyond a great lay flat seat, you do have to pay, but I knew all this since it is pretty clear on their website so I downloaded some TV shows to my laptop, brought my own food and everything was fine. If you're like me and don't care about all the extras a regular business class fare offers then this is the airline for you.",0
Flew Melbourne to Honolulu. Delayed 4 hours before taking off. Missed connections in Honolulu which we then had to pay to get new flights as did half the rest of the plane. Otherwise flight as you would expect. Met people in Honolulu who had travelled in the last week delayed 26 hours out of Sydney and 24 hours out of Brisbane (in fact flown to Melbourne day after to get Melbourne Honolulu flight). Seems a few nightmares on this route for Jetsar at the moment.,1
Kuching to Penang. Flight was scheduled at 7.55pm but was delayed to 8.30pm most likely due to bad weather. Boarding was fast seat was extremely narrow and I was rather shocked about it as only recently I flew with MAS. Flight was very bumpy but this is most probably due to weather. Food was rather tasteless and is not worth the price. The ticket price wasn't very cheap either only about RM20 cheaper than MAS. I would have opted for MAS if MAS has direct flight between these two cities.,0
This was my first flight with Cebu Pacific and I paid to check my bags from Fukuoka and now I am in Indonesia while my checked bags are still in Japan. I was told it would be here on the next flight however the next flight has left and my bags are still in Japan. I am in Indonesia without my clothes and personal items and I cannot get in contact with anyone at Cebu Pacific. I reported it in Manila on my first stop and still haven't received any information.,1
Macau to Manila. This is the fifth time using this airline. Not once on time. Im sitting in Macau airport and over an hour late already. So sick of this airline and how being on time is not their priority. Ive missed one connecting flight already thanks to them. I will be using Philippines Airlines or other airlines if possible.,1
"Melbourne via Gold Coast to Narita. 29th March. Departed Melb at 6.10am and had a four hour wait at Coolangatta airport. Attempted to change the domestic flight to the day before but was told ""this flight is booked as a single booking and can't be changed"". So we assumed our luggage would be checked through from Melb. No had to collect luggage and check in again. Not a big deal but we fail to see why we could not change our domestic flight. The flights were good. Gold Coast to Narita was flight was excellent. The crew was excellent. Very attentive always had a smile. When you fly with a happy crew it does make a difference. Food and beverages were of a good standard. Flying on the 787 was fantastic. The only real negative is no priority luggage collection for Business Class. Can't be that difficult to do.",0
"Worst customer service ever! I never met such awful people, definitely not helpful. We bought the tickets online and paid for them, but when we arrived at the airport they told us we havent paid. When we showed them the receipt, they told us we took to long from the booking of the tickets to the payment and that they could not do anything and just to contact the client service online. We texted them and after 1 day still no answer .. do you think well get our money back?",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu with AirAsia. Poor airline with excessive seat rows and extremely tiny seats. Flights were delayed on both ways with no compensation. Delays were an hour and felt like the delays were somewhat on purpose for the airline to save money. When boarding gates, no personnel came to check details and everyone just stormed into the gate. This is by far the worst experience I ever had on an airline. Only travel on this airline if you like to arrive late to your destination.",1
"Trivandrum to Singapore. There was no on line check in available to start with, which is nerve racking. Service provided by staff was horrible and Food served in the flight is good for nothing. There was no support for Kids meals. There was no pillows provided and the blankets provided were cheap. My wife and son struggled through out the journey, As There was no pillows provided. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and if the passenger sitting in front is use recliner then youre are in real problem as their seat is resting on your knees.",1
Short haul from Delhi to Kathmandu. Clean on time friendly staff aircraft seemed new. Highly recommend Indigo for domestic flights in India or within Southeast Asia. Nothing special but low fares and definitely better service than Air India.,0
Flown on TZ2 SIN-SYD and TZ1 SYD-SIN recently on FlyBag ticket. Scoot's website is user friendly. Check-in at Singapore's Changi Airport and Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was fast friendly and efficient. On board planes 9V-OTE and 9V-OTA looked well maintained. The interior was clean and had a fresh look. Seats are not too uncomfortable with good legroom. However the light and call attendant buttons were too easily triggered by passengers shifting about in their seats. Pleasantly surprised that the cabin staff regularly ensure that the toilets are cleaned and freshened. They seem to put a lot of effort into it which I greatly appreciate as an almost full load both ways result in heavy toilet usage. Captain and first officer spoke very clearly when making announcements something I seldom experienced when travelling with other airlines even full-service ones. Food however is not fantastic and leaves much to be desired. Overall a good experience with Scoot and may consider flying with them again.,0
"Athens to Melbourne via Singapore booked for August 2018. I have wasted a lot of time and am still currently chasing up a refund requested in January upon Scoot deciding to reschedule my flight to 48 hrs later without a reason. The same issue happened to my sister who was scheduled to fly 2 weeks earlier - coincidence I think not. They have taken over 3 months to process and approve the refund, and have now sent to the wrong account so I am having to go through a dispute claim with my bank. Not worth the waste of time or the effort of dealing with unhelpful help-desk staff who force you to play phone tennis with your bank and them to resolve an issue they have caused.",1
In terms of airline value for money for an 8 hour flight from Sydney to Singapore ScootBiz is about the best there is. It was certainly well worth the $139 surcharge (which I paid on check-in when offered the option) on top of the extremely low economy fare. The cabin was spacious and uncrowded and the seats comfortable with plenty of legroom and a fully adequate recline. The food and wine was very simple but perfectly acceptable. Food and drink over and above the initial meal has to be paid for separately but prices are reasonable. Service was good. The flight was on time. Well recommended.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Sydney via Singapore with Scoot. Good low-cost airline for long haul flights, horrible for short haul. While the short haul flight had the least leg space I ever had (it was not possible for me to fit my legs in the row) and was delayed by 2 hours, the long haul flights in the 788 and 789 are quite good. While food and inflight entertainment is not included, the prices inflight for lunch or snacks are fine and the legroom was fine. Service in Changi airport is always top.",0
"The worst flight experience ever. Jetstar cancelled our flight when we waiting at the boarding gate at Melbourne Airport. The reason is engineering problem of the airplane. At first, as the the flight departure is quite close to the departure time and still havent received any announcement about the flight until the last minute. After a while, Jetstar announced that the flight will delay for another 30 minutes to check and fix the problem of the plane but unsuccessful. They gave each of us $10 refreshment voucher to spend in the airport.",1
"The airline keeps cancelling flight especially when the flight date is near. This is without regard to the trouble the passenger will have in rescheduling work leave, rebooking local flight in country of destination, and the expenses of finding another flight from other airlines because their (AirAsia) new flight date will come after 1 month. This happens when COVID cases are already going down and the restrictions already eased, especially in the destination country. The only explanation they can give is ""this normally happens"".",1
"Christchurch to Denpasar via Melbourne. My boyfriend and I left early from Christchurch on Feb 14 looking forward to getting to Denpasar for a 10 day trip. We were delayed in Christchurch for a couple of hours because Jetstar did not have the equipment required by the regulations. We paid $80 each to check in one bag each. When we got to Melbourne, we were rushed to our next plane. We had no time to get food as planned and as a result, spent a lot on food to Denpasar. When we got to Denpasar at around 1 pm local time, our bags did not come off. We waited in the long line at baggage services and were told they had no idea where our luggage was. We were given a PIR number and sent on our way. We have no clothes or toiletries. There absolutely no inquiry about how this would affect our plans or how they could help us. It has been a day and still they have no idea where our luggage is. Jetstar is very difficult to get ahold of and really not helpful. The customer service has been awful so far. We are stuck in a foreign country with none of our belongings and no timeline. I would expect that the airline would contact us (not the other way around), and apologize and give us information at least, compensation for at best. If they were going to rush us to the other flight in Melbourne because of their delay, they should have been honest and told us they would not also be sending our luggage- then we would not have gotten on. It is an awful way to treat people.",1
DMK-PHN-DMK - Not much to write about frankly as this is a low-fair airline. Having their base in DMK airport is a strategic move away from the chaotic Suvarnbhumi. Make sure you booked earlier as the ticket will be almost as expensive as the regular cost airline given booking only a couple weeks ahead. Check-in both DMK and PHN is no problem. Though I seem to have problem with mobile online check-in from my last trip.,0
"Bangkok to London. Will not refund you. If they postpone a flight a refund takes 40 Business Days! Booked from Bangkok to London return. Also, customer service can't do anything to help.",1
My wife and I booked business class Jetstar from Brisbane to Denpasar. Business is little better than economy with the seats in front dropping back into our laps - very little room. Worse was the return flight which Jetstar cancelled a few hours before departure. The email told us to phone an Australian customer service number (our cost) and we were told we had been moved to business on Virgin the following afternoon. When we checked in at Virgin we were told Jetstar had downgraded us to economy. After much argument with the Jetstar representative at the airport where the only options offered were to fly to Perth or Sydney they magically found two business class seats on that night's flight direct to Brisbane. We had to sit around at the airport for 10 hours. This was the first and last time I will fly Jetstar. My advice to fellow travellers is never fly Jetstar. Their client service is appalling and I got less than no value from being a business class passenger.,1
"Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Aside from the friendly staff member who was helping with self service bag drops, staff we encountered did not greet us and did not say how can I help you. My wife and I did not pay additional to get side by side seats for an 8 hour flight. We were told to check with the KL counterparts but we knew that was just an excuse since we wont have time to speak to anybody after the SIN-KUL leg. We did try but the KL staff told us we could not, without checking the flight status nor touching her keyboard. Cabin crew told us to power down our phone. How do our phones still affect planes in 2019? I was told off by a flight attendant for not powering down as a first warning. Dont I deserve some slack as a customer?",1
"Phuket to Melbourne. Booked for 1020pm, luckily I looked at my emails and saw it was not going till 3.30am. We had to book another hotel near the airport and because it wasn't delayed by 6 hours can't claim. They gave us a voucher to get something to eat at a burger place. No chips, no coffee, only nuggets and fish burger and the staff were very rude. We will never travel Jetstar again. We paid top dollar for our trip, dinners, extra baggage etc. We had an awesome time in Thailand but going home just spoiled our trip .",1
"Singapore to Perth. The worst airline we have flown. We knew it was a budget airline, but did not expect to have to pay for Everything, from using our own device to watch entertainment, and did not supply any earphones, our welcome drink into business, was a small plastic container of water. Told we were allowed 1 free drink, asked for a gin and tonic. Told We would have to pay for the tonic water, as that would be Classed as 2 drinks. If we wanted to charge our device to watch the entertainment had to pay $5 to borrow a plug. No tea or coffee after the meal, had to pay $4 if we wanted a cup. Pillow or blanket $5.each This was Scoot biz!",1
"Flying with AirAsia for my first flight Kota Kinabalu to Kuching. The aircraft condition is good as well as comfortable seats. No IFE but it's okay for me seem it just take about an hour flight. The cabin crew are friendly, professional, helpful and provided an efficient services. Flight on time with no delayed. Onboard meals tasted delicious. Ground staff was good just a little bit slow but friendly. Would fly with this company again for future. Great company with great service on board. Well Done.",0
Sick to death of flying with this budget airline. Flights are always delayed or cancelled last minute with no alerts sent to their passengers or respect for our time. Carry on weights are pathetic making a big drama over 400grams over weight.,1
"For a recent business trip, I found Scoot which offered some great Business Class rates for locations that I travel to regularly and decided to give them a try. Because of route limitations (Narita to Hong Kong), I had to piece my flight together by purchasing each leg individually. While purchasing my flights, I found that even though the basic airfares offered are the same as those sold on other travel websites, it is not obvious until you have completed your initial order that everything else is ""a la carte"" with regards to cost. Since I fly Singapore Air regularly, it was nice that an option to count my Scoot flight on my Kris Flyer account, it was ridiculous that I have to pay extra for this feature ($20-$30 extra). But there are a number of things that Scoot's website either fails to disclose, is not well worded or has hidden on some obscure page on their site requiring hours of searching. One items it that their online check in is only available for flights DEPARTING from Singapore. Additionally, I suggest making sure to double and triple check your travel dates and times since their website did not provide me with a flight on the date and time of day that I had requested (requested Fri evening, was giving FRI AM past midnight schedule instead of making it Sat AM past midnight). For the HK to Singapore leg, I found that Scoot offered a nice comfortable ride, fast boarding (Business Class) and fairly good service from the flight crew. Scoot is definitely an all economy airline since additional beverages beyond what was included with the meal were offered even for purchase. Speaking of the meal, unless you like eating what is similar to cheap frozen microwave meals, I suggest as others have mentioned to bring your own food along. Also the flight crew do not remove the plastic cover before serving you so make sure to drape your napkin across your clothes to avoid splattering yourself. At least the flight crew were nice and friendly and were dressed like flight crew's from the 50's and 60's which was a nice change from the stuffy or garish looking uniforms that other airlines use. As for my Singapore to Narita flight, this is when I learned that Scoot's website made an error with my flight request. Like I noted previously, I had requested for a flight on Friday afternoon or evening specifically and did not realize that it had offered me a flight just past midnight on Thursday evening instead of Saturday. So this is where things got really interesting. First, based on the way the website was worded when I attempting to login and make a flight change 2 days before hand that the site said I could not make any changes until 24 hours before my scheduled flight. So I waited and tried to make the change 24 hours before my flight but was still not allowed to do so. Well like any other traveler, I decided to just call and have the change made over the phone - only to my surprise to learn that I was marked a ""No Show"" because the flight I had paid for had already boarded and was about to depart. Unlike other airlines, the Scoot rep rudely told me that the error was my fault and that their policy was to not refund the cost of the flight especially since I was now marked as a ""No Show"" and became argumentative, so Customer Service is definitely not a strong feature for Scoot.",1
Jakarta to Denpasar. Service is terrible. Flight was late for 2 hours. But we were informed about delay 15 minutes before the scheduled departure. Airport staff was just laughing when I tried to get any info about the flight. They didn't understand English. Very terrible company.,1
"Jetstar ruined our holiday. At 3.42 as I was riding home from work (I had left early for our 6:30 jetstar flight to Melbourne) and received a text message that said the flight from Sydney is cancelled. For options told to check email or call 131 538. No explanation, that was it. I rushed home to make the call. After going through all the call options, waiting for a long time (for which Jetstar apolozied but I was waiting and waiting). I was put through to a call centre. I provided all necessary details, again, and the overseas customer service lady tried to appear helpful by saying the cancellation was due to engineering difficulties and that she would try to put me on the partner airline Qantas to Melbourne. She asked me to wait so I waited - and waited for a very long time then, she hung up! Desperate to try to redeem the weekend I called again and went through the entire wait routine again. This time the lady informed that all flights were fully booked but if I could get out to Sydney airport in 8 minutes we may be able to catch the 5:30 flight! By this time it was 4:52 peak hour traffic time and although we live in Chifley, about 20 minutes to the airport with no traffic, this was totally impossible - it was Friday afternoon peak hour! While waiting and talking on the phone I had logged on to the internet to find that there were some available seats on Jetstar flights going to the alternate Melbourne airport, Avalon, same night. I asked if we could possibly be booked onto one of these flights as although it was very inconvenient we would still be able to arrive in Melbourne that night and join other family members who were already successfully travelling to Melbourne from various locations using other airlines. I was informed that if I did this I would have to pay for the flight again as it was not to the same airport and that I would not be refunded. I asked if I could speak to her manager and she said that was not possible, she would read out my options which were to cancel and apply for a refund through customer care which would take 15 days! or she could book me on a flight the next day, 12:45pm was the earliest - a night and day of our 2 day holiday ruined as we had to return to Sydney the next day Sunday at 6:30 pm. I explained and she said all I could do was present my case to customer care. I asked if she could put me through to ""customer care"" and she said she did not have a phone number for ""customer care"" and that I had to go online, email them and wait for them to examine my case (up to 15 days as above). Totally frustrated I asked again to talk to the manager. She said she would put me through to someone then left and again I waited for a long time. There was no response on the line so I called again same wait process and asked the woman not to hang up on me this third time and that I wanted to know if I took a flight that night on their partner airline would they refund me for the flight I had already paid for and pay the cost difference for the new flights, this cancellation being Jetstars eng. fault (there were still seats on these other flights). She could not tell me. I couldn't afford the additional fares so I had to ask her to book me on the 12:45 flight Saturday, only to have to return the next day. We missed out on important family time together. Jetstar you ruined our holiday!",1
"Hobart to Melbourne. As most people that fly with mountain bikes know, they typically come in around 23kg if packed in a commercial bike bag. Most airlines have at least a 23kg weight allowance and typically don't apply any oversize changes to sporting goods. I have flown overseas and intestate with Qantas, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Air Canada with a bike bag weighing between 23 and 24kg when packed and never once had an issue having it checked as my included bag. It has always without exception been carried under the flight's standard included luggage allowance This all changed when I flew the first (and last time) with Jetstar (on the return leg of a qantas flight) Jetstar only allow 20kg (which if you use a good commercial bike bag and have mountain bike you're almost certainly not going to come in under) AND an oversize bag charge that isn't waived for sporting goods like most airlines. This charge along with their $15 PER Kg charge will add about $70 to your flight each way. They will not take into account that you flew out with their partner airline on the same booking with which can lead to some obvious confusion when you cant come back with the luggage you flew out with. To top it of once they know you're at your weight limit the smell blood and really go in for the kill to make an extra buck. On our return flight the resorted to the utterly stupid level of weighing the wallets/purses you're carrying on board (even if they are not going in the carry on). While I acknowledge the whole ""we need to weigh your wallet and purse"" thing was probably just got someone having a bad day at check in it does go to underline the clear culture is making money from baggage charges however possible that must permeate through the airlines culture. So if you're flying with a bike I'd strongly look at using an alternate airline",1
"Recently flew from Melbourne to Bangkok on Jetstar. Let me first say Jetstar is a budget carrier and as a such if expect a full service airline experience you will be disappointed. I always start flights with budget carriers by expecting a ""budget ""experience. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this flight, the majority of things worked well. We arrived early (always wise with budget carriers) and spent very little time with the check in process and all went according to plan as we had paid the extra for checked bags and seat selection. Flight left on time and we had a small but pleasant meal. The only problem we had was my wife had paid for the entertainment and she had trouble with the volume in her seat. It was a 787 which are very good planes, the seats were comfortable and space ok for economy, I have had worse experiences in full service airlines. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would I fly Jetstar again? Yes no problem.",0
"Excellent experience all around with Jetstar from Auckland to Nelson. No check in queue, the staff member at the bag drop smiled and spoke to me. Flight attendant excellent, flight on time with no hassles at all. Baggage delivery very quick in Nelson. Why oh why can't Jetstar Australia be like this?",0
I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi. The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint. This airline makes changes to suit itself and save money but never makes changes for its customers.,1
"Melbourne to Tokyo Narita return and would say Jetstar is my favorite Low cost long haul carrier. Plane on both journey was beautiful, seat was comfortable, food was very good for me and affordable as well. IFE was fine though dissapointed as not much selection, still ok to keep me entertained on the close to 10hr flight. Was a good experience for me as well to try the Boeing 787, very nice and quiet aircraft. Would definitely fly them again on their international routes as thier prices are very reasonable.",0
Sydney to Ayers Rock. Filthy. I travel all over the planet with a backpack and small bag. Never have I had to pay $60 to bring them. Unbelievable scam. I'll never fly with them again.,1
"Manila to Singapore, booked to travel in January 2018. Customer service does not exist. I've been trying to call the customer service in Singapore, Philippines, Australia, and any countries I can try. No one picks up. Every time I get a classic machine voice that everyone is on the phone (on several occasions!). I tried sending a feedback through their online form. I tried to complete every single field, and by the time i click on ""submit"" it says that I have not entered on the ""Case Category / Type Field.",1
Singapore to Penang return. Worst Customer support I have experienced with any airline. I had to cancel my tickets due to the coronavirus outbreak. After trying multiple times and waiting for more than an hour on the line I was never able to get through to their customer support staff. Extremely disappointing and poor service.,1
"Short flight from Singapore to Kuching, midday flight on a Sunday. Flight was more than 50% empty, so obviously the overall experience was better. Boarding was on time and efficient, and crew were reasonably pleasant. For this short flight, I had paid for the first row of seats, and so legroom was aplenty. The A320 had obviously seen quite a lot of service, seats were clean but felt like the cushions had sagged a little. Halfway through the flight, was impressed that inflight connectivity (rokki) allowed reading of the AirAsia inflight magazine, brief travel guides, news and simple games on iPad, all for free. Impressive for a no-frills airline. Flight landed on time, and disembarkation was fuss free. If seat comfort was a tad better, this would be a 5-star low-cost airline flight.",0
Jetstar are the worst company I have flown with. We are on our honeymoon in Vietnam and I decided to book with Jetstar Pacific because I viewed them as a more reliable alternative to the other economy airlines in the region and also because of the flight times. However they have been completely disastrous changing the days and times of all our flights (some on multiple occasions) up to 2 days before the flight. This has meant we have had to completely change plans cancelling hotel bookings as well as all the stress that goes with it. I will never fly with them again.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Manila. The first flight to Malaysia was fine, no problems. The return to Manila was terrible! I am 6' 2"" and I had no clearance for my knees.  This was not a planned trip. I have been in Philippines for 3 years and had to leave, for a silly rule. and come back again, so it was just a quick trip, away and back. For an international flight the seat configuration was uncalled for.",0
Mumbai to Bangalore. This is the second time I'm booking Indigo from Mumbai and both times the flight was delayed. The scheduled take off was 1545h and take off was 1725h for the flight. Both times I've missed being where I was supposed to on time.,1
"Ahmadabad to Mumbai. Total chaos, paid for extra luggage but receipt printer not working. A girl trying to fix but she has no clue how to fix? Asked to wait 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes but printer did not work, she filled up manual receipt and handed over to me, by this time already running late for flight, she allowed 2 small carry on but  supervisor did not allow at security checkpoint, now I have to start from square one, scan bag, bag drop off. A girl at bag drop off wants to charge for extra luggage but printer is not working and I am running out of time, supervisor came, things did not work, bag was checked in without any charge. I rushed through security, heard my name announced on PA, before last call rushed to boarding gate.",1
"Actually I'm flying AirAsia Indonesia, the first flight of the day. Ground service is normal, quick check-in and baggage drop although when entering boarding gate (is it normal at CGK, one boarding gate could serve 2 different flights) did not put clear signs indicating which queue lines were for which flight, some passenger queued in the wrong line. Delayed take-off due to runaway congestion and bad visibility (maybe) but we still landed ahead of schedule. Food, I ordered Chicken Kungpao with rice and it was just bad. The rice and chicken were super dry, sauce too watery and taste like soy sauce. Not what you expect of kungpao chicken.",0
"Sydney to Launceston. Such a poor experience with this airline, not only were we waiting in the baggage area for 40 minutes without any explanation but we were then left to go home without our luggage. The lack of communication was pathetic and to not have a replacement piece of equipment to remove baggage from the aircraft once the first failed is just pathetic. Yes they stated that the baggage would be delivered once it was removed from the aircraft within two hours, another fib, poor, very poor!",1
"On 09 November, I had requested a wheelchair for my mother, who was travelling from Singapore to Melbourne, on 04 December. A confirmation email was sent by them on 13 November, stating that the request was added to the Scoot booking was promised at Singapore Changi to provide 1, during check in. Never came. Arriving Melbourne, also it was not provided. to take note: They made my aged mother, who has difficulties in walking long distance, walk all the way from the check in counter to the aircraft in Singapore and walk from the aircraft till checkout in Melbourne. I chatted with one staff on the chat option from Singapore. Said she will ""escalate"" the matter immediately and I will get a reply in 3 days. I called Scoot Melbourne, after the chat with Singapore Scoot, to ask if this will be done in Melbourne. Gave me an excuse that it is done by the ground staff. Informed them that Scoot was the one who promised this, and it was their responsibility to get one. I kept repeating myself so many times. It was clear that the person speaking to me on the phone was lacking the understanding language of simple English. Once again, the same incident happened in Melbourne. No wheelchair. After waiting for 2 weeks and having no reply from them so called ""escalating"" the incident, I decided to chat with them again. Same response ""escalated the matter"" and they are investigating! Unfortunately, we have a return to Singapore via this airline on 28 December 2023. Till today, being 26 December 2023, I have received no replies. Clearly proves that it is definitely a budget airline. Never ever making this mistake of booking Scoot!",1
"Airline staff very rude, not able to help and cannot check in luggage to the final destination. I am flying international and will have to pick up luggage in the connecting airport and re-check, running a risk of missing the connection. The ticket was purchased with Air Canada and included the whole itinerary. It is an airline that is not connected to any other and have very strict rules for checking in and boarding with very rude and unhelpful staff at the check in counter. Will never use it again",1
Air Asia at first glance looks like a great deal but beware! As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic! There were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it never mind the danger to the children! In-flight entertainment? None. Spend the extra and fly a real airline.,1
SYD-HNL Star Class. Typically poor experience on Jetstar. Exceedingly long queue for business class check-in of 45 minutes they were checking in 3 flights using only one counter for business class. Several agents standing around doing nothing. Inflight experience leaves a lot to be desired. Star class bears no resemblance to international business class standards. Seats are much more akin to US domestic airlines first class seats with limited recline limited legroom and a worthless footrest. When the passenger in front of me reclined my knees were jammed against the seat. I measured 6 inches of space between the seatback and the front edge of my seat. Do not be fooled into thinking this class is a bargain at any price. Cabin service was cool and indifferent. Cabin attendants served meals and disappeared for the rest of the flight. Certainly not worth the money and extremely poor value.,1
"I flew ZIPAIR from LAX in Los Angeles to Narita airport in Japan on 11/1. I had arrived a few minutes after the one-hour boarding deadline had passed. To my surprise, the friendly counter lady was able to check me in along with my two luggage cases and said I was fine with being a few minutes late. Obviously it wasn't my goal to be a few minutes late, but crazy traffic at LAX was the issue here even though I left my home 3 hours before my flight. The flight was smooth with no turbulence and the food was pretty decent. The movie library is pretty limited (only 9 movies), but enough to pass the time. The nightmare started to happen during my next leg of the trip (flight purchased separately) which was departing on 11/4 at 8:55AM from Narita airport in Japan to Incheon airport in Seoul. I had arrived at the check-in counter at around 7:53AM and was concerned about the one-hour boarding deadline. The counter lady was busy assisting another individual, and my wife and I were the last in line to be checked-in. The lady finished the other individual around 7:58AM and as I was heading to speak with her, she said I could not board because the hour deadline had passed. As you can imagine, I was livid and told her that it wasn't my fault she took so long to assist the passenger before me. I said it was not my fault as I had arrived at the line before 7:55AM. We had several back and forth encounters as you can imagine I am out several hundred dollars and she told me I had to book another flight since there were no more ZIPAIR flights leaving Narita that day. She was not helpful at all as I asked how to inquire for a refund. She said you'll get the taxes back. I then asked how do I do that? She said to contact customer service. I asked how do I do it? She said there's no phone number, you'll need to email them. I literally had to ask her questions by piecemeal. This was by far the rudest person I have come across after traveling to Japan several times this year. I will seriously question myself if I was to fly with them again.",1
"Singapore to Sydney. I will definitely fly with Scoot again. A last-minute booking, only S$220, excellent plane. Although a 'budget' airline, many other airlines could learn from this company. The plane is very suitable for long haul. I did not purchase the food options so cannot comment about them. The plane was not full so there was plenty of space; however, even if the plane was full I believe that I would have had a comfortable flight.",0
"Ive flown with Jetstar many times from Melbourne to Pert to visit my partner and yet I havent learnt my lesson. Almost every flight has been cancelled with less than 5 hours notice. The most recent for a 6am flight but youre unable to choose a reimbursement flight online so have to wait until 6 when the call centre opens. The only one they didnt cancel, they managed to leave my bag behind in Melbourne, needing to put it on a Qantas flight to get it over there. Theres an obvious reason its the cheaper subsidiary of the Qantas group.",1
"Every year, my daughter and I would travel during school holidays, this year we chose to travel to Singapore. After checking, I noticed Scoot was a couple of hundred dollars cheaper compared to another major airline. So I booked Scoot and booked only 1 luggage for me and my daughter. A day before our flight, my daughter said she might need an extra luggage so I went to the Scoot website ""Manage My Booking"" Section to purchase an extra luggage allowance. It took me half an hour to get to my booking details because the website could not find my booking reference. Finally after getting to my flight details, I added an extra 10kg on top of my luggage allowance of 20kg and paid $34. I also paid $24 to book our seat numbers. I tried to add meals in our booking but the website said meal booking was not available at that moment. Finally on the day of our departure, 15th January 2016, we went to Sydney airport and the check in guy said our luggage was over the 20kg allowance and I said I booked an extra 10kg the night before. They said there was no extra 10kg booked in our flight and that I have to pay $140 extra for the excess weight. I asked them to double check because I know I paid for it the night before. The woman said they see an extra 10kg booking for our return flight. I asked there was a mistake and if they could fix that problem and apply the extra 10kg allowance for this flight. The woman said in a firm tone there's nothing they can do, I have to pay the extra $140.  Before boarding  we bought a couple of bottled water and after take off I pulled a bottle water out of our carry bag but the flight attendant told us we are not allowed to consume any food or drinks we have with us. I said my daughter is thirsty and the flight attendant told us we have to buy water from them which cost $4 for a very small bottle of water, and we waited for at least 15 mins for the bottled water to be given us. An hour after later, the flight attendants started serving meals to those who were successful in booking their meals. I asked one of the flight attendants if I could buy food and she said we have to wait. We waited for more than half an hour before she came to take our order. I ordered a wrap and she asked me if i wanted it warmed up. I said yes, and after paying it took another 30 mins for the food to be served to us. I was observing the staff on board and I noticed they keep on asking each other and they all looked confused.",1
Lombok to Kuala Lumpur. The luggage fees are outrageous. Airport security tell us we cant take a tripod. The baggage people should be aware of what we can not take with us.  Will never be flying this airline again.,1
"Short hop from KL to SIN with Boeing 787, quite comfortable. Lots of thunderstorms on route, looked very dramatic but actually we did not experience major turbulence. Long stopover in SIN (could get out of the terminal and take a hotel in the city) and next day flight to Manila. Booked meal service, which was ok (nothing really memorable) and emergency exit. Both at acceptable rate.",0
"Singapore to Jakarta. Having read a number of negative reviews of Scoot, I have to say that people are obviously missing the point. Yes Scoot is a budget airline, you pay for every extra, but having been a Scoot passenger for over 3 years, flying from Singapore to various locations in ASEAN, I cannot fault the service. Yes, flights are occasionally late, but that happens with every airline now and again! Reasonably priced tickets, even cheaper if you book far in advance,  you pay for what you want to use, and if you don't want it, don't pay, simple as that. As for the comments about being pregnant, any sensible person would have obtained a letter from their doctor prior to the flight clearing stating how may weeks pregnant you are and that your doctor is happy for you to travel. As long as you don't exceed the airline requirements, 32 weeks as per Scoots website (did you not check before you flew?) As for complaints about excess luggage charges, you can purchase additional luggage online prior to your flight, you know if you need more luggage before you get to the airport. The comments about kids not sitting properly and being difficult. Being a parent myself, yes some kids don't like flying, but that does not prevent parents from following the rules of the airline, including bringing non Scoot food and drinks onto the flight. If you want a cheap flight, fly budget, if you want free water, and a great cabin crew, fly full fare scheduled airlines. At the end of the day, its your choice as its your money! Overall, a great value for money, with a normally happy crew of Scooties. Keep up the great service Scoot.",0
KUL-PEN roundtrip on 25-26 December. A pleasant trip especially on the return leg. Aircraft was clean and stewardess friendly. The return trip was better as staff were more friendly and hospitable. Did not buy any drinks or food because it was a short flight. Overall a good trip and will fly them again if the price is good.,0
SYD-HNL-SYD. Seated at the back of the plane. Plane was full but there was enough space. Check in was efficient and flights on time both ways. IFE was the only let down. Very limited range of movies and even though we flew over in Oct and back in Nov we had Nov choices both ways so 20 hrs with only 2 movies I wanted to see out of the limited selection. We didn't buy food but took our own on the plane and this was no problem. Checking in baggage is not inexpensive but if you do it at time of booking it is not too bad. If you follow the rules about booking/ flying with a LCC they are definitely worth looking into.,0
"Air Asia D7316 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing March 12-13. We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say ""yes"" but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said ""No we are a low cost airline"". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos. Loading the plane is a joke. It is basically a stampede to the plane out on the tarmac it is a total free for all on the tarmac.",1
NTL to MEL 13 Jan. Full aircraft. Counter check-in friendly and accommodating granting 3 of us exit row seats upon request. Aircraft clean seats comfortable for 1.5 hr flight which departed on time. Very smooth flight. Advance purchase of tickets meant that the flight was good value.,0
"Absolutely inflexible airline and understaffed. There was a misprint in the name due to auto-correct. I showed 3 different IDs (passport, driver's license from India, driver's license from another country) so that they can correct my name but to no avail. They are completely understaffed and unprofessional about handling the case. It took 40 minutes just to reach the ticketing counter to explain my case and then I was left with over 1 hour before departure. Rather than trying to fix the issue, they were just trying to get more money by asking me to book a fresh ticket. Since this was happening 1 hour before departure, I could not even cancel my ticket. Had they been quick about it, I could have corrected the issue and boarded the flight. But instead, I had to book a new ticket for an airline later in the day and lost money on the previous one too. With a security lapse, I was allowed in the airport(name on ID not matching my ticket). This was surprising in the first place. Rather taking this case to fix their security issues, they were still bent on just asking me to book a fresh ticket. No wonder there is a huge room for improvement. But instead of fixing those, the involved people are just concerned about extracting money from consumers. Absolutely unsatisfied with the situation.",1
"My worst flight experience ever. I travelled with my friends and I wasn't checked in, whereas my friends were. On being asked why, the guy at the counter said that the plane was downsized and there were no more seats! Just think of that! My ticket was already booked and confirmed way back in October. We wasted more than one hour trying to convince the guy to give me a ticket but to no avail. Finally after giving the an ultimatum, he finally checked me in, and can you believe it, there were 7 unoccupied seats on the plane. I'll never recommend Air Asia.",1
Nanjing - Singapore. The crew on board were rude - they were not polite and asked you not to eat anything you brought onboard. The price is not as low as its service definitely not worth it. Some seats were not able to recline and my cup holder was broken. Very uncomfortable flight. I'd rather go to Shanghai next time. Avoid Scoot if you can!,1
Sydney to Melbourne. If you want to make it anywhere on time or have life dependent on getting anywhere then don't use Jetstar. Absolute joke. Flight delayed from 4pm to 6pm no explanation why. Missed my meeting which was well timed 3 hours after my flight was suppose to land. Why have a departure time if you cant meet it. Def will spend the extra money next time and go Virgin cause can't rely on Jetstar. If I could give less then 0/10 i would.,1
PUS-MNL-HKG. Was given the emergency exit row at no extra charge at check-in which was a pleasant surprise. All of the announcements onboard were automated which increased the sense that the air crew were doing their job in a mechanical way. Seats extremely thin but I wasn't going far on either leg. Terminal 3 in Manila quite easy to negotiate. Overall surprisingly good value for money.,0
We travelled from Singapore to Krabi by Airasia Thailand on 29th December 2013. I have to say that I am not pleased with the punctuality of the airline. We were delayed as the flight arrived 20 minutes late from Krabi. Delayed again on the way back to Singapore. However the flight was smooth and seats were comfortable for a low cost carrier. A strange incident happened as we were approaching the terminal in Singapore. We were all ready to leave the aircraft when the pilot announced that we would push back to another gate. The process itself took another 30 minutes. So overall we were delayed by over an hour. But still the flight was very smooth and good.,0
"I flew from Auckland - Dunedin (North - South Island of NZ). I booked the flight and then looked at reviews - which is unusual for me as reviews are important to me. However, I am glad I chose to it this way round otherwise I wouldnt have flown with jetstar. Once I booked I felt like I had made a mistake after seeing all of this bad reviews. I chose jetstar as the timing was great for me and so was the price. About $60 cheaper than air new zealand. I had just flown in from the UK and had checked myself in online and used the self service kiosk at Auckland airport to get the baggage tags. Auckland airport did have quite a long queue. Flights to queenstown, Christchurch, Dunedin & wellington were checking in. But the airport is very small so you wasnt missing anything past check in anyway. Took me around 10 mins wait to get to the front (baring in mind that I was about the 40th behind so pretty fast. The lady at check in wasnt particularly polite. But I was infront of her for less than 30 seconds. Passed me a boarding card and off I went. I know my luggage was about a kilo over too but nothing was mentioned and I didnt need to pay any fee - however, if I did have to I wouldnt have complained and blamed the airline. this is my problem. I know the baggage allowance and so does everyone else!!. Baggage wasnt weighed for cabin, though they said several times that 7kg is the limit. So again, anyone who is over and charged the 60... there are NUMEROUS announcements before check in, and also information online about this so if youre over you have to pay. I dont understand the annoyance. Flight left on time & arrived on time. Pleasant crew, 3 female air hostess and a cabin manager called Dave. Was very nice. 2 females in the cockpit. Nice to hear from the pilot in the air as often when flying with cheap airlines they dont bother to speak to passengers I have found. Plane very clean and modern. I am a very nervous flier and the staff really make a difference to how I feel when I am in the air. This flight team made me so comfortable. I got off the plane and went to the loo. By time I got back the luggage was unloaded and just mine on the belt, so very  fast. You cant pay with cash on the plane - but again there is info on this online so its other peoples fault for not checking. Superb service and fight I will fly with jetstar again in a heart beat.",0
"Darwin to Denpasar. In 40 years of flying this is the worst airline I have flown. Service deals are the most unhelpful, boarding is terrible, very inconsistent with baggage fees and no care or support. I will never fly Jetstar Airways again. It ruined my wonderful trip to Darwin. Fly anyone else!",1
"Jetstar has been a very disappointing flight company, I have booked with them in several occasions, they constantly cancel their flights, and let us know a few hours before. I have had to spend much more money to book new flights last minute from other flight companies to make it on time to other connecting flights. Today I was traveling to Cairns from Sydney and again my flight has been cancelled and the only option they give me is a flight arriving at 11h30 in the evening, once again I'm going to have to fork out money for accommodation. Truly disappointing!",1
Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in friendly and polite cabin crew and new air planes.,0
Booked and paid for Qantas tickets return SYD-HNL. On arrival at Honolulu airport we found out we were in fact flying Jetstar. After taking our seats we were told that as we were Qantas passengers we would be getting a comfort pack 2 meals and 2 drinks. Asked for an iPad each to watch movies but were told we needed to pre-book them. There were spare consoles but they were for the passengers who had paid for them in case they had battery issues! When the meals came around I asked for a water and a juice but was told flatly that I could only have one cold and one hot drink how ridiculous! Cabin service was non existent when the steward eventually came to take our order they had run out of Diet Pepsi with 4 hours still to go in the flight. The best thing about the flight was getting off the plane and getting on the Qantas plane back to Brisbane. What a pleasant change in the staff from glum to cheery. Never again Jetstar!,1
"Auckland to Sydney. I do not recommend Jetstar if you want good customer service. I cannot comment on the actual flight as it hasn't happened yet, but I'm thinking I won't even be getting on the plane. I flew from Minneapolis to Auckland, visiting New Zealand on holiday before I start my working holiday visa in Australia. I do not have any solid travel dates but knew that I had to be in Australia by April 16th. I was told at the ticket counter that I could not board unless I had a flight out of New Zealand. This is my fault as I misunderstood the conditions of traveling into a country via visitor's visa vs. a working holiday visa. I was under the impression I could enter the country as long as I had enough money to purchase a flight out of the country. I had to book my flight at the ticket counter and fast since my flight was about to leave. I booked through kayak.com. I purchased insurance as I was under the impression I could use it to change or cancel my flight if I needed to. Apparently, kayak has their settings set to round trip by default and I accidentally booked a flight out of Auckland to Sydney on March 7th and then right back to Auckland from Sydney on March 8th in less than 24 hours. I noticed this mistake on my layover in Los Angeles and called the airline immediately to try and get a refund for the return ticket. Usually airlines will let you cancel of change your flight within 24 hours of the booking. Not Jetstar. They will do nothing to help me. I've talked to their customer service team about 4 or 5 times and they do not care about their customers. They won't even offer me a refund via voucher. The insurance I purchased to Allianz is a farce as well. The box I checked to purchase the insurance said it covered cancellations and changes to your flight. What they don't mention is that it only covers cancellations of changes if you or your travel companion is injured or ill and you must provide extensive proof of this. I will be contacting my bank to dispute all of the charges and I'm confident they'll get my money back. Jetstar will also be losing a customer.",1
"I've flown plenty of times with Jetstar in the past, but I've had it after this pitiful experience. From the get go rude, incompetent customer service at check, so much so that while the staff member from the business class counter was cross examining me about where I plan to fly to next (I was not flying round trip back to Aus) she managed to send my check in suitcase without tagging it. When she realised her mistake not only did she pretend it was being fixed but when I asked the service counter they said the same - three of them standing around having a gab, not a single one checked anything but they were happy to assure me that it was sorted out. Shocker, my suitcase never showed up and since then the baggage services at Sydney airport have confirmed it was never tagged and never even left Sydney airport. Even though it's still there Jetstar have made zero attempt to locate it, a potential match was found a week ago and I had to send someone to the airport to sort things out for me when it became clear the counter staff aren't bothered to do their jobs. Beware if they actually lose your luggage they have some pretty poor policies so they can pay you as little as possible! Cameras, computers, headphones, phones, ipads etc none of that is covered.",1
BKK-KUL KUL-HKT BKK-HKT. Had booked for my girlfriend and myself to fly from BKK-HKT but had to change plans and flew BKK-KUL and KUL-HKT later on. Fast check-in at Suvarnabhumi at self-check-in terminals but extremely slow baggage drop-off! Flights were acceptable considering the reasonably low prices. No attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers.,1
We travelled from Melbourne to Singapore yesterday. Purchased flights approx 5 months ago on a special. We had seats 1 J and K which are bulk head seats. We have travelled business class with Emirates and were never under the assumption that we were going to get the same level with Jetstar. Some fellow passengers were disappointed with the service but they had much higher expectations. We would defiantly fly Star Class again and I think for the extra it represents good value especially if you can purchase during a sale.,0
"BKK-MNL-BKK with Cebu Pacific. Check in in BKK was poorly organised with frequent queue jumping and a competition to see how many baggage trolleys could be jammed into a 10 square metre space, no control by anyone. Flight departed 30 minutes late but was mostly made up en route and arrived pretty much on time. Completely full plane with not the most comfortable A320 seats. Cabin crew did a good job in getting everything and everyone stowed on a really full aircraft. I'm not sure who was enforcing the carry on baggage restrictions but it wasn't happening, and contributed to the late departure of the aircraft. I don't bother with the fairly dull meal service on Cebu Pacific preferring to bring my own snack and I didn't bother with the Duty Free on either flight - and there's no IFR, so it's a pretty uncomfortable seat on a crowded, not very cheap 3hr flight. Check-in in MNL was an hour, despite arriving at T3 3.5hrs before departure. Flight was pretty much as before. Really not much to choose between Cebu Pac and PAL on this route - T3 is a much better terminal than T2 but PAL seem to have better slot times, less crowded planes and a better 30kg free baggage allowance. Cebu Pac are cheaper to change flights, but ticket prices are a lot higher than a few years ago despite lower fuel costs, so I guess the airlines are maximising their prices on a busy route.",0
"Flight for March 2020 was changed and they offered us a refund which we accepted. Wasnt a cancelled flight to do with covid or anything. Its now been three months since I gave my bank details and was told my refund was validated and still dont have the money back, 15 months since the flight. Also since this point it has been impossible to speak to a human being. Emails sent to addresses we once got replies on are being ignored, they have stopped responding to Twitter DMs. Their chatbot is the biggest waste of time and energy. It eventually gives you a choice to provide feedback and that someone will contact you back during work hours only for you to fill it all out and then be told it cannot be completed due to overwhelming volume. When we check the case status it says in progress despite being told it was validated in March 2021. Other airlines refunded within weeks. Weve been waiting 15 months. I will never fly with Air Asia for as long as I live. When we were getting responses from customer service representatives we were met with hostility or else overly polite apologies which mean absolutely nothing to people such as us who are left out of pocket.  Having the audacity to make it impossible to even speak with a human is disgusting.",1
DEL-PNQ(Pune)-DEL. December 2014. Worst possible time of the year to fly out of Delhi. Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,0
Recently flew Brisbane to Newcastle NSW return. This is the second time I have flown Jetstar (only because I had to) no problems at all. Slow check in outbound but quick check in on return and a short and comfortable flight.,0
The worst airline in the world in terms of customer service. I booked a series of flights 8 months in advance. Air Asia moved one of the flights causing a connection to be not possible. Air Asia then refused to allow me to move the flights to fix the connection conflict they caused and refused to give me a refund. I wonder what happens if I take the flights and get stranded when one flight lands after the connection has already taken off?,1
"The route says Sydney to Melbourne Tullamarine, but Jetstar sent me to Melbourne Avalon. I just got off a Qantas 787-9 flight, and I wanted to fly back to Melbourne cheaply, so I booked Jetstar. Jetstar cancelled my flight to Melbourne while I was walking to the gate, because of weather that had already passed in Melbourne. I can tell you that Qantas and Virgin Australia were still flying, so if I had chosen to pay the extra $100 for a Qantas fare, I would've been fed, and comfortable. But in this case, Jetstar stranded me in Sydney and I had little to no money, and NO help was given. They just booked me on a flight to Avalon for the next day. So, I spent the night in Sydney's International Terminal with np sleep, and no support whatsoever from Jetstar, because I had no money, I could'nt afford a hotel room, and as a 16 year old, it was quite scary. Hotels were booked out because of the Cancellation too. I flew to Avalon the next day, and  Seats were uncomfortable, aircraft was dirty. Cabin crew were not very nice, and service was terrible.",1
"Bali to Melbourne via Perth with Jetstar. They charge you exorbitantly ($150 AUD/piece) for luggage that isn't prepaid. Any luggage after the single piece per person is charged at the rate of $25 (Austr) per kg. They hit you with this when you're checking in and have no recourse. If you protest even minimally, they threaten to deny you boarding. Jetstar also cancels flights without any notice and leave you at the airport with no reasonable alternatives. They cancelled our Dec 28 flight and offered to book us a new one in 4 days time! We of course lost the first night's deposit ($320 AUD) we had placed on the hotel that we were then forced to cancel. The promised refund for the cancelled flights has not yet materialised. Be warned.",1
Sydney to Athens via Singapore. It was a great series of flights with a stopover in Singapore of about 8 hours. I spent the time in the business lounge at Changi Airport.,0
"Had a flight from Bangkok to Osaka cancelled during COVID. They gave a partial refund but the rest remained as a voucher.  However, using the voucher is next to impossible. In March I wanted to go to Krabi but the voucher didn't work. I contacted the airline and explained the problem but they were so slow in responding that I ran out of time and had to book flights at a higher price and without the discount vouchers. When they finally got back to me they asked for my information and then I never heard from them again and they closed the enquiry without informing me. I'm trying to use the vouchers for another trip. I'm about a week away from when I need to fly and I still haven't been able to book flights because their customer service is so awful. I contacted them months ago via email (after they hung up on me on the phone twice!) and they asked me for my information again. They have so far confirmed that I have vouchers but haven't given me any way to use them either during booking or after booking. Once again I've waited so long that the flights I wanted have disappeared and I'll now be paying a higher price for flights I didn't want. The only way to contact them now is though their terrible online chat which never understands my question. I've managed to get in an online queue but I'm number 99 and have moved one place in about 30 minutes.",1
"We booked a flight to Bali and paid crazy money for a 5 day trip. We couldn't check in online so therefore got the airport 2hours prior thinking we would have plenty of time. We were in the line for check in for approximately 1 hour 20 mins as they only had 2 people on the desk. it was announced that our flight would 99.9999% not be flying on the 20th. 15minutes later we were told the Flight is rescheduled to the next morning as the cabin manager was unavailable. We got a taxi to a hotel and paid to stay there for the night, we got a taxi back to the airport for an 8am flight. We boarded the plane. The plane backed on the runway at 8.22am and the captain said he had to return to the gate at 8.30am due to an engineering issue. Waited on the plane at the gate until 8.37am and the captain announced there was a stick stuck in the door. The engineer is to remove it and file a report. The air hostess Announced the stick was removed and door closed at 8.46am. The flight took off  56mins late. Overall, it put a damper on our little getaway. We both lost a day of work, paid for extra taxis and accommodation and food for the night we had to stay. We lost our money on accommodation in Bali for the night as it was not refundable. We were very upset and angry overall. Very poor service for a very expensive flight! I would not recommend using them at all.",1
"New plane with slightly spacious toilet. Nothing is included in the fare except the seat. Wifi is provided but spotty. Some devices cannot connect despite repeated tries. No free water. Poor choices of meals payable. The air stewardesses were curt to me, spoke limited English and told me outright no change of seats even though there were empty seats and we were allocated seats next to a giant who occupied 1.3z of a seat. One passenger could sleep over the entire row as there were 2 empty seats next to her. When we asked why she could occupy 3 seats when no change of seats was allowed the air stewardess loudly declared she is sick. I was queuing outside an occupied toilet but miraculously the stewardess manually opened the lock to allow a man with baby to pass me and the queue behind. So the toilet was not occupied why lock it and made us wait?",1
"Indigo is not an airline fit for international travel. 1) The seats were very very uncomfortable, with very little cushioning. It felt as if one is sitting on a hard bench. 2) No in flight entertainment facility 3) No blankets or cushions available. 4) No alcohol served. 5) Food served is pre-packaged poha, noodles. Anything extra is supposed to be paid for. 6) The ground service was slow and understaffed. They had no clue about how to manage the crowd. 7) The washroom didn't have toilet paper a they ran out of it. Not recommended at all.",1
"This is by far the worst airline I've ever travelled with. They are horribly disorganized and cancel flights. They deliberately make everything difficult and customer service is the worst. You try their online chat and the agent disconnects and doesn't reply. Over and over. You literally can't change a flight with them, but they can cancel you with no notice.",1
"I flew Bangkok to Singapore return on 26 January and 5 February respectively. Scoot uses Bangkok's older Don Mueang airport (DMK) which is slightly closer to the city centre than Suvarnabhumi airport and smaller which means a shorter trek between immigration and the boarding gates. I was not able to do an online check-in in BKK (which may not be an option out of BKK) but was able to do so for the return flight in SIN. I arrived at DMK about 90 mins before departure. There was barely any queues for check-in. After the online check-in in SIN, I was prompted to print my boarding pass which I did but there are many self-service stations near the Scoot check-in counters in Changi which prints the luggage tags and also issues boarding passes. Both flights departed on time and arrived at the destinations ahead of schedule even though the flight arriving into SIN was placed in a holding pattern for over 20 mins due to traffic in Changi. The plane from Bangkok to Singapore seems a little older with prominent carpet stains. The plane from Singapore was newer and somehow cleaner. Cabin crew were well trained and did several rounds of checks before departure and arrival. The level of detail to safety is not experienced even in some full service carriers. Announcements were clear and made in both English and Japanese. The seats have excellent recline which is way more generous than the other budget airlines I have flown on this route. Scoot flies the B787 which is my preferred plane compared to the other budget airlines which tend to fly single aisle planes for this route. If I were to fly budget carrier for the BKK-SIN route, I would choose Scoot because it offers better comfort.",0
"The flight is on time and proper boarding announcements and arrangements. The is no IFE. The pre-booked meal was tasty and properly served by Cabin Crew. The seats were comfortable enough for the duration of the flight, but legroom was tight and I found it difficult to stretch my legs. Smooth take-off and landing. Kudos to the flight crew. Overall, very moderate experience with many more ways to improve.",0
JQ 17 MEL-HKT in brand new 787.Business class but seats more like QF premium economy. Departure delayed 90 mins due to tech problem with rear door and storms closing airport. Kept well informed by flight deck. Service by cabin crew very good. Food was pretty good and more than enough for 8/9 hours flight.,0
"Pleasantly surprised, enjoyed the flight. New plane, great crew, full flight. This flight is only 2.5 hours and leaves Darwin at 1.30pm getting into Cairns at 4.30. Pre-ordered meals, fish and chips and toasted sandwich, food was fine and ordered a couple of wines. Scored vouchers also, plus Qantas points and status credits. Flight was on time and check-in at Darwin was fairly quick. Have used Qantas on this route, but Jetsar better with daytime flight. Able to use Qantas Club beforehand, handy for a drink before flight. Have since been on this flight again, will review later.",0
Flew BKK to Singapore with Thai Air Asia. Another bus to the plane. Lot's of empty stands but I think the Airbus and stand do not match. They boarded the bus by row numbers but this soon turned into a free for all. Staff friendly and the normal service standards of a budget airline. Couldn't beat the price compared to the full service airlines.,0
"Melbourne to Bali. Flight was delayed by over an hour for no specific reason. Apparently there were issues. Prior to my recent vacation, Ive also flown with Jetstar and every time it has been unpleasant. Id recommend just paying a little more and going with something more reliable, punctual and comfortable. Beyond frustrated",1
I flew with AirAsia in May from Bandung to Pekanbaru. Overall pretty good and smooth flight. However there is a bit of chaos at the time of the boarding because it coincides with Lion Air to Surabaya at the departure gate only existing in Bandung airport.,0
"Singapore to Jakarta. Obviously this 5 years old aircraft has seen a better days. First step into this aircraft, the cabin smells. Sit at 34A, but someone sat there before I get there, approached the Crew member, he is happy to switch another back window row for me and also alert the passenger that sat at my seat. Crew service on this flight is good, smile and pleasant. But the aircraft should retired. The seat is dirty and hard. The front pocket is wrecked and the tray table sticker should be removed ages ago! The seat pitch is very tight, my leg was uncomfortable when touching the back of the front seat, I'm just 5ft8. No IFE or inflight magazine. No meal served, although they have cart service, just a choice of two, a bottle of over charged water and a red bean paste bun. Flight was delay for 15 min. No information about the delay, mid flight and before landing information form pilot. Flying blind mainly. Rough touch down, aircraft part at remote bay and pax transfer to terminal by over crowded bus. No proper sequence for the disembarked hence everyone rushing to get a better seat or stand on the shuttle bus. Overall, not pleased with the airline. I didn't want to use the aircraft lavatory, because before I even open the door, I can smell the strong fragrance of urine behind the close door and when I open it after, the floor and the toilet was wet n sticky.",1
"The short flight from Jakarta to Singapore was typical of Asian budget airlines. No free food, drinks, and no entertainment, but everything went smoothly.",0
Vododhara to Bangalore. Its horrible experience that it is so hot and we cannot sit in the aircraft. Its suffocating and no one is taking any action. They say a few minutes and its got delayed by half an hour or more in horrible heat,1
SIN to OOL in the first week of January 2015. The overnight flight was most comfortable despite an economy seat. Attentive cabin staff and a landing well ahead of schedule. Scoot continues to impress on this sector.,0
"Flew from Taipei to Singapore On ScootBiz class with my 15 month old son and family. Entire experience was ruined by a rude female attendant who went out of her way to make the flight as unpleasant as possible. My son needed to change his diaper mid flight I didn't expect the stewardess to be helpful but she went out of her way to be as difficult as possible. She refused to let me and my husband enter the toilet together with my son. She insisted that I stand outside the toilet as it was ""against airline regulations"" to have more than 3 people in the toilet! I have flown on many airlines non budget and budget with my son and this is the first airline that has made a fuss and been so unhelpful. Do not fly scoot if you have a young child. I will never fly scoot again.",1
"Worst customer service. we were traveling to Manila with my friend. We arrive at the airport 7:20 then they told us that we were already late for our check in for 9 mins and we cannot board - the only way is to rebook our ticket for the next flight and we have to pay for another ticket. We want to talk to a supervisor or anyone in charge but their just sayin its all the same explanation that we will get from the supervisor. They didn't care if you miss your flight or you have to pay for expensive rebooking even the one in the check in counter was worst he just left from the counter. We end up paying on other ticket, then worst part they put us on the last part of the seat. The worst customer service.",1
We had two flights: Flight 5J384 Cagayan De Oro City to Manila then 5J499 Manila to Kuala Lumpur. We taxied out onto the runway we sat there for 15 minutes as we didn't have clearance to take off. Check in was quite clean I was happy to have my bags checked in all the way to Kuala Lumpur. Flight staff were friendly and food wasn't too bad. Arrived in Manila on time. Departing for Kuala Lumpur proceeded straight through to immigration and then to the gate. I love the convenience of international and domestic being at the same terminal that was the main reason I choose Cebu Pacific for my flight to KL. Food selection was quite bland onboard. Arrival into KL was on time a little early. It is a shame they land at LCCC but you get what you pay for. Overall Cebu Pacific for the price stood outt. I would recommend them based on what I paid.,0
Flight from DUM-MNL on a A320. Nice flight without problems. The crew were really nice and polite.,0
We flew Jetstar Perth-Singapore-Hong-Kong and back in August / September 2013. All aspects of the check-ins and flights were good and no problems. The cost of the flights to and from HK were exceptional value. I read reports about the lack of on- board services - take your own water/food and in-flight entertainment along and you will have nothing to complain about. We regularly fly Jetstar and have never had a problem.,0
"Taipei to Seoul. The terminal number was not clear on email ticket. Result was going to the wrong terminal. Long queues at check-in resulting in getting to the ticket desk between 0 to 8 minutes beyond check-in time. Check in staff simply say ""check-in closed"". Refusing to offer assistance or allowing passengers without check-in bags to receive a boarding pass.  Overall very unfriendly staff. Not able to reach Scoot by phone. No offers for a replacement flight. Will not be flying Scoot again.",1
"I travelled to Bali, Indonesia from Fukuoka Japan and paid for my luggage the checked on. When i arrived the Bali, Indonesia I arrived without my paid check bags it was left in Fukuoka. It took Cebu 5 days to return my luggage to me during that time i had to buy clothes and hygiene items. To retrieve my luggage i had to commute from Gili Trawagan Island to the airport in Denpansar. I would like my refund for the check bags, compensation for the money I spent in Indonesia for Clothes and Hygiene Items, and a refund for my travel cost to travel to the airport to retrieve my luggage. In total its a reasonable price of $312USD. I have sent it all forms and receipts of everything purchase due to the loss of luggage. I have done this over 14 times with Cebu through the Facebook message as well as the email but each time I am told i will get and update in 48hrs but every 48 hours i and redoing the same thing and have the same conversation with a different representative. Cebu keeps running me around.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. For a flight time of 1 and half-hours, the flight already delayed by 2 and half hours without any formal notification provided. No complimentary service offered. Worst flight taken to date. Never choose Jetstar ever again.",1
JQ35 MEL-DPS on the 787 Dreamliner. Paid for the exit row well worth the money. A good service and a really nice comfortable aircraft I'm not sure why it's getting such bad feedback. As my first international Jetstar flight I was satisfied.,0
My family and I flew BKK-KUL KUL-SYD. Awful experience staff were rude no attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers.,1
Value for money! Paid for the extra leg room and it was worth the extra. The food was simple. Suggest passengers eat a good meal before boarding and take snacks. Suggest passengers take a warm jumper or rug because it can be a bit cool. Cabin staff were smartly dressed and friendly. Take a book Kindle or other entertainment.,0
If not for the efficient Soniya at ground staff I would have not made it. Also the onboard team make this budget airline at par with the international carriers. I think there is a reason why people relate with indigo as a national carrier.,0
"Flew Jetstar from Melbourne to Denpasar. The coldest plane I have ever been on, I was pretty warmly dressed in jeans, jumper, boots and socks, and was still absolutely freezing. I asked for a blanket which I was told was 15$ so I asked if they could turn off the A/C as everyone was wearing hoods/scarves around their heads etc and the flight attendant tried to tell me it was 25c! It was well under 20. We also took off 1.5h late due to faulty cabin lights and were on the plane the whole time, no offer of water or anything. It wouldn't be so bad if this ""budget"" airline had prices to match the service/quality but it doesn't.",1
My family of three traveled from Manila to Sydney. We were delayed 2 days in Manila and were not informed when our flight will be until the last minute. They put us up in a very nice hotel in Manila while we were waiting. The morning of the flight they decided to take everyone to the airport at least 3 hours before the flight. I guess they were going for the Guinness book of records for the longest queue ever. Because they didn't start checking people in until all the bus loads had arrived. Little did I know this was a sign of what was to come. We had to change at Darwin to a connecting domestic flight where we arrived about 1pm. As our connecting flight was not there yet they put us up in a hotel in Darwin. We had to wait in a queue in Darwin 3 hours for our new tickets. That plus the 2.5 hours we had to wait in Manila plus an hour at the hotel. All this waiting in queues with a 12 month old infant. The flight from Darwin to Sydney left about 2am. A family we made friends with while waiting in the queue suffered worse than us. They were put off the plane at Darwin because their baby had eczema around it's mouth. Wasn't the whole family just the father and 3 kids. Mother was waiting for them in Sydney. The pilot said the family was removed because the child had an obvious illness. I witnessed the whole event and the pilot never left the cockpit. Anyone that has had a child with eczema would have known what it was. so anyway the family was taken off the plane and left on the bridge. One of the flight attendants coldly carried the sleeping girl and dumped her on the bridge. A memorably bad experience. If you have a family don't fly Jetstar. They also promised to give us $200 worth of coupons each for future flights which turned out to be $50 when we tried to get them.,1
"Airline changed our flight by 3 hours - 3 days before our flight to Male. We were unable to make our connection flight to our much awaited resort holiday we we booked 6 months in advance, the best the airline had to offer was offer a next day flight or a different flight with a longer travel time by more than 6 hours, our stay was cut short by this stupid airline. Will never be flying with them again. Customer service manager utterly useless. All foreigners please stay away from this scam airline - unreliable",1
This short flight was great. There is no IFE and you have to pre order or buy your food. Food is in small portion and high prized. The crew is very friendly and very professional. Of course Boeing 787 is great but you have to pay for plugging in your electronic equipment (unless you are in Biz). They provide paid WiFi (unless you are in Biz) but is slow that is worthless.,1
"We bought ticket for Cebu to Coron for 18th. In bohol government said for a lock down to Manila. We went to Panglao airport to change our ticket for Panglao to Manla. But your staff sad its impossible because flight will be cancel, it will be refund but it hasn't. I want my full refund.n Pangloa they sad 15th will be flight to Manila and we bought ticket for 15th. It was open on your web site too!you cancelled it on 15th morning! If your flight will be cancel why your staff said will be flight and you didn't cancel it 14th! We went to Cebu with ferry and looked there and missed our flight to stanbul. Your staff said Cebu-Coron flight will continue, but it cancelled too. That flight cancelled too and we want our money!",1
"Lombok to Jakarta. Missed connection flight in Jakarta because plane delay in Lombok. Staff offered no help to try and catch connection. Doesn't want to compensate fees for missed flight. Says I must go back to Lombok to receive compensation. The only reason why we booked with Lion Air was because we had an emergency situation on our hands. Our original itinerary was to fly Denpasar to Incheon via Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines. When trying to get to back to Bali from the Gili Isles, our boat was cancelled due to rough seas so we were dropped off on Lombok. With no viable way to catch our flights out of either Denpasar or Kuala Lumpur, decided to book with Lion Air to Jakarta to try and catch a flight to Seoul. After booking, we repeatedly asked the staff if there would be a possibility that this flight would be delayed and their response was no. So we booked a separate connecting flight from Jakarta to Seoul. When it was time to board in Lombok, an announcement says that our flight is delayed 1.5 hours. We ask staff Lion Air staff if there is anything they can do to help us when we land in Jakarta to make sure we get to our connection and they just give us this certificate of delay paper. Fastforward to landing in Jakarta with 20 minutes until our connection leaves, no one seems to want to help us catch it. So we miss our connection and get stuck in Jakarta for 24 hours. Next morning we come back to Lion Air customer service to argue for some sort of compensation and manager tells me that if I want receive compensation for anything I would have to go back to the Lombok lion air desk to get it - same company so I don't see why they can't just handle my case in Jakarta. I would not recommend.",1
"So so so bad. Scoot has rescheduled my flight, not once, not twice, not three times but 4 times! I had to skip a meeting and leave one day earlier to make it on time in Singapore. I must have called the customer service 4 times because of the problems they put me through and when I asked for compensation they just told me the usual ""you have 3 solutions concerning a rescheduled flight"". Didn't even offer an additional suitcase or an upgrade. Just to make it clear, Scoot will provide you with 4 different flights for one day, but will cancel it if is not full and just reschedule your ticket, until there is only one flight a day. Just an advice if you are traveling with Scoot, have your entire day available for them because they will treat their customers as if the only thing they had to do was take their flight. Scheduling is apparently not important. Will never ever ever book with this company again. Not trustworthy at all.",1
CHC-SYD-MAROOCHYDORE return in late May / June 2014. Jetstar were almost obsessive about punctuality and to their credit these 4 flights were either right on time or earlier. The aircraft were all clean staff appeared friendly and helpful. Most enjoyable flights that met my expectations. Only thing is the seats are nearly always so hard that my backside becomes numb. Thousands of pax sitting for hrs on these seats soon destroys much of their cushioning. I never buy onboard. Bring my own food and bottled water. Here in New Zealand we regularly travel CHC- AKL-CHC and only use Jetstar. Punctual good fares and we are always satisfied in every way. They are a popular well used airline in NZ and vital competition for Air NZ. Overall satisfied with Jetstar as an airline.,0
"Been waiting for something, anything from Airasia since they canceled my flight. What a joke around and around with absolutely no result no return contact, nothing. BIG Loyalty Program member for years? Nothing more than a farce. I've been a long time user of this airline, 24 flights alone in the past couple of years but never again.",1
"I now see all the same reviews like mine. AirAsia is a thief. I asked for a refund following the pandemic which they accepted in March 2020. They have been going round and round saying it's in progress for months. Then closed my case with no refund. Thieves, liars, no compassion. Never ever again I will buy a ticket with them and you shouldn't either.",1
"Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore, and the only reason I chose Scoot was the low airfare and I was pleasantly surprised. The plane was clean and sleek. Comfy-ish seats (I'm only 4'11 so leg room isn't an issue for me). The cabin lights were multicoloured. The staff were friendly and smiley. Perhaps because they had comfy looking black and yellow polo shirts/dresses (albeit a little Star Trek like). Not overly efficient with food/drink - they practically ran past with the trolley and if you didn't make eye contact you weren't getting anything. For the price though, and arriving in one peice; I'm taking that as a win.",0
"Very terrible service. We bought a checked baggage and asked their team member if we can checked this bag in the luggage or can we take it in with us as a cabin carryon. She said you can take it with you as a carry on as it is only 10kgs total. At the gate they said you cant take it in as you bought a checked baggage not the carry on. She charged us AUD 75 and she kept saying it is non compliant. After charging AUD 75, we still took the same bag with same weight in the carry on baggage.  Their service is pretty bad. We paid $40 before to upgrade our luggage and their team member gave us the wrong advice and we had to pay for that. They dont take any responsibility of their behaviour towards the customer.  I knew the difference between checked baggage and carry on baggage. Your staff gave wrong advice and due to that I had to pay additional $75 which was a rip off due to your staff mistake.",1
"Singapore to Krabi and return on Scoot. Despite being ""low-cost,"" ticket price similar to full-service affiliates Silk and Singapore Airlines on comparable-length routes. A320 was an old, ex-Tiger aircraft with extremely limited seat pitch; I'm only 178cm and my knees dug into seat in front of me. On both legs the aged leather seats had an omnipresent, unpleasant, and distinct smell. On-board entertainment non-existent. On-board food laughably expensive; $15-20 for just a standard economy class size economy main-dish without any accompaniments. Hand luggage policies strictly enforced on KBV-SIN sector, but boarding efficient. Crew a far cry from competitors and were practically invisible. Both flights departed on time, though return was still a bit late. Punctuality is all you can reasonably hope for when flying low-cost airlines, but given the high cost of the ticket, I still didn't feel I get what I paid for. You can't expect much when flying a low-cost carrier, but Scoot falls far below even its low-cost competition - and it has plenty in the region. It's striking that the same group that does full-service so right at Singapore Airlines can do it so wrong at its low-cost subsidiary Scoot.",1
"No meal for a 10 hour flight, we had a huge delay (4 hours) with no help from the company to take connecting flights, horrible service and everything looked cheap and not taken care of. No information about the whereabouts of the aircraft or the whole waiting time was provided with time. Overall, horrible experience, personnel was nice though but the whole attendance and communication was a mess. Never happened with any other company and just offering an apology is not enough for losing 1 extra flight. Cebu Pacific is an unprofessional company.",1
"Ive been flying with IndiGo for many years now, and thinking to switch to other airline. On 5th Jan 1650 flight 10F seat experienced Cabin crew is very arrogant. While web check-in tried to book meal but it was not giving option so cancelled it. In flight crew offered me sandwich for which I asked if they have alternative. She said you have booked it, so explained her. She said take it or leave it. No beverages or even water was offered. New crew is really pathetic.",1
Star Class SYD-HNL-SYD 5/7/2012. Being bumped from the allocated seat I had purchased 6 weeks before my flight. I took my 86 year old mother for a family holiday. Because she is frail I am 190 cm tall and my wife needs to care for my 8 year old son we delayed our holiday for several days in order to secure the 3 aisle seats we needed. Can you imagine the humiliation I suffered in front of my mother and other passengers when after we had taken our seats the ground staff came into the cabin and demanded I move to a middle seat or else the plane's takeoff would be delayed. In order to avoid a fuss my mother agreed to move to the middle seat. However as soon as the meal service ended the passenger who demanded my aisle seat fully reclined the two seats in front of my mother so his 3yr old and 6 yr old daughters could relax. Because the armrests on the StarClass seats are fixed in position mum was trapped in her seat until the next meal service 7 hours later! To be fair the aircrew were great and handled this unpleasant situation very well. I do not understand how an airline can advertise that you can pay for seat allocation and then not honour the terms of their contract. Let alone humiliating myself and making my mother very uncomfortable during the flight. Unfortunately because of the limited number of StarClass seats on these long haul flights we were unable to fly StarClass on the return leg or rent an ipad to entertain my son because they only load 47 units on long haul flights from Honolulu even during school holidays.,1
"Flew AirAsia flight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur return. Flight was delayed due to the traffic, however, we arrived KL only 10 mins after schedule. Cabin was clean and new, just the legroom was tight. Crew were very helpful and the inflight refreshments were available for sale on this short flight, price was adequate. Overall, I enjoyed this flight. Return flight to Singapore. KLIA 2 Check in counter staff friendly and helpful. Flight was on time, cabin was equipped with leather seat.  The AirAsia crew were very helpful throughout the flight. We arrived in Singapore ahead of schedule. AirAsia is definitely my prefered airline while traveling to KL",0
"My flight from Manila to Macau was cancelled 2nd February at 7 pm just as I was supposed to embark. First excuse, the Honk Gong government closed its frontier. Ten minutes later, they said that the Filipino government wont let any plane coming from China to the Philippines. Still, I want to go to China, I am not coming from there. So, what does it have to do with me again? Afterwards, they told me that every company in the Philippines are forbidden to go to China, Hong Kong and Macau. Finally, a good reason, but why did they lie before? Because I was in transit and didnt have the stamp, they put me in a hall. There, they took my passport, a really stressful situation. They wouldnt tell me what was happening and what I could do. I was anxious because the day after I had a flight from Macau to Taipei and from Taipei to Paris. I needed to go to Macau as fast as possible. I was sitting on the floor, hungry, tired and scared of the people of Cebu Airlines. They talked to me, as if they were talking to a dog. I asked if I could call my French embassy with their phone, they wouldnt let me (I broke my phone the week before). Finally, at 11 pm, they came to me and asked me to take another flight to another place. Luckily, I have money, can you imagine someone who doesnt? How would he or she do? I had no other choice than to take a flight to Paris at 7 am.  At 2 am, they gave me my passport back. What did they do with it? Why did they need it? I left this hall of despair right after and finally got to take my plane back home. Guess what, its only after, that I learned that the Philippine airlines wouldnt go to China. They lied to me again. I could have taken a flight with AirAsia to China. Now about being refund, what a swindle! They first didnt understand my request. Because I had received a boarding pass, they thought I got on the plane. Dont they see on their screen that the flight was cancelled? Right now, I am being refund of a modest sum. I am not even thinking about who much money I spend with international calls. Their website is of no use. I didnt catch my flight from Macau to Paris via Taipei because of them. I had to take another flight from Manila to Paris because of them. Cebu Pacific is the worst airline I have ever taken. Their service is no service.",1
"My wife and I was to have flown from Singapore to Taipei on 10 Dec in Scootbiz but we could not as my wife had a road accident in October. I contacted the airline to cancel the booking and to get back a refund (even if partial). But instead of a partial refund, I was given a run-around with one-way emails from Scoot asking for letter from doctor stating she could not travel (which I obtained) but in the end Scoot says go claim from your insurance! What a waste of time doing all that and calling the call centre (put on hold many times)! And I requested refund way back in Oct when the flight was in Dec. And in the end I found out they sold my already paid seats - what unscrupulous greed!",1
"Christchurch to Hobart via Melbourne. International flight and I wasn't aware how bare bones this flight was. The seat was worn and poking me in the back. They charged me an $160 for my bag from Christchurch to Melbourne and another $90 from Melbourne to Hobart. This was the same price as my ticket. My return flight is on Qantas (same price) and they are giving me free baggage. Flight also didn't include any drinks or food or any sort of entertainment. I'd say spend an extra $100 on a different flight and do not fly with this terrible company. Just scamming people. Plus, you shouldn't have to fly for 4 hours with such standards pend even more to take your bag.",1
"Jetstar Airways flight from Bali to Brisbane. Overnight so no real comment on cabin service. Flew business for a sleep on the trip. Check-in fine, walked into the business class cabin. First thing I said was ""I have flown in a lot of business class cabins and this is the worst I have ever seen, its no more than premium economy"". Food was poor quality, the same as other airlines economy class. Will not be flying Jetstar again.",1
"I had a connecting flight, the route was Cauyan -> Manila -> Puerto Princesa, the flight from Cauyan was delayed but there was more than enough time to check in. So I went to the check in counters C16-29 and used their self check-in service. In the last step of the check in it said it was unable to check in and that I needed to go to the counter. I reached the counter 43 minutes before the flight was supposed to lift off. They closed check in 45 minutes before, so they just told me I'm too late. I explained that the machine had an error and I did what I was told. I had no baggage to check in so it would cause no issues to check me in. She didn't care at all and she lectured me about that this line and machines was for baggage check in, but I clearly saw people use the check in machines with no baggage and there were no other machines to use elsewhere.",1
Auckland to Singapore return. Check-in was quick easy and staff were friendly. Plane was ok seats were uncomfortable crew were friendly and helpful. Did not use any services onboard. Brought my own food and crew removed my rubbish. People need to realise that you get what you pay for as a budget airline I think they did very well. Will fly with them again.,0
Adelaide to Perth. The obsession with carry on baggage weight that includes computer or handbag for a total weight of 7 kilos makes passengers paranoid and uncomfortable just in case they are 1 kilo overweight. This puts unnecessary pressure also on staff. Weighing hand luggage on boarding caused confusion and many customers complain. This is obviously a revenue raiser despite that they are concerned about safety. Get back to reality that's why your ratings are so low. Look at what the best low cost airlines do.,1
Yet another bad experience with Indigo from Udaipur to Mumbai. We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure. We were told that seats were all web checked in so we were forced to take paid seats or sit in different rows. Concept of unregulated extra charges within economy class is wrong. Moreover these are not declared at the time of booking tickets.,1
"I paid for ""premium"" and couldn't even use self check in. Nearly missed my flight after having to wait in line for an hour to check in because self check in wasn't working. AirAsia has no excuse for being so incompetent.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Lombok. Overall a good experience with the flight departing on time and touching down a few minutes ahead of schedule. As with most AirAsia flights, the cabin crew was cheerful and with a better service mind than many full service carriers. The pre-ordered meal was hot and tasty and served shortly after flight take-off. Cockpit announcements were professional and providing all the necessary information required to feel safe.",0
"Dimapur to Bangalore via Kolkata. I flew with IndiGo and received exemplary service. On my previous flights on IndiGo as well as Dimapur to Kolkata leg of this flight, I had inquired about buying the ""Girl Power"" Lapel Pin for my daughter and was told every time ""not available"". I inquired on this flight as well and the pin wasn't available but seeing the disappointment in my eyes, cabin crew  immediately took off the Girl Power badge off her uniform and gave it to me. This level of service and concern is exemplary and way beyond call of duty - kudos  for her generosity and to IndiGo for nurturing employees like her - way to go!",0
"9:00pm Jetstar Airways flight from Changi to Melbourne, first thing I noticed about the flight was that it was very cramped and the seats uncomfortable. Being on a saver fare, no food was included, but found the prices to be reasonable onboard - but water should be free. Flown Jetstar many times on domestic flights, but will not fly again on international as the comfort and service is not up to par compared to other budget airlines such as Scoot and AirAsia x.",1
"Queenstown to Gold Coast via Cairns. They weighed and charged me $60 for my handbag. This is apparently their thing. Included in your 7kg carry on is your handbag and they enforce it and charged me $60 for 2kg! Way to ruin a holiday. First time Jetstar and never again. The planes was filthy, food and spills on both planes from QT. No screens on international leg & extra crammed seating. May I also suggest having 2 Menus instead of cheapskates using the same one when certain items arent available on domestic flights. Not looking forward to the flight back.",1
"First time flying with Scoot's Boeing 787-800. I was surprised that the seat offers good seat pitch and recline even when compared to existing full service airline seats on the Boeing 787. The the light and cabin crew call buttons are a design flaw that Scoot have yet to rectify. Apart from that, flight arrived 15 minutes earlier and the cabin crew were professional and friendly. No doubt that Scoot offers very competitive airfares on this route and the overall experience was positive for an LCC.",0
Fly drive Mukdahan - KOP - DMK. Poor service at check in. Bag overweight so had to pay extra. No problem. Went to service desk to pay. Lady started to serve my wife and then dealt with someone at the next window already being served and ignored us. Flight cramped compared to Nok Air. Drive was fine and on time from Mukdahan. Plane to DMK a little late.,1
"Our booking from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu was for 17h30, got email that delay until 19.30. Checked in 16.30 and went to departure area. By 19h00 notification of another 1hr delay. 20h45 no official communication but flight staff member informed us that entire flight crew for our flight had been rerouted to another flight. All AirAsia staff disappeared and at 21h00 an announcement over public address system informed us that flight was delayed until 02h40. At customer service cubical in departues there was one AirAsia person with a queue of at least 50 customers waiting to be served. We then went home, no point staying in KK for 30 hrs as our return flight was at 15h00 on Sunday",1
KUL-LOP-KUL in October 2012. My first trip to Lombok Indonesia. Took advantage of the launch fares (RM 88) and can't complain about the price for a 3 hour 1200+ mile flight. LCCT was its usual mess but I have worked out my standard operating procedure so that I got to the departure hall in good time. Lombok international airport was a little better for departure but arrival hall clearance was slow. The flights were on time and uneventful. Typical AirAsia (AK) service.,0
"Worst booking experience I have had. I originally booked a flight leaving Singapore to Bangkok at 17:45, a few weeks later I received a notification saying that the flight schedule will be changed and that my flight will now leave at 22:00. With the new flight times due to security ( according to one the unhelpful phone customer service representative), it will be impossible to make my flight connection onto Rome. I have contacted the airline several times but all they are willing to do is to waive the change fee and put me on a Tigerair flight paying the fare difference which funnily enough is way more expensive that if you were booking a completely new flight. Overall I feel angry, frustrated and robbed. Shame on you Scoot.",1
"Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia's well-known low-cost airline with technically unbeatable fares, which is really like a local bus service. My flight was smooth, check-in for domestic flights is also possible at self check-in kiosks, so it saved a lot of time. Seats were a bit tightly packed and if you didn't order meal or not planning to buy duty-free stuff, there is no contact between you and the crew. Basic flight experience, but highly recommended for anyone, who does not require sumptuous conditions for travel.",0
"Melbourne to Amritsar via Singapore booked for January 2018. Worst airline ever! If there were negative points I could give them, I would. Appalling customer service, incompetent staff on ground and in the cabin. They lost my luggage to being with and ruined the first week of my holiday. Despite booking Scootbiz and having flexibility in my ticket, when I enquired to change my flight to leave early, they quoted me USD 550 to change my ticket. This is after I paid USD 799 for my ticket. When I go to book a fresh ticket with the same extras etc, the new ticket is USD 794. How does this work! How are they even allowed to operate in the Australian market?",1
"Delhi to Kochi. On May 31, I reached the airport at around 6:00 AM and checked in at the emergency counter. I had a friend also traveling with me whose luggage was less than 15 Kg. I asked the indigo staff if my excess luggage can be adjusted with him. Staff  told me to pay the extra amount. I immediately agreed to pay. Hence as per the baggage policy, I paid 400*10Kg -4000Rs. On arriving at Kochi airport after a 40-minute wait, I discovered that one of the luggage was lost and reported to the baggage claim representative. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, she cross-checked with the boarding pass and confirmed me that the bag of 10Kg is missing. I spoke to the indigo staff and have no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage. One of the senior officials of Indigo called me on June 9th and confirmed that the bag weight was 10Kg and a refund of 3500INR will be given. I expressed a complete dissatisfaction as I paid 4000Rs extra for the same bag. The staff promised me that he will check with the finance department and revert back. But I haven't received any call yet. I find it unprofessional how such a large airline like Indigo can lose luggage.  To add insult to injury, I am faced with obtaining compensation for those items that are far less than their worth.",1
"Singapore to Hong Kong. Not bad for a budget airline. Aircraft was new and had legroom significantly more than some budget carriers, and it pushed off on time. Crew looked professional, well trained and were multilingual. I have heard of horror stories but thankfully it didn't happen to me.",0
SIN-DEL The flight was awful. I asked for an exit row seat and got the seat in front of exit row which did not recline. Had to sit upright for 6 hours. Babies hollering and crying everywhere. No food or drink unless you buy - they should at least serve a sandwich on an international flight - what does it cost? 50 cents?,1
"Both flights in and out have issues, still waiting near the gate two hours after planned departure. Unbelievable, what's mind blowing is that they manage every time to stuff it up, highly unrecommended, trust me it is not worth it, pay the extra 20 bucks and be there on time.",1
"I booked a flight for our honeymoon supposedly on last May, but I made a mistake and booked March instead so I paid for a rebooking fee. Since pandemic started last March, we were unable to fly last May. So I was given options, I can get a full refund (they stated the FULL AMOUNT, inclusive of the rebooking fee since they were the one who cancelled the flight, not us) or have it credited to our account wallet. I chose the former. I was advised that I have to wait for 4 billing cycles, when August arrived, no email, no reply nothing. I followed it up then was advised again to wait for another 4months. When nothing is still refunded, I followed up again through fb and sent them emails and I have to wait for 7 billing cycles. When I got mad and sent them emails, screenshots of their replies, 2-3days after I think they emailed me saying that I get to be refunded minus the rebooking fee.",1
"Singapore to Hong Kong. The flight experience wowed me. This was only the second week that Scoot was taking over this route (previously,it was operated by Tiger Air A320), and I was highly anticipating my journey, especially given the aircraft, a Boeing 787. This inflight experience was on par of that of full-service carriers (with the obvious expection of IFE, food that is included in the ticket price and the like), I found the seats to be really comfortable and the window shade was innovative, what with the feature to dim the windows to suit your comfort level. I ordered an item from the duty-free catalogue before take off and I received it quickly. Although being a budget carrier means that it has no free food or drinks, the service level was not compromised-on par with its parent airline, Singapore Airlines. If you are expecting the seat pitch to be on a level with other budget airlines, then get ready for a surprise-the seat pitch was as good as some full-service carriers! Although I would recommend anyone taking Scoot (as with any budget airline) to bring your own entertainment on board- but overall, the flight experience was on par with that of other carriers and they landed in Hong Kong 15 minutes ahead of scheduled! Was an amazing flight, given the low fares and the good service, I would definitely take this airline again. However, one complaint that I do have is with the armrests - the attendant call button and the overhead lights button were on the armrests, so you could accidentally press them really easily and I had to take extra care to not push them.",0
"Delhi to Hyderabad with IndiGo. My flight was cancelled and I was moved to another flight. Apart from this, everything was good apart from the cost of the meals. I didn't find the coffee and noodles too special and weren't great. New flight was on time and comfortable. Not much to talk about but was good as far as the budget airline tag goes.",0
"Melbourne - Chiang Mai return. Plane was a little late leaving Chiang Mai and due to ""congestion"" our plane landed at the international airport - presumably not carrying enough fuel to wait for a landing slot. Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food. Minimal breakfast in hotel but no lunch offered even though our substitute flight was 1.45pm. Low budget should not mean such rubbish service when the airline is at fault.",1
"Jetstar is absolutely terrible. Cancelled flight 3 hours before. We have already arrived at the airport to be told our flight was cancelled till the next day! Have to organise a hotel ourselves as there is no Jetstar staff available apparently and have to wake up at 3am only just getting to our hotel at 9pm. Flew with Jetstar on way to Phuket, also was postponed a day with an added stop! No food or drinks included and a lot of extra payments have to be made for baggage etc.. Shocking entertainment package included with bad movies which you also have to pay for. Would not recommend.",1
"Mumbai to Patna via Lucknow with IndiGo. Excellent experience thru-out from check-in to de-boarding. Check-in at Mumbai was courteous, fast and efficient, and the best part was no nickling-diming for 2-3 kg extra weight. In-flight crew was even better with all the ladies acting pleasant and welcoming. It's the crew that makes the airline, truly.",0
Terrible airline. No flexibility and really poor customer service. Flight was delayed 2 hours due to operational circumstances. Missed our check in at our hotel which I made them aware of and didnt bother putting us in a hotel.,1
MNL-HK on a 5.30 am flight. Check-in is a breeze since we opt for web-check-in (10 min for baggage drop and immigration) Cebu Pacific uses NAIA Terminal 3 so no complains there. Immigration personnel are all young (no more grumpy old immigration staff). Boarding is on time flight crew are very warm and friendly. Landed 10 min ahead of schedule. Will fly them again for International trips especially in the morning schedule but totally opposite with domestic flights. Seats are comfortable if you're lucky enough to ride their new A320.,0
"I flew from Darwin to Brisbane and Brisbane to Darwin. I am 6' 4"" and just can not fit in the seats. Very uncomfortable and painful for 4 hours. Never again.",1
"Scoot changed my flight date to 3 days earlier for operation reason, and said I can either take this new flight or get a refund. I couldn't change my plans at such short notice, so I requested a refund in mid-June 2022. It's now been over 2 months (nearly 3 months) and I'm still waiting for my refund. I've called them every few weeks, and each time, they tell me that my refund is at the last stage of the process, pending final manager approval. They tell me it'll be 15 days, but they tell me this each time they miss this deadline. They won't let me talk to a manager, and they won't let me contact the refunds team directly.  Scoot has missed its own refund deadline of 30 business days by a huge margin. Upon my latest call, they said they'll refund me within 3-4 weeks - despite having already failed to pay for nearly 3 months.",1
Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur then Kuala Lumpur to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh) then back from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur and home again to Melbourne. I have flown Air Asia X and standard Air Asia many times now and am always more than happy with their service. Not only were all flights on time (I have never had a delayed Air Asia flight) however all flights also arrived at their destinations early! Food and Beverages onboard are fantastic (We pre-booked meals which aren't expensive) and all onboard staff were friendly and more than helpful. I could not speak more highly of Air Asia and for a budget airline. Highly recommend for the budget costs great service on-time performance and onboard comfort.,0
"Worst airline. Flight was canceled. No answer to my mail, WA or live chat after 20h. So far no new flight scheduled!!! What is wrong with lion air? No customer service number available to call. Unbelievable.",1
Melbourne - Phuket 3 February. I was quite impressed by the flight. The staff were friendly and helpful and the 787 was very comfortable. The food was quite good although the portions were quite small. I also wish the IFE had more choices.,0
JQ25/JQ26 Cairns to Tokyo and back on a Boeing 787-800 first row - business class which in terms of the seat and service is equivalent to international premium class or Qantas domestic business class. Very good service. Good food and drinks as much as you want. First time on a 787 decided to treat myself. IFE with limited selection. Good earphones. Comfortable seat although it is a recliner one and not lie flat. Plenty of legroom in row 1. Just to bypass the largest queue I ever saw at Narita airport and go straight to the check in counter worth the upgrade. Only thing missing is priority bag service to receive it first upon arrival.,0
Clark-KUL economy. Flight according to schedule. On time. No fuss. Good leg room. Hard working kind and pleasant staff. Will fly with AA again - much better than other budget airlines I have flown with and great value for money.,0
Flew from Sydney to Penang via KL then Penang to KL KL to Miri Miri to Kuching Kuching to KL and then on to Singapore. Both ground and air crews were excellent extremely helpful and kind with our elderly parents with mobility issues. Check in at all airports was quick and efficient. Arrival at KL LCCT was a shock did not expect to have to walk the long distance from the tarmac to the terminal building in the hot blazing sun. Most airports would have a bus to transport the passengers to the terminal building. Not a good first impression of KL. Will certainly fly AirAsia again.,0
"I am on a trip with family of 4 on a leisure trip. We bought a ticket on 6pm flying from Tawau to Kuala Lumpur. But was informed about the flight change to 8:40pm after few days prior to departing. To make matter worse, the flight further delay to 9:25pm after we checked in on departure date. Bad experience of this airline, avoid at all costs if you can.",1
"We had great experience with Cebu Pacific. They have great customer service. We arrived at 7am for our 12:55pm flight from Cebu to Manila because we came from Badian, Cebu and wanted to make sure we missed traffic. The assistant at the desk offered to get my family of 5 on the 8:30am flight instead of waiting for 6 hours at the airport. We were so grateful to get to our final destination sooner. They gave water and snacks when boarding for efficiency since it was only a 1 hour flight. We will definitely be flying them again. Thank you Cebu Pacific!",0
"Flight out of Sydney and I was unable to board the plane. My family went ahead but I was left at Sydney. On checkin we had a good chat to David Scanlon, who was shocked when I later returned and was unable to board. David tried to change my booking but was unable to do so and advised I call the airline to amend my booking. On my way home David called me and told me he sent a page out to get my phone number. He told me he was able to change my booking free of charge , under the stressful situation I was in, having to leave my children. The way David went above and beyond was exceptional. This is our first time flying with Scoot, and thanks to David we will be returning. I will also be referring Scoot to all of my friends and family. Thank you David. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. You are an example of what outstanding customer service is .",0
"Air Asia cancelled my flight (this seems to be more and more common with them), but did not refund the money to my credit card account. They have stopped providing any general call center services - there are no phone numbers. Instead, there is only a bot controlled chat function (online or app) that limits your ability to request anything except what they want you to request. No access to a real person. After a couple of glitches involving the bot, it finally found my records and transferred the refund to my member ""credit account."" Supposedly, within a limited amount of time, the credit can be used to buy another ticket from Air Asia. But there seems to be strings attached. I'll never use Air Asia again unless there is no other option.",1
"Singapore to Bali with Scoot. It was a horrible and uneventful flight. Flight was delayed for nearly three hours and all Scoot compensated us with was a packet of snacks and a bottle of water. Onboard the flight, the crew were generally okay. Seat was uncomfortable and very narrow. Legroom was also quite tight. Overall a bad flight with Scoot.",1
"Journey from Kochi to Dubai, seats were pretty cramped, we asked for an aisle seat and the adjacent seat to that (middle seat in this case as it was 3x3) but they gave us both an aisle seat, that was still ok, the passage area was not wide enough as you have to adjust yourself when an air hostess passes through. The seat was well cramped the storage area was good, its a budget airlines with the cost of ticket of a normal airlines, only benefit was that we have 30 kgs each. The storage area on above the seats was pretty wide. Staff and service was pretty average - average experience.",1
"This company has the worst customer service. I purchased a ticket for my fiance and put the wrong birthday by accident. I tried to change the birthday info online but it was greyed out so I couldn't fix it, even though Cebu Pacific posted their policy which allows changes to the birthday up to 2 hours before flight. I tried to look for a customer service number and called several of them but all of them throughout the world are automated answering services. So I had no choice but to purchase a second ticket. My fiance explained the situation to the ticket agent at the airport and the agent said no problem you can just go to the customer service office and get it fixed. The only problem, the customer service office was closed! And when I disputed the charge with my credit card company, Cebu Pacific managed to twist this whole thing around and state I have no rights to a refund due to their ""No Cancellation Policy"" We will never fly this airline again! Such a simple issue uncovered layer upon layer of the ""screw the customer"" scam that Cebu Air has carefully crafted to ensure that you get screwed and have zero consumer rights!",1
"First, we order a ticket that doesnt go through, the site tells us that there was an error. Suddenly we receive an email saying it anyways went through. However, the ticket suddenly had the wrong date, which we only realized when standing in the airport. We knew that we had not put the wrong date, because we both checked through everything before submitting the order, and it was further proven later when air Asia again sent a wrong date after having spoken with them on the phone. When standing in the airport in need of another ticket, AirAsia did not help us get the date adjusted unless we paid a huge amount of money. We had to pay still to pay to change our tickets, even though it was never our mistake. Afterwards, we had to call the customer service 5 times, because every time they sent an adjusted offer there was a mistake. Once the wrong flight, another time the wrong time, and then again the wrong date. Only in the end we got it right after having called 5 times. When we then fly from Krabi to Kuala Lumpur where we have to transfer, we have to pick up our luggage and check in again. We were waiting for our luggage for 30 minutes before it arrived. We then ran to the check in counter arriving 10 minutes after the gate closed and the employee did not help us. He said it was too late and we need to buy new tickets. He said that we should know the airline policy of closing the check in counter when there is 1 hour until the flight leaves and that we should have booked flights with longer time apart. I am furious and I am never flying with AirAsia again.",1
"Flew Melbourne to Sydney with Jetstar Airways. Worst experience ever! They are definetely not a flexible airline, got charged $25 for an extra kilo. Also got told by the crew that the plane was 40 min delayed. Later on they announced that they over sold the tickets (on purpose) to that trip and its first time in a while everyone turned up so they were trying to offer a voucher to 2 people willing to travel later in the day. Rip-off. This company is not a lot cheaper than others that will offer way better conditions to flight. Not worth the stress!",1
Plane on an average condition but when you are 2 hours delayed everything looks bleak. Flight was 100% full. After take-off the in-flight service started where you could buy from a menu. Nothing complimentary was offered. For 1 hour and 56 minutes either sleep or read nothing to do. IFE they offer on B787 through app and your own headphones. This period from the 11 B787 that they operate 6 were out of service due to spare unavailability.,1
Prices are going up and reliability is going down. All International flights departing MNL last Saturday evening were late. No weather problems just late arrivals of aircraft. BKK was nearly 2.5 hrs late no flight information screens working in T3 and passengers were shuttled around like cattle between gates. I'd really like to know who gets these so called cheap GO Fares because it doesn't matter how far ahead you book nothing is available on the routes I fly. I'll continue to use Cebu because they offer good value for money no frills service but they need to work on reliability which has up to now been very good. If they went head-to- head with Air Asia they'd lose.,0
"Cebu to Manila. Original aircraft A319 reserved seat 11b. Exit row Before flight Cebu Pacific changed aircraft to A320. Which put me standard seating section, middle seat A319 has no 11A seat so I'm next to exit door. Cebu Pacific refuse to refund my money even though they acknowledge aircraft change and I was charged exit row seat but ended up in standard seating. Don't book seat 11B you will be screwed.",1
"Honolulu to Osaka for a base fare of 80 USD, so I shouldnt complain. There are some things to consider if you fly with Scoot. Its ultra low cost in all aspects. Long lines for check-in which took about an hour. My bag was 20,8 kg and my hand luggage 5 kg. I had to shift some luggage to my hand luggage to prevent paying for overweight. In the end it doesnt matter because the same weight is going onboard. No wonder it took ages at check-in if they do this for everyone. I paid extra for the quiet child free cabin in front of the aircraft. Rows 4 to 8 are supposed to be quiet but it doesnt add any value because theres no bulkhead and with kids seated in rows 9 and 10 I wouldnt call it a quiet cabin. They strictly enforce the no own food and drinks policy onboard. Like a strict teacher a member of the cabin crew passed by every few minutes to tell passengers they were not allowed to eat food not purchased onboard. This was forbidden according to Singapore law. Just a lame excuse because there is no such law and its just a company policy to generate more revenue. Dont order meals online because you pay 15 US Dollar, while onboard it will cost you only 15 Singapore Dollar. I ordered a hot meal and a soft drink onboard. According to their menu it costs 18 SD, because you get 1 SD discount when you order a meal and a drink in once. I was charged 19 SD. I told them it should be 18 SD but they insisted it was 15 for the meal and 4 for the drink. Pointed them to their own menu and then I got the excuse that I should have ordered the combo deal instead of the meal and the drink. They simply do not think logically because its exactly the same. In the end I paid 18. Theres no IFE onboard, not even a screen with the flight time, arrival time, etc. The only entertainment is looking out of the window, which they also ruin because immediately after takeoff the windows are blinded until shortly before landing. Maybe this kind of airline works in Asia, but in Europe or the USA they wouldnt get a feet on the ground.",1
Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. Very nice journey nice crew and leather seats in airplane. Very easy to book. If you book place near window (right side) you will see nice view to Thai islands for example Ko Samui.,0
"Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. When I booked this low-cost airline flight online I saw no indication that the ticket did not include checked bags.  I ended up paying $400 additional for checked baggage. Onboard the flight there is no free meal, no free water, no in-flight entertainment screen, renting a blanket is 10MYR.",1
The service is terrible and pathetic. I was supposed to receive $400 voucher 2 months ago but havent received it yet. I called them more than 7 times and they kept saying that they have escalated my case and forwarded the case to the finance team to process the voucher. All of the staff promised me that I will be receiving voucher in next 24hrs after the phone call. But its been 2 months I have not received the voucher. Its so frustrating to keep waiting on the calls every time.,1
JOG to Lombok via SUB and DPS. Flights operated by Wings air new ATR planes good staff no food for sale as flights just over 1 hour. All flights on time. Very clean planes.,0
"I used to love flying Indigo for domestic flights in India but this long haul codeshare flight with TK was really disappointing. It is a too big difference with Turkish Airlines. Only a one time service on a flight duration of 7,5 hours on the leg Delhi-Istanbul, which is already extremely long. The second drink was only served to half of the people and then the crew disappeared. I was only able to get a coffee by a crew call. The third round was chargeable. What a poor service. Crew very nervous and chaotic. Very very Indian English, hardly understandable. Tiny seats, not even space for arms and shoulders. No Inflight Entertainment. No, Indigo, never again on a longhaul flight. There are better options.",1
"I was flying back from Singapore to Jakarta and it was not my first time flying with lion air. Ground crew at Changi was pleasant but wasn't really smiling that much. Check in was easy and everything was going well. When I got to my seat, the seat pocket infront of me was a bit ripped off but I didnt really care about it. Cabin crew was friendly and nice. There wasn't any inflight entertainment other than some magazines and there wasn't any food menu either. However, they did sell a few main courses, snacks, and drinks. The food was okay. Leg room was spacious compared to competitors. At the end, it was quite a pleasant flight with Lion Air",0
"Outbound 12 Feb JQ029. Home 19 Feb JQ030. Great Crew and excellent service. Good food and drink selection and they were quite generous with it! However the worst business class seat ever. In my humble opinion the executive who chose this should be strapped to one for 24 hours I think he or she may need hospitalisation afterwards! To be honest I can not believe that Boeing allowed Jetstar to do this to a Dreamliner. I was nearly crippled when I got off and I am only 5'10"".",1
Jakarta to Singapore. This is the most horrible experience ive encountered. They didnt have any sort of organisation or communication skills towards their customers. I was waiting in line at the checkin counter almost for 30 minutes and i have been asking which checkin counter is for my flight and it turns out that it was different. When i got there turns out I missed my flight because nobody was there to help or answer my question. Never use this airline ever again,1
AVV-SYD-AVV. Great trip. The plane was new seats clean and flight left on time. Food options were good. Crew were very professional. Quick to board check-in and deplane. Overall great trip and I will fly Jetstar again. Fares were only $35.,0
Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City. What a joke. My friend and I bought ticket together under 1 transaction. Airline let us sit separately when checked in. Reason: all seats are full. We bought ticket 4 months in advance. When they heard that they asked us to request the in-flight attendant. Of couse that didn't work and we ended up sitting separately. Bottom line: don't buy this airline if you travel in group.,1
I booked a window seat going to Brisbane and an aisle seat to return to Sydney with Jetstar Airways. Strangely enough it was the same aircraft - VH VQA. Have to say window seat wins hands down for space and comfort. Cabin could have been cleaner as I found crumbs on my seat and the air seemed a bit stale. Magazines were well worn despite only being midway through the month and a previous passenger had left their boarding pass in the seat pocket from a few months ago. Check in queue was quite long but it moved along ok. However at Brisbane it was inconvenient that they did the handcarry size and weight check after check-in which meant queuing up 4 times before actually boarding and made worse with the lack of seats immediately at the gate because they put the flight next to several other minor routes instead of some priority spacing unlike other carriers had set up. Booking the flight through the Jetstar website was good. The interface was easy enough and the early check-in feature and early seat selection are big drawcards for me. I think its a great idea for the cabin crew to direct passengers to their seat because one of them omitted this on my flight down to Brisbane and it meant someone took my seat by mistake until I pointed this out to the cabin crew. The cabin crew were more diligent for the return flight for Sydney and they directed every one to the right seat.,0
"Sydney to Berlin via Singapore. They denied me to fly and would not make any concession to rebook me, losing me not only their cheap flight but all the connecting travel. I have traveled twice to Europe in the last 16 months using my passport that was water damaged on a hike in New Zealand two years ago. No immigration offices in New Zealand Germany England Italy Sweden And Australia have flagged it and the officious duty manager would not let us check it with the anyone in immigration. I understand the airline can get in trouble if they let a damaged passport get through. But on return to Canberra where I thought I would have to apply for a passport from scratch because it was so damaged, it was fine for just a renewal. We were not the only people having problems we watched a family brought to tears by one of the other booking agents. No food, no water, no service, no power,no Tv, no blankets,no pillow, no baggage, no care. No flight for me.",1
"Positives - flights were on time and cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Actual seats - standard leg room for any long distance flights (so not bad). Negative - no in-flight entertainment (no TV screens). So download films onto your mobile device and watch during flight. But you have to pay for power (6.00 each way). Negative - stodgy, microwave food that you have to pay for. Top tip - eat in the departure lounge and take drinks and sandwiches with you for the flight. Negative - have to pay for all drinks, and they only take credit cards (no cash and no debit cards). Negative - no pillows or blankets, so take your own. In the end, you can pay about 80 more for these extras, that you wouldn't pay on a full service airline. Once you get your head around the fact that this is a long distance ""Ryanair"", and you come prepared for the above, it's actually a reasonable, direct London-Bangkok flight.",0
"Perth to Gold Coast. The tray table was clean, as well as the seat, windows and lavatory. Although, there was food and gum stuck to the floor. Before the flight, I had to wait in a giant queue to get my baggage weighed, even though I wasn't purchasing extra baggage. There were machines that were supposed to weigh the bags but they were not working. Both pilots managed to do nice smooth landings. For the price, it was a great experience and I'll definitely fly Jetstar again.",0
"Zamboanga to Cebu with Cebu Pacific. This airline is always delayed. It is delayed so often that they should just change all of the flight times to account for the delays. Additionally, their website is setup so that there are several extra charges added if you are not paying attention (food, insurance, donations). I would not recommend this airline unless you have all day to take a one hour flight.",1
"DMK-PHN-DMK via FD 606 and 607 respectively. Flight was on time with a couple minutes late. Both flight was close to full as it was holiday week in Cambodia. Once again nothing much to complain or pride. Except I noticed the quality of ground crew and flight attendant going downward. Unfriendly and very unapproachable. I know this is a low-fare airline however given the price paid for at least a smile or ""welcome aboard"" is shown to the customers.",0
"A terrible experience with Jetstar. My Flight was cancelled 2 hours prior to departure with the email I received stating that they would cover upto $200 in accommodation and $30 In meals. I was moved to a Qantas flight leaving an hour earlier. I did not make the request to move my flight. I informed them I would not make the earlier flight as I was currently driving to the airport. The Jetstar rep stated I would now have to speak to qantas as I was now on a qantas flight. I called Qantas who changed me to a flight early the next morning. I was required to stay in Sydney and as per the email I received from Jetstar stating my expenses would be covered. The next morning I made the request with Jetstar regarding my expenses. Jetstar stated that as I didnt make the earlier flight they had changed me onto they would not be covering my expenses. I will never be travelling with Jetstar in the future, this has been a terrible experience. I do not understand how Jetstar have stated that they will cover expenses and are now stating they will not be covered. I do not believe this complies with consumer law.",1
Chennai via Kuwait. This is my first fly on indigo. Because of the crew. They give a five star service and the flight is on time takeoff and landing. I really appreciate to those staff. I hope to fly again in indigo.,0
"Was due to fly Jetstar business class from Melbourne to Denpasar. Received text overnight indicating flight was cancelled. Live chat gave me 2 options: a flight via Singapore with Qantas later that day or wait another 1.5 days for a Qantas direct flight. I chose the first option and was assured that as I had booked JQ business class, I would be transferred to Qantas business class. Of course when I arrived at the airport I discovered I was in QF economy. I again contacted Jetstar live chat, who confirmed I should be in business class but could do no more to help me. A walk to the international Jetstar counter showed it to be closed. My 5.5hr direct flight became a 13hr epic. I am facing the same situation now in trying to get home. Customer service is non-existent - they use bots for direct messaging and facebook comments from the Filipino staff repeat the same information over and over. Not possible to get through to call centre either. Never again.",1
I have flown with AA numerous times over the past 5 years both internationally and domestically and as with every thing 'always read the fine print' and you will have no problems (you have to check the box to verify that when you purchase your ticket). You get what you pays for and Air Asia overall do precisely that with a minimum of fuss and bother.,0
Horrible experience. There were huge crowds at the check in counters. We were standing for 35 minutes. Finally when we reached the counter there was some system issues which the counter staff was struggling to resolve. It took more than 10 minutes. Finally system was set right but told your check in time has gone and could not accept the bags. We had to reschedule the flights by paying 10k extra and we reached destination 7 hours late,1
"As a foreign American passenger, it doesn't get any worst flying with Cebu Pacific and in my honest opinion is probably the worst airline experience I have ever had in my 54 years of life. There were numerous delays, unclear update status, and ""EXTREMELY"" poor cabin climate control. I was literally sweating in my seat whiles waiting for the pilot to perform his pre-flight checks and waiting an unusually long time for the pilot to taxi onto the runway. There were no snacks unless it was paid for and from what I remember, even when flying with Philippines Airline it was provided to passengers free of charge even during my previous short flight. If things don't change with Cebu Pacific, they will follow the path of other bankrupt airlines.",1
PEN-SIN. Check-in was quick as I did not have luggage and boarding was on time. Departed 10 minutes earlier and arrived 15 minutes before schedule. Flight was good and flight attendants were polite but seemed tired as this was the last flight of the day. The only thing I find annoying is that you cannot change your ticket if your flight leaves within 48 hours. Otherwise Air Asia provide a good service which is better than some other airlines.,0
"We have just travelled to Hawaii on Jetstar and it was a nightmare from the start. At Melbourne airport we waited almost 2 hours at the check-in desk even though we had done ""so called online check in"". When I told the girl at the desk she told me I was lucky - some people wait 3 hours. Then we waited almost 2 hours on board to get anything to eat or drink because we had not paid the outrageous fee for meals! Since being in Hawaii I have spoken to several of my compatriots who swear they will never travel Jetstar again. Personally I am dreading the return trip to Melbourne on Friday morning. So much for Qantas Frequent Flyer card which I have had for 20 years. A very dissatisfied customer.",1
"Unfortunately another Jetstar disaster. Often our major complaint is the the poor customer service, the lack of service and the grossly rude staff. This trip however was Jetstar's worst example of service to date. With my elderly mother in-law traveling with us we requested assistance as she suffers from MS. In Melbourne we were convinced to use a buggy instead of a wheelchair. As many of you know there is a lengthy corridor to the gates so assistance was required, she cannot walk more than a couple of hundred metres without stopping for an extended period. By the time we reached the service area after security there was a sign stating they were closed. No buggy, no wheelchair and an elderly passenger pushing herself to the gate down that long corridor. Once in Tasmania, her legs and knees swelled so badly we could not walk anywhere at all. Our days were spent sightseeing from a car, evenings at home, no outings, no dinner and no shopping because what little energy and strength she had was used to walk to and from the house and car. We cancelled dinner reservations, wine tasting and MONA. As a family we know how to manage her condition, all of this inflammation in her legs was a direct result of her Friday walk and when we tried to explain this Jetstar staff were dismissive and naturally did not want to accept responsibility. On our return we were overweight with our carry-on only baggage. We are only to assume we were overweight on our way to Tasmania given that at absolutely no point did anyone check our bags in Melbourne or weigh them so we assumed we were fine. Owning this mistake we unhappily paid the exorbitant $60 fee to check an 11-12kg bag. At this time we discussed that nobody checked our bags at check in at the counter, nobody asked if Anjutta required assistance, nobody did their job yet again but had the nerve to cripple us on check in at the gate. We have no problem folllowing rules, process and guidelines as this is very familiar territory for us however all we ask for Jetstar is that you ensure your business upholds the quality, consistency and values it preaches. It is simply another example of your poor service and more importantly your lack of consistency from airport to airport. This is a training issue and an onboarding issue, you cannot run a successful business unless your employees are being taught and upheld to the highest standards. You have failed repeatedly in our eyes. We have flown with you several times and we will have to revisit our trust in you.",1
AirAsia failed to get me CGK-JKT on Christmas Eve. All they offered was flight to Sydney and Melbourne - and make your own way there. Couldn't offer me a direct flight for 48 hours from KUL although MAS had spare seats.,1
"Manila to Bangkok. I'm critical of Cebu Pacific many times, yet today it was a perfect flight. On time, in a wide body aircraft with good lighting and the feel of space. Even the food carts were well stocked. The cabin crew kept their announcements and other botherings to a minimum, the entire flight from boarding to deplaning was smooth and calm and fluent. A perfect flight. I never thought that Cebu Pacific would ever warrant a 10/10 from me.",0
"Kolkata to Hyderabad. Best Indian airline, but no in flight entertainment. A value for money airline with nice service - keep it up IndiGo. Nice food and no delay on the flight.",0
"We had our Jetstar flights cancel 2.5hrs prior to dep. Citing ""bad weather"" (raining) they only provided alternative options for the following day. We were forced to purchase Virgin tickets because their planes can miraculously fly in the rain. After demanding such, Jetstar first told us we would receive a full refund on the card purchased from, only to receive a notice 2 weeks later saying a ""credit"" had been processed. Contacting them again, THEY ARE NOW REFUSING to provide a refund (despite promising one) saying it's not their company policy. Due to Jetstar citing ""bad weather"" this apparently permits them to refuse refunding customers money even though it was rubbish to begin with.",1
Darwin-Melbourne. Turned up for a 7.30 am flight found out it had been cancelled - not notified then told the wrong time for flight. Turned up to discover real time was the next day and then landed an hour late no one would tell me what was going on - lost a day of my holiday.,1
"Singapore - Jakarta in early October on Lion Air. First impressions count, and Lion Air didn't deliver on most counts. What's the point of sending an email asking passengers to web check-in when the facility doesn't work? At the airport the handling agents weren't very friendly but I give them credit for ensuring a speedy boarding of the flight. On board is where the fun begins. Cabin crew were busy talking amongst themselves instead of greeting passengers. Apparently they don't seem to be interested in keeping the plane clean, as I found some wrappers lying on my assigned seat. Then the cherry to top the cake: ""this is flight XXX to Jakarta, could passengers please check their boarding passes to ensure if they are on the right flight."" First time I've heard that in my life. I suppose that is probably due to personnel mistakes made at Indonesian airports, which really makes me seriously wonder how this airline operates. On the plus side, the ticket was the cheapest among all the low-cost airlines, and my flight departed on time and arrived early in Jakarta. But that was about it. I can't say the seats were very comfortable, nor the inflight beverage bar service fantastic (they don't even have menus in the seat pockets). If I had to fly them I'd do so if I have no choice. Otherwise I'd feel much more at ease if I can fly an airline that has better service and proper safety standards.",1
"Worst airline ever!  We had a flight at 6:10am (Apr 15th) but were able to change it at 5:00am around 11:00pm (Apr 14th) the night before. We left our hotel on time, tried to check in through the kiosk and it wasnt accepting our itinerary # so we tried to check in through the counter and staff said we were too late! Like what?! How does that make any sense?! Even though the airport is small and security/check in takes like 5 minutes - with the gates right there, apparently we were too late. Why give us the option to change our flight time on YOUR website and then not able to accommodate to us? We were told that we had no other option but to rebook another flight which cost 19,000 pesos in cash because they said they didnt accept card. We didnt have that much cash on us but luckily our friends who were with us lend us some.  I had asked if they were able to reimburse if not all, some of that money back, considering we paid lots & lots of $$$ and all they said was no, sorry.",1
"Auckland to Christchurch. Check in, boarding and bag-wait took way too long - so inefficient. Really should have enforced more on baggage policies as people brought too many bags. Pre-flight conditions weren't even checked: my seatmate had tray table down while the plane took off.The stewardess didn't even care. Take off & landing were really smooth.  A320 was really old, and interior cabin smell gave people headache. Tray tables weren't cleaned properly. Toilet was clean though.",0
Chiang Mai to Surathani. The customer assistants are mostly rude to me. They try to charge you extra cost and need to demonstrate by your documentation that you booked the extra baggage etc. Prices are good if you get the deal but if you need extra services cit an get more expensive than a regular airways company (not lowcost).,1
"As a 6 ft 3, fairly well built bloke, I regularly struggle with long haul comfort - though this doesn't really stop me from travelling on every opportunity. Scoot were competitively priced on our routes from Hong Kong to Perth and then Perth back to Singapore, so I thought I'd give them a go given their association with Singapore Airlines which bred confidence. I was genuinely amazed how much room I found myself with, seat width I didn't find an issue. On one leg we asked whether it were possible to sit at one of the pairs of seats at the rear of the plane. I highly recommend these. There was plenty of space to the side of the window seat to place books etc. I found the staff pleasant and flights were punctual. I can't comment on the food as I didn't try it but the on-board Wi-Fi was very impressive. Reasonably priced (about 8 for 3 hours if I remember correctly) which kept me entertained. Only negative was the placement of the lighting/attendant buttons on the armrests. Proper design issue there I think. The lack of entertainment was expected so I can't complain but it's probably the only factor that differentiates it negatively from a full service carrier. Overall it was probably the best set of flights I've taken in Economy and put the British Airways 787 offering on the KUL-LHR leg to absolute shame - despite being a budget carrier!",0
SYD-KUL-SYD. A day flight so no reclined seats from the passenger in front. The space between seats was surprisingly decent. Food is average. The airport LCCT - what a sham. Cabin crew were ok. Cost me AUD$660 return. Fully recommended keeping an open mind about the size of the seats and the organisation of the poor airport facilities.,0
"I haven't travelled Jetstar previously and doubt I will again. The ground staff, crew and aircraft itself are good but that's where the positives end. The food is simply inedible - atrocious. To have the gall to charge what they do for it is beyond an insult. Had something akin to a quiche but basically stodge, couldn't even eat it even though I was hungry. Seating is a joke. How anyone is supposed to actually sleep in these seats and not wake up with muscle strain or similar is beyond me. It seems to be an airline whose management wants to abuse its customers or milk them at every opportunity. Sad really.",1
The Jetstar terminal is definitely the least enjoyable and supplied. Onboard I picked a front row seat hoping to enjoy the extra quietness that is supposed to come with the privilege of a front row seat however this never happened because despite having brought my own headphones and entertainment all I could hear was the lead cabin crew persons personal chatter even through what was already quite loud jet whine. This was a morning flight and I think it was the second of the day but the whole cabin seemed to smell of the toilet. My seat pocket although stocked was torn on one side. Made me wonder how much attention the cabin crew pays to presentation probably not much.,1
"For a low cost carrier, its good. Departed on time from Surabaya and landing a bit late in Bandung. The lavatory is a bit awful, the floor a bit dirty, and the sink with no water, and smell. The cabin crew was great, but sometimes they make us confused because so many offers and questions. But I would fly it again if they improve their quality of service.",0
Hong Kong to Male via Kuala Lumpur. Horrible experience with AirAsia.  We suffered a delay of 2 hours so we lost the conexion flight and after long time and queues we were re-scheduled 24 hours later. We were provided a horrible hotel voucher and received very poor attention.,1
Sydney to Melbourne. A good reminder not to fly Jetstar. I was just over the baggage weight allowance and got hit with a fine. Excessive fine for *just* being over the limit. Money grab and poor service.,1
"I just flew with Cebu Pacific who provided an absolutely amazing service, plane was delayed for 2 hours and provided a pot noodle, chocolate biscuits and bottled water. The staff were incredibly friendly and apologetic. these things happen, and the service was great",0
"Melbourne to Phuket via Singapore with Scoot. Worst experience in 22 years of traveling worldwide. Absolutely a budget airline. You get nothing but a seat to sit in. Plane didnt leave on time for departure. 3 and a half hour delay on the return flight, which left us hanging around Changi airport for 6 hours.",0
"Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. I had a 3 hour-ish flight with this one. The check-in was not really fast even though it's self-service and there are many security checks. The boarding time was delayed for roughly 20 minutes. The food I had on the flight (teriyaki chicken rice and curry puff) was just average. The crew is quite young, they did okay service. Seats can recline,  Legroom is terrible. The best thing you can do on this one is having a sleep. Don't choose this airline if you can afford any other options.",1
I was surprised to find that on a flight from Perth to Brisbane there was no food provided. We then had to wait in an enormous queue for more than an hour so no time to get breakfast at the airport.,1
"Flight was cancelled and retimed multiple times to exceedingly inconvenient timing. It is never okay to retime flights to another time because if it was, then I would have bought the ticket at that time and not the one that I choose. Airasia has no customer service whatsoever. A useless robot is not customer service. Airasia also practices Excessively draconian rules on baggage weight as if an extra 1kg of carry on baggage. Charges customers exorbitantly for baggage, food or any service under the guise of low cost.",1
We flew PEN-DMK by FD402. The flight departed and arrived on time. Boarding in Penang smooth and efficient as was the arrival in Bangkok. The cabins are fresh and clean. Crew is efficient and accommodating. So when the fares are reasonable I see no reason not to give AirAsia top marks. It helps that DMK although it looks a bit outdated is more efficient than BKK by far. On a sidenote the question on inflight entertainment is not relevant on a 2 hours flight but the inflight magazine is good so high score here.,0
"Jetstar Airways from Denpasar to Sydney. Web check in worked perfectly. Baggage drop was quite efficient. The aircraft was spacious and clean and bright, and economy class was comfortable with enough leg room. The flight departed Denpasar on time and arrived in Sydney a little earlier than scheduled. Flight attendants were friendly, food was tasty and plentiful but it would be nice to be served breakfast at 6am instead of dinner at 1am. IFE was available with limited free content. A very pleasant experience.",0
"I had an outstanding experience with this airline flying three routes from BLR to HYD, then HYD to LKO and then LKO to BOM. All three flights left right on time and arrived early to their destination. Check in was easy at airport and used their app for boarding passes and check in. On board the crews were polite and worked swiftly to serve passengers. I am unsure why all of the negative reviews, this airlines is leagues above any US carrier.",0
Flew from Caticlan to Manila. The airline overbooked seats and asking us to give up one seat and move onto the next flight. Which is unacceptably crazy! Have to take a bus to get to the planes departure and 3 busses were full elderly and kids have to stand! Upon boarding one of our seats were taken coz apparently the people in the airport booked two people in same seat number. Totally absurd!,1
"I bought a flight from Zipair in July. I will flight 24 of August from Singapore to japan, and take my new flight from Japan to Brazil in 28 of August. In 22 of August I went to a clinic in Singapore and I and my grandchild did the PCR test. In 23 of August in the evening I received a e-mail from Zipair saying that my flight was cancelled. One day before the flight departure. And the next flight available will be only 28 of August (same day that my flight from Emirates will leave Japan). So I had to buy a new ticket that cost four time more from another company and I had to do a new PCR express test that cost me 280SGD per person. Total 560SGD + 2.300SGD for a new ticket. When I asked for refund the first assistant told me that the Zipair will refund the PCR test too. But when I asked for a refund, the company refunded only the ticket value. Be prepared for any inconvenience as it is not a reliable company.",1
Sydney-Honolulu-Sydney in Business class! We selected Jetstar as Hawaiian and Qantas both use 767's versus the A330 Jetstar operates. No airline offers full flat bed seats so it made sense. Maybe Jetstar changed from Star class to business as they were not able to make us feel like stars. The all leather seats give you no support no pillows are provided all you get is a DIY blow up neck ring. The crew was running through the cabin with the attempt to avoid any eye contact with passengers. Coming back we had a great crew a vastly improved experience which made the poor seating and lack of room not as bad after all. For extra comfort we purchased our own pillows and did not bother blowing up the neck ring! Departure and arrival times where spot on. The I-pad tablets are just OK can't wait for the 767's to retire and the 787 coming into service!,1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. Terrible service, when I was trying to check my bag the ladies from the Jetstar staff didn't even approach me or the rest of the people looking for help. They had a horrible attitude and they looked so upset if you called them for help. Seriously, if they don't want to do their job they shouldn't be there. I had to also paid an extra $60 because I exceeded 2 kg. What a rip off. I definitely won't fly with Jetstar ever again. My first experience with Jetstar was horrible.",1
Flew Indigo from Delhi to Bangalore and return. I have used Indigo several times over the years and the years and they have yet to disappoint me. I was particularly amazed at the great customer service and the cabin crew's happy attitude towards the customers. On-ground check in was fast and easy. Transfer from T3 (international terminal) at Delhi to the domestic terminal was a breeze this time around. Super clean planes. Will strongly recommend for travel for domestic flying in India.,0
Singapore to Bangkok. My luggage was damaged. Counter at the airport was closed as there were no more flights from AirAsia. Wasted an hour on the phone trying to contact their customer service and received forms to fill up for the to even begin processing my request. The hoops you have to jump though in order to get a token refund from this airline is appalling. I found out that they have removed their review feature from their Facebook page.,1
Flew SIN-TPE-SIN. Both flights used old B777s. Everything was okay except for the web check-in which they don't have. Oh they have but you have to pay for this very basic/necessary service.,0
BKK-SIN out April 28th return May 31st. Very disappointing in most ways. Poor food selection poor rambling hard to understand communication inexperienced and abrupt service from a small but significant number of the flight and ground crew. It sets out to be cool and trendy and ends up feeling shabby. Poor staff training and on the ground service levels are simply too poor to match the ideals.,1
"Sydney to Taipei via Manila. My experience with Cebu Pacific was horrible, and I will never consider flying them again. Over the course of 4 flights we experienced, a flight cancellation, two delayed flights, a scammy feeling bag search, a freezing cold airplane, the worst meals I've been served in flight, being locked into a departure lounge in Manila and to top it off damaged luggage. The flight from Taiwan to Manila was cancelled, they sent a friendly email saying there was an issue and they'd call us, The resulting call was on the Tuesday where they informed us that our Friday flight was cancelled (no indication of that in the email) and we could rebook. Our rebooking options were:  a flight that left in 5 hours time (1am Wednesday morning), or a flight that left on the following Tuesday (eliminating half of our vacation). We had to make an emergency booking with a different airline at great expense due to their issue. The flight from Manila to Sydney was delayed by an hour. The return leg flight Manila to Taipei was delayed by almost 3 hours, (it took off after the projected arrival time) there was no compensation offered, breaking Philippine airline regulations. At Ninoy Aquino Airport Terminal 3 we went through security, emptying our drink bottles, the Airport water fountains were empty/broken. At the boarding gate there was a bag search by airline staff emptying water bottles a second time to ensure that during the delay at the gate (with no bathroom access) and on the flight you would only have access to water you could purchase from the airline at ludicrous prices. Boarding the flight in Manila the aircon was on so high it looked like and felt like it was snowing presumably to increase blanket sales. The meals on the flight were terrible - Chicken Tangalad was a measly portion of oily chicken and indeterminate vegetables with far too much rice, Chicken Tocino was basically the same thing but with egg instead of vegetables. Our flight from Manila to Taipei was severely delayed (over 3 hours) after an hour and a half at the first gate a flight attendant yelled ""follow me"" and led a crowd of passengers to a different gate, then the airline staff placed a row of chairs in front of a door and locked all the passengers in, you could see passengers walk towards the entrance heading to the bathroom then turn around realizing they were trapped. Finally after arriving in Taipei one of the 2 suitcases we had checked was damaged, To summarize, the service was terrible, the flights were delayed, the food was barely edible.",1
"Bali to Singapore. AirAsia should do more for those who are afraid to fly during the COVID-19 period even if the said country is not under 'high alert' (for example Indonesia, which is greatly underestimated due to a lack of monitoring system in place). At least issue some sort of voucher for future use. I will not fly with AirAsia anymore. There is no way to talk or contact a physical live person.",1
"Cebu to Manila. We booked 5 flights with Cebu Pacific during the month of May in order to get around the Philippines. Not one of them was on time. One delay caused us to miss our connecting flight and they refused to help us in any way forcing us to simply pay for another ticket and the overnight hotel as well as the hotel we were supposed to be staying in at our planned destination. All this even though we paid for their ""insurance"" which is a total scam. The lack of efficiency is actually baffling. It is acceptable if a flight is delayed for mechanical or weather related reasons, however most of the times our delay was because they did not even have the plane at the airport at the scheduled time of departure. The difference between this airline and Phillipine Airlines is actually eye opening. Please if you have the choice and want a stress free holiday, do not book this airline.",1
"Jetstar Airways continues to excel in its field. With carry on only, this was one of the easiest flights I have taken in many years from Launceston to Sydney. The Cabin Crew were, as usual, courteous and efficient. I found seat 17F a little tight as compared to my previous A321 seat 12A (no seat in front). I don't think that seat pitch varies from A320 to A320. For less than two hours, this was not a problem. I did not purchase food or drink, and declined the scratch card offer (quite difficult to redeem). I will continue to fly Jetstar, and I highly recommend this LCC.",0
Check-in was good meals were atrocious and not what we ordered. After an argument with cabin steward that I certainly did not order beef stew for 6am she got me what I originally ordered (croissants). The meals were awful very oily etc but the Toblerone and soft drinks was good. Take your own snacks and drinks they don't care. I got a free 'gift' of an hours free wifi on board but could not use after 4 attempts to get someone to help me and 3 different cabin crew members telling me they were busy and would come back to me soon I gave up. Staff were useless and unfriendly. Shame because the price is good and seats were fine etc. We also left on time and no delays. Would I fly with them again? The price would have to be amazing and I would be better prepared.,1
"I was travelling on IdiGo Flight number 6E2643 from Delhi to Pune. When the Plane taxied, I started feeling uneasiness as I am a diabetic patient. Since the flight was about to take off, I informed my acute discomfort to Flight Cabin Crew Ms. Saroj (in turn she reported to lead Flight Cabin Crew Ms. Roshani who immediately handed me over 2 pouches of Sugar & a pack of Hide & Seek biscuits. I consumed it immediately as the flight took off. By the time, we achieved the flight Service altitude, Ms. Roshani again checked with me on my comfort & also offered further help by providing the breakfast which was not ordered at the time of ticket booking.  What a helping hand by Ms. Roshani, Hats off to her presence of mind & promptness of the service offered. On landing at Pune, Ms. Roshani ensured that I am absolutely on my own & wished me a great stay at Pune. In short, Ms. Roshani & IndiGo Team saved me & a ""would-be"" inconvenience to co-passengers by extending the swift helping hand to me & ensured that I am safe & healthy.  Rest assured on my being an IndiGo fan for rest of my life.",0
"This marks the second time in a week that I've had an unpleasant encounter with AirAsia. During the previous flight from Penang to Langkawi, they refused to check in our luggage, citing our arrival 45 minutes past the departure time. Despite being at the KLIA2 counter two hours in advance, successfully checking in our luggage, and passing the hand carry luggage check this time, they insisted on an additional 15 kg. However, at the counter, they refused to add the luggage, once again using the 45-minute rule as an excuse. The staff impoliteness led to us missing the Miri flight, and we had to secure an alternative flight through Malaysian Airlines.",1
Auckland to Honolulu via Sydney. Auckland checkin people helped with an issue with my flights (ended up with two ref numbers) so the issue was to correct them so my luggage transferred (both routes where with Jetstar). Auckland to Sydney went well with no issues. The next flight I didnt have food booked and it was difficult to find someone to fill my water bottle on the flight. In Honolulu my luggage was missing and its been almost impossible to speak to anyone from customer services. My delayed luggage was reported and since Im flying onward to an area not covered by Jetstar I was told it would be to expensive for them to forward my luggage that their lost (so Im starting to think Ill never see that again).,1
Flew IndiGo November 11 to Kolkota from Bangkok. A full flight. On time takeoff very friendly and accommodating staff seats are ok cabin and toilets clean. Been flying IndiGo on and off the past few years and this has been my usual experience. Never tried the food but the cabin staff at least on this flight constantly asked - even though I never ordered any food - if I needed water each time the food cart went past.,0
"Flew Adelaide to Sydney. I understand that Jetstar is a budget airline, and that the best quality of customer service, flight comfort, and safety cant be expected. However, its extremely unreasonable to do carry on baggage weight checks at the gate and not at the check-in outside of security, and then require passengers to pay 60 dollars to check in a bag. Had we been given this option, we would have put more weight into our actual checked luggage that still has extra room in it. Had we been given fair notice of this, then we could have easily gone back out of security and added more to our checked bag. The staff at the gate were extremely rude and not willing to explain why we couldnt just add our bag to our checked bag weight allowance, or why the bags that people were being forced to check in were all the charged the same price when they were all different sizes and weights. We had a customer service agent rudely address us, and I boarded the plane feeling Id been robbed. I know that this wont change any of Jetstars backward policies, but I hope that in the future, Jetstar is more prudent about how it goes about monitoring the weight going onto the plane. Dont use these methods to try and squeeze more money out of your passengersits wrong.",1
"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore with Scoot. In March 2016 I booked a return fare to Bangkok for myself and my wife for a Scoot flight in October 2016. I received an email from Scoot around September changing the return date from 30/10/16 to 1/11/16. Unfortunately as a result I was unable to take the booking. The email from Scoot advised that they would refund the return trip cost. I have called them twice for the refund, each time taking at least 15-20 minutes to get through to their Philippine call centre. But still no refund. I am a frequent flyer member with Singapore Airlines and have flown with them often, found them so efficient. How can you associate themselves with Scoot, It brings them down.",1
"Returning as cheaply as possible Perth to Bangkok. Booked 2 weeks before the flight on 17th, COVID-19 was already disrupting transport, Singapore was days from closing Changi, and Thailand obviously close to closing BKK and I was using visa exempt so concerned. No problem at check in, flight left on time, guess 15% full. I regard Scoot as really too good for a cheapo, seat is same as full service airline, of course no drink, food, entertainment, and only 10kg but I pay to be transported. In Changi told that flight SIN to BKK was consolidated 4 x 320 into 1, so an 8 hour delay, a potential refund was mentioned but no use to myself to be stuck in Singapore. Good flight 320 to BKK about half full and on time and allowed into Thailand, phew! BKK empty, through immigration and in taxi before ETA. Actually better than usual good Scoot flights as flight crew not so insistent of pushing expensive food, coffee, drinks, guess they were all on notice, I wish them well and base my 10/10 of their consolidating my flight as driven by economic necessity. Hope they survive and in a similar way.",0
SIN-MEL. Very disappointed by the performance of the cabin crew. For a flight of only 6.5 hours the crew took 2 hours 45 mins to serve drinks/dinner and 1.5 hours to serve breakfast. Bear in mind that this is a low cost airline and meals etc are only provided to those who are prepared to pay at the time of serving. I took a good look at the number of passengers who did purchase meals and there were not many therefore the serving times should have been a lot faster than they were. In between serving the crew made no attempt to contain their noise coming from the galley. Probably the most disruptive flight I have been on and for a change it was not the passengers who were the cause. Perhaps a review of the serving processes is required to help speed this up. No respect to passengers on this night flight.,1
"Had to dump in the bin before boarding because we were over 1kg - 1 swimsuit because it was wet, pack of chips that we could have ate prior to the flight or on the flight, would still have still been added weight either way on the plane and a pair of joggers so that we didnt have to pay the over weight charge of $65. Then we hop on the plane, take our seats awaiting takeoff with the plane near full apart from a couple of seats at the rear where we were seated. As we waited air hostess tells us we are in the opposite seats and asked that due to Covid thought it better that we sat where we were rather than squeeze in with another person. Told after flight took off we could sit in the seats that we were in - really Jetstar you have no idea with social distancing, but would rather put everyone in a cattle style seating.",1
"Flew Ho Chi Minh to Manila with Cebu Pacific. Typical budget carrier, no free seevice of snacks or even water. Friendly crew, clean cabin, no inflight entertainment, no pillows and blankets for a night flight. Seat comfort is zero, especially if you above 510, no leg room at all, my legs still pained 3 days after.",1
Air Asia website has taken such a step backwards it's infuriating. No customer service to top it off. Trying to book seats on the plane and keep getting payment / booking error trying 3 different credit cards and the same issue again and again,1
Air Asia India: Traveled from Delhi to Bangalore on May 23rd. One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.,1
"I traveled from Bangalore to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur in October this year by AirAsia and AirAsia X.  The booking experience was fine. Had already registered on their website for a domestic flight earlier. While planning my trip researched on Internet and found out they had this sale where Tickets were priced less than half of Others. Without a second thought booked two for me and my wife. While booking came to know that Checked in baggage and meals need a Surcharge. But even then two tickets cost me Rs 70000 for return with 1 checked in baggage and 4 Meals which was Super Value. I had to pay for seat selection with my wife while web checkin or if I wanted extra leg space. The flights arrived and departed on schedule, flights were clean, Flight attendants were properly dressed and spoke English.  Food served was average and I discovered I had to pay more in Indian rupees while pre-booking while it cost less in Malaysian currency inflight. Toilets were clean. AirAsia X flight from KUL to MEL was a widebody jet. There was no entertainment system. Seats were tight for me (6 feet) but my wife (5/6) was alright. Had 7 and 5 hours lay over at KLIA terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur which is fine for Shopping  and Eating and even has a low cost Samasama hotel where we rested for few hours. Overall I got what I paid for. I recommend planning and booking in advance to book in their frequent sales and making most of it.",0
"Checked in online the day before flying through their new beta online check-in system. On the day of departure I had unforeseen delays so would arrive after check-in counter closed but well before the gate closed. Tried the webchat to check if there would be any issues. Agent stopped responding despite my repeated attempts to get a reply (over the course of more than twenty minutes). When I arrived at the airport I ran to the counter and was told I could still get a boarding pass if I had checked in online before check-in closure. The agent checked my passport and said I was not checked in. I tried to show her my confirmation on my phone but she would not look at it. Then I tried to call the customer care line in Malaysia on their website and it does not work. I later received an e-mail that I had missed my flight and that I need to call customer care through a number listed in a link, when I clicked the link it didnt work.",1
"Poor Jetstar check in staff at Christchurch Airport. It was terrible service to guest. I added the wheelchair service for my grandma but they didn't prepare staff or the wheelchair. I brought it from outside by myself and even then, they were asking me to take her to aircraft. Ok, I understand it gets busy, but when I arrive at the boarding area, they made me wait and boarding at the last. It was 7am flight, and I'm really disappointed in Jetstar service.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The check in was quite long and the ground staff not fast to handle. The flight initially was on time, but by the time we were onboard the aircraft, the pilots said that the air conditioner was not working and we need to wait for another 30 minutes. The flight in the end was delayed by around 1 hour. The cabin crews did not greet the passengers and involved in their own conversations. The food that I ordered was quite nice, which is nasi lemak. Overall, the flight was quite disappointing as the flight was delayed and the cabin crew not that friendly. It was worse than my previous AirAsia flights.",0
Flew MEL-LST. Arrived early at airport only to be told we weren't able to use the bag drop. Check-In staff were rather rude. Plane was old and dirty. Flight landed 5 mins late. Cabin Crew were quite good. Overall you are better off flying Virgin.,1
"We were boarded onto a Jetstar flight from Adelaide to Melbourne. Just before departure, the pilot advised that we were required to change planes. We disembarked and went to another gate which had a plane at the gate which was unable to fly due to a fault. Jetstar then reloaded the first plane with customers travelling from Adelaide to Cairns. Extremely deceptive behaviour. Jetstar are  trying to say it was a safety reason but the first plane left for Cairns. Jetstar staff stated that the changed occurred so the Cairns flight could return to Adelaide before the curfew.",1
"Sydney to Honolulu with Jetstar. The flight was cancelled without notice. I flew all the way to Sydney from Perth early in the morning. When I got off the plane, first thing I saw on the screen was that the flight was cancelled. I wasn't even notified and no suggestions from Jetstar besides stay in Sydney for another 2 days to get the earliest possible Jetstar aircraft to Honolulu. I ended up booking another flight to Honolulu after getting to Brisbane at my own cost. I will never use this airline again.",1
Clark to Cebu. Check in counter is not yet open even if already almost an hour before our boarding time. Your staffs here in Clark are not helpful nor accommodating!,1
"All of us know that we have to be in airport at least 2.5 hours before check in. We were supposed to check in together with a flight to Narita as well. However, when its our turn to check in at counter, all the Cebu Pacific counters are giving priority to Narita flight. Why is this so? All of us have the responsibility and self discipline to be punctual and be answerable for our own actions. The fact that the Singapore flight check in have to be side-lined, then who would want to come on time for check in? The later you come, the earlier you get to check in. Seeing many passengers who are in the same predicament as me, I decided to shame Cebu Pacific. Their senior customer service instead of apologizing, cited that Narita boarding gate is closing soon. Is this my problem? We are not talking about a few passengers whom we need to give way. 30 passengers! For what? When Cebu Pacific promote people to manage the counters, its really by seniority and not by brains. Why dont they split the counters to accommodate for both routes? Only idiots take the easiest way out of trying to solve the problem at one go. Cebu Pacific is never the airline you would want to take. Your interests and rights can be compromised at their discretion.",1
"I did not get to take my flight due to COVID-19. I was provided with a flight voucher, however, after later submitting a complaint to Jetstar I was informed I was not eligible for a refund. Despite raising a number of queries regarding the inconsistent information I was provided and requesting specific details regarding the complaints process, they never responded to my concerns. Further to this, I requested the details of the ombudsmen to which the staff would not respond to. Despite multiple request for return contact, Jetstar refused. Finally after escalating my complaint to the ombudsmen, it was confirmed I was eligible for a refund. I was not advised at the time that this was an option. Jetstar refused to include information that was pertinent to the decision making process which has impacted the financial outcome. Jetstar refuse to respond to this complaint. Jetstar's complaints team continue to refuse any call back requests. By neglecting to include important decision making information, Jetstar has not met community standards of communication.",1
July 16th Bangkok Don Muang to Phuket. Last year we arrived 20 minutes before departure at Don Muang airport in Bangkok (very difficult to reach during rush hour). There where several queues and we asked some Air Asia ground personnel if they could help. They helped us and about one minute before departure we entered the plain. Arriving in Phuket our luggage was also in good condition and well kept by the aircraft personnel. I think that Air Asia is worth the money.,0
"Gold Coast to Christchurch. Very pleased with our return flight with Jetstar both legs were on time the plane was spotless, and the service and friendliness of the crew were exemplary.",0
"Manila to Dumaguete. Absolutely the worst airline I have ever encountered in over 40 years of world travel. I have multiple bad experiences with this airline since I live in the Philippines. Here's the latest. Arrived at their check-in kiosk with 50 minutes till flight time. After waiting in line for 5 minutes, it wouldn't allow me to check in, said to see a gate agent. Then waited in line for agent for 10 minutes. She would not give us boarding passes, because we weren't there within 45 minutes of departure time. (Note that the flight departure was delayed over an hour). Our only option was to pay a 4000 peso rebooking fee to get on the next flight, at 4AM the following day.",1
"AirAsia flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 26 January, it was a short, full flight and boarding was quick. Legroom fine and comfortable at seat 23A, crew looks tired and wanted to finish their duty quickly. I did not hear the pilot make any announcement regarding the flight path etc. If it was not the perfect flight schedule selection for this route I would not fly with them tentatively.",0
CNX-KUL and PEN-BKK. For the price and bearing in mind this is a low cost carrier then very good. Pre-ordered food on CNX-KUL arrived without hitch - as did flights and luggage. Delay ex PEN due to storm but part made up despite flight being only 1hr 15mins. Seats are a little cramped but to be expected and overall a very good product. Crews all good and despite full loads relaxed and charming.,0
"Brisbane to Sydney. Staff and rude, pushy and aggressive. This airline is cheap and nasty. Planes are uncomfortable and dirty. Although flights arent considerable cheaper than other airlines, they look for ways to charge extra at every point of the trip (baggage weight, food purchases, charity donations). Fly this airline as a last resort.",1
"Saigon to Melbourne. We got no email for the delay and arrived at the airport for our 1030pm flight. At 945pm, they announced flight delayed to 0030 (2 hours delay) Around 11 pm, we received an email confirming plane delay til 1730pm next day (total of 19 hours delay). Told us to leave and pick up all our luggage and ask us to head to the hotel they provided. I saw they took the plane away. Waiting for the luggage in disappointment. Cancelled 2 of my meetings for work. Still waiting.",1
Male to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. The airline rescheduled our ticket and sent an email with the new itinerary. Upon trying to speak to a customer representative we get this virtual assistant to chat with which keeps on sending automated response based on what we were typing. Then we are send on another page but the page keeps on loading. The airline cancelled our original flight and gave us a transit of 20 hours from KL to Perth. we asked to be given a hotel to freshen us up but they kept on sending us from here to there without any concrete actual help. We emailed them but no answer about the accommodation.,1
"Booked Scoot from Singapore to Perth as it had the best arrival time in Perth than any other flight on the day we needed to travel. Had read previous reviews and was honestly dreading the flight as they had been largely negative. We were pleasently surprised that the seats were roomy, staff pleasant and organised, the flight took off on time and landed on time. The inflight service was as you expect from a budget airline. It was a very good flight. It's a budget airline, we found it good value maybe we are not as precious about air travel as some. But not as bad as some of the reviews would have you believe.",0
"Recently as an international travel booked return flight, continue to experience problems of scheduling and rescheduling by the airline, with no head or tail. Difficult to contact either online or web chat or on the phone to speak to customer service from abroad from abroad. The whole service is below par.",1
Gold Coast to Sydney. Staff were rude and dismissive while trying to check in and ask questions. Then got told at gate we need to pay extra for baggage that we could have checked in. Staff noted that we were told 3 times on the check in machine - that quickly passed through warnings.,1
"Im very upset with the customer service I received. I booked a flight through Jetstar for the first time to fly from Hawaii to New Zealand and because of Covid-19, Jetstar has to cancel my flight to New Zealand and gave me a voucher instead of a returned payment. During these hard times where I am currently out of a job and trying to pay my rent, I called to see if I could get a refund and had very poor customer service. The man I spoke with continuously talked over me and said its a non refundable ticket. I booked with Hawaiian airlines for my return flight which was also non refundable and they gave me a full refund because THEY had to cancel my flight. It is the right thing to do and I will never fly with this airline. People are in need of money right now. The right thing to do is return peoples money when Jetstar has to cancel my flight due to border closures. Terrible, terrible company.",1
"Terrible sequence of events, showing this airline has problems. 1) delayed 4+hrs ex SIN 2) missed connex in MEL due delay std1200 3) New connex flight cancelled at 4.10pm 4) On arrival in MEL, 30min delay to de-plane aircraft due no staff to position airbridge 5) Baggage delayed 1hour due staff shortages (including multiple carousel changes) 6) 1 hour queue to re-book connexion 7) Connexion flight delayed till 9.20pm due no seats 8) Overall arrival delay in Brisbane 10.5+ hours. Flights themselves average with not much inflight service apart from minimum.",1
"Singapore to Melbourne. Absolutely disgusted to find that our seats 1A and 1C, that were booked in February, had been changed to 3A and 3C. Complained at the desk in Singapore who just stalled for time until our flight was called. Advised that at boarding gate they will assist us, of course they can't help, as seats were already taken. On our return to Melbourne I complained and was advised that I was sent an email in July regarding a merge with Tiger. Although our flight, date and time did not change apparently our seats did, which we weren't aware of. They mentioned something about an upgrade at Singapore and after reading the review of 12 August, it appears our seats we booked were sold to a higher bidder. My advice fly Scoot but don't expect seats you book and pay for. Scoot are unapologetic and ground staff, either ignore you or use other time wasting tactics until flight is called.",1
Daytime flight to Bali. Straight after lunch they turned all the lights off? When asked for a drink (just one) the flight attendant seemed like it was a chore! But they weren't busy as three of them were chatting in the galley. Business Class was much like 'cattle' Class. No leg room. The man in front of me reclined right back leaving me with no room. When my husband had to go to the bathroom he had to ask the man in front of me to push his seat back up so he could get past ! We know that it is not Jetstar's fault that this man reclined but in a normal business class seat you would still have room to get past.,1
"This is a no frills airline as you know. But you get what you paid for. The seats were not comfortable, during the 3 hours that we were in the air that's the time I slept, Secondly the FA's were very chatty (they were chatting loudly) and the plane was not clean. However, I still recommend because it was very cheap.",0
"Delhi to Pune. My flight time was 0450 hrs, I reached the counter at 0410 but since you have to reach at 0405 they didn't let me board the plane, and I  missed my meeting. Never will book indigo again.",1
Flown from CCU-KUL (LCCT) and back. Comfortable flight. As with any low cost carrier you could buy food and drinks on board. The flight attendants were nice and friendly. Only down side was lack of inflight entertainment and poor leg room.,0
"Denpasar to Melbourne. Absolutely shocking experience, first time flying with Jetstar and will be the last. A cancelled flight leaving Melbourne, told there were engineering requirements. Not offered any apology or anything to make leaving easier - paid for a direct flight and was only offered flights with long stopovers. Once in Bali, hours before we were due to leave Jetstar cancelled our flight, again stating engineering requirements. A day later, again hours before we were due to leave Jetstar cancelled the flight, the 3rd flight in 2 weeks. Jetstar have been hopeless over the phone, it takes hours to get any result. They do not offer their customers anything to make the travel easier after the inconvenience they cause - still wanting to charge $4 for water or $20 for a blanket when finally on the plane! Would not waste my time or money on Jetstar again - they are so unrealiable!",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Bali. Our 1030 departure had a 7h delay. It took over an hour for staff to come to the gate to explain that the flight was delayed and to deal with customers. There were 3 of us that wanted to remove our baggage, be refunded and hop over to the other terminal to take a 1230 MAS flight to Bali instead but AirAsia took so long to get staff we realised we would never make it. Staff agreed to move us to a 1615 Air Asia flight to Bali however we had to go back outside to the chaos of baggage drop and immigration. After standing fighting for another hour, they eventually agreed to move our luggage over to the new flight without us having to do it all ourselves. They refused us access to the pod hotel in the departure lounge or their Lounge. They provided one bottle of water for 7h and offered a KFC in that time. Staff pushed us around the houses to talk to operations managers to try and obtain lounge access to relax.",1
"Flew from Mumbai to Bangalore last week. Opted for IndiGo as the timings were good, Check in was a little slow and so was boarding - their staff at the gates was asking people to check their bags in at the boarding gate so there was some confusion. The aircraft was a slightly older one. Seats were okay, since this was a corporate booking, got a XL seat over the wings. Meal was pre-added as a corporate booking perk - food was ok, had to remind the staff for a cup of tea. Never got one as when the crew did care to drop by, the pilot had already announced them to secure for landing.",1
Cairns-Sydney-Phuket in Business class. Was not allowed to sit in business class on the 3 hour domestic flight but was allocated an exit row on the A330. Not sure why we could not be seated in business like on the other A330 sector. No food or drinks offered on domestic sector. Seats in business are really premium economy and the only inflight entertainment option was an ipad that was only given out after the meal service. Crew were clearly disinterested and one almost barked at me when I dare go to the galley to ask for an apple juice as there were no drinks runs between the services on this 9.5 hour flight.,1
Flew SIN-SYD-SIN in August 2012 with my family (2 adults and 2 children). No complaints and definitely value for money. We did a comparison with their RED competitor for flights on the same sectors on the same days and the difference is mind boggling! Can't say the same thing for the lasagne though which is probably the worst among the good experience we had! Another annoying thing is that the call button will forever be triggered by someone accidentally being located at the armrest.,0
We decided to go for a quick vacation within the state as we did not want to take any chances travelling outside any state and chose to go to Mangalore which was a 50 minute short journey. Check in was smooth and the bag drop was done quickly aswell. The flight boarding started ahead of time and the flight load was on the higher side. Departure and arrival were well ahead of schedule and Indigo did the job of transporting from point A to point B. The pilots updated the passengers on the flight details which was appreciated but it seems the crew were rushed with their announcements.,0
"BNE-TSV 18th August on A320. Assigned the same seat as someone else - I was willing to change to a spare window seat but the crew made the other person (and his wife) move because of ""zoning"" (for meals?). This left an empty middle seat for the flight. Pushed out ahead of time landed a few minutes early - the estimated flight time was way off (about 10 minutes in a 2 hour flight). Seats very comfortable for short trip - wider than I expected and plenty of legroom. However there are no pockets to store loose items such as books or cameras. Beverage service non-existent unless you paid for it - I was expecting at least free tea and coffee for all as one of the conditions in the booking I made but that didn't happen. Cheap price for the fare but this cheapened the actual flight experience. At least I got a free mug of water when I asked for it. Didn't bother with an entertainment iPad. Safety briefing fine but in-flight announcements from the flight deck were somewhat muffled and almost totally inaudible as a result. Good value for money and I would recommend on that basis alone.",0
Read review by L Stephens 27 April and it reads the same as what happened to me. Flight 3K131 Singapore Perth 3 June 1755. Flight delayed then cancelled rescheduled to next morning 4 Jun 4.45am. Given $13 food voucher. So spent 12 hours wandering and pondering at Changi Airport. Weather was excuse which is a very common cop out used by them as they delay and cancel on a regular basis. I know they are a no frills budget airline but they are gradually loosing support because they are unreliable. I have flown with them previously and found them good. Best budget airline is Southwest Air in the US.,1
"Tokyo Narita to Manila to the usual system is that once youre in the check in they weigh the check in & hand carry luggages. If the handcarry is too heavy, there will be an opportunity to move stuff to the check in. The lady at the counter didnt do so, so we assumed that everything was ok. Once we got to immigration, the officer started checking the weight of our luggage. Ive never seen an immigration officer check the weight for airlines because each airline have different standards. This was already sketchy to us because it felt like a scam. This didnt give anyone an opportunity to rearrange the luggage to suit the required weight and you would have no other choice BUT to pay for the extra weight. 2nd JPN-MNL we still havent flown but Im just really disappointed with Cebu Pacific so Im writing this. Aside from the flight being delayed for an expected 4 hours and more, we had to pay 2900 yen for our check in luggage. Apparently we only paid check in luggage for one way (MNL-JPN) and we didnt do so the other way. But when I did the online check in, I clearly saw that we had one check in baggage. The lady said that she cant find it in the system and that we would have to take it up in the Philippines. We tried to explain that this was an online booking and if she cant find it in the system. Most likely they wont be able to find it in their system too. Assuming that they run the same system. So we paid and the lady said we should just try to get reimbursed. We left the counter and my mom realized that we didnt get a receipt. We went back to get it because they didnt accept any forms of card and only accepted cash. We almost couldnt pay for it since we didnt think wed have to pay again. Without the receipt, we have no proof that we paid for the check in luggage. No cards, just cash? Really? I understand that cash is a necessity at places that dont have the proper technology or whatever. But this is an airline that should accommodate every person, especially when they start adding up costs. The point is, this entire airline seems like they are running a scam and I am so disappointed. Needless to say, I will be warning all my family and friends about this airline. Id rather pay a little bit more for a better airline.",1
Had the misfortune of flying Business class from Brisbane to Phuket. Booked to fly out of Brisbane at 8am and arrive in Phuket at 10.30pm the same day. We checked our bags in the morning and by 11am the following day Jetstar had managed to get us to Melbourne with no luggage. I understand that issues with delayed and cancelled flights can and do happen but the total lack of communication was unacceptable. Staff basically didn't want to know us and we were left stranded. Totally unacceptable especially for a business class customer.,1
Cooloongatta to Sydney. Understand luggage limit of 7 kg. We were over each by about half kilo. We had paid for extra 20 kilo each hold storage but figured we didnt need it. We were charged $60 extra for what was a minor difference and was not allowed to consider what we had paid and not used in hold. The attitude was aggressive and most unpleasant. Why any organisation would wish to alienate their customers this way beggared belief Never again jet star. It was not only what happened but the officious way in which it was done. Talk about brand damage!,1
Very cheap flight BNK-SYD (9am) from a small airport so straight forward boarding process with mobile sms boarding pass via online check-in and no check in baggage. Smooth but impersonal as one would expect for a true budget/shuttle style flight. Seats comfortable new design with seat pocket elevated to the top of the seat improves legroom and perception of space. An area of improvement for this and other Jetstar flights would be limiting the ridiculous amount of carry-on they encourage people to bring on board. Compounded by the lack of assistance stowing it. A little supervision here would go a long way.,0
"Worst experience ever. After reading many comments I realize that I am now one of many, but do yourself a favor and never fly Jetstar Airways no matter the price. Hidden fees plus no service plus lousy attitude. Admired to making lose our flight by their mistake and our compensation was not charging us extra to catch the next flight. Flew with them four times while in Australia and problems every time.",1
"New Delhi to Muscat via Mumbai was an horrific experience.  I booked Delhi-Muscat ticket on Indigo website. They had a flight via Mumbai where flight was to be changed. The ticket was under single PNR, I confirmed with customer care if the luggage will be through checked in & he confirmed it would be done. But at the time of check in, the officer denied & started asking me the name of person who confirmed. Now, who remembers the name of customer care executive! So, I had to take the luggage in Mumbai & check-in again. With no other option, I did take the luggage. The gap between the 2 flight was of about 3 hours. I was supposed to be transferred to International airport. When I asked the ground staff to arrange transfer, they were clueless & asked me to go out, hire a taxi & leave. I got upset, but instead of helping me, the Mumbai ground staff kept on arguing. The taxi took a good time to reach International airport, as it was peak hour. Finally we could make it just in time only to find that the flight was delayed. This is the first time I have seen that international flight booked under one PNR from an airline website. No through check-in, No transfers,when both the flights are from same airline. Basic flight, No service, No entertainment, expensive Food.",1
"Smooth experience from check-in until arrival at the destination. The flight are on time and proper boarding announcements and arrangements. The are no IFE but we can connect to wifi for entertainment - the wifi connection was pretty bad. Food was modest. Smooth take-off and landing. Kudos to the flight crew. Overall, very moderate experience with this airline.",0
"We have just returned to Sydney from Singapore after a marvellous three-week holiday flying both ways with Scoot. Being a budget-type airline we had no high expectations and were satisfied with both journeys: Sydney to Singapore and Singapore to Sydney. On our forward journey we had chosen the economy blue seats 38A and 38B - and we had a passenger sitting near us on 38C. Found it very cramped. Decided to upgrade for the return journey to the yellow seats and must say that the extra room was well worth the extra payment. I would travel again with Scoot  next time booking the super economy (yellow) seats. With such low air fares you get what you pay for so we can't whinge about being offered coca cola and pringles as a snack! The meal on the return journey (beef wrap) was a huge improvement on the forward journey which was some sort of very ordinary rice concoction. The staff at every step of the way - from when we checked in until we landed were very efficient and courteous. In recommending this airline I would suggest that potential passengers do a bit of homework beforehand and choose a seat that maximises their comfort. The small cabin directly behind business class (rows 21 to 23) are excellent as it is a small cabin which has been declared ""child and baby free"" - so no screaming babies directly nearby. Hope this has been helpful.",0
"Scoot refuses to follow their own refund policy for delayed flights. Trapped in the airport transit for 14 hours. I don't expect much from a low fare airline, but the way the handle their customers is not satisfactory. Our flight from Singapore to London via Bangkok, and according to my booking confirmation, we would remain seated for the short stop in BKK. In reality we landed in Bangkok, everyone had to leave the plane, go through security and then back into the plane 30 mins later. Then we sat there in the plane for 1 hour without much information before the pilot tells us that the plane (787) is not airworthy due to a mechanical error, and they need to organise a new plane. Then we were given a voucher for food and told that a new plane was set up at 8pm, then they said 11pm, then 12am (14 hours later). Everyone had to leave the plane, go through security before scrambling to figure out what to do next. According to their website ""when a flight has been delayed (retiming is the word they use) by more than 4 hours, we have 3 choices: voucher, refund or change flight date."" Fair enough, I want to change the date. But according to airport information, there is no Scoot counter or Scoot staff in the airport until 12 hours later, so calling Scoot is the only possibility other than waiting 12 hours. So I call Scoot twice, because the first operator got disconnected and I have no way of getting back to him, so I have to queue 10 mins again. After explaining that the plane I'm waiting 14 hours for is not currently up in the air, but is in fact delayed (they were clueless and kept on insisting that I must be on the plane, in the air), they would not allow me to change or cancel my flight. Why? Because I am in transit, and if I wanted a refund/change, I should have done it before taking off from Singapore (I obviously didn't know the plane was going to be delayed back then, and I was even told we would not disembark in Bangkok). I ask the airport information counter, and they insist that because there is no Scoot staff at the airport, I cannot leave the airport.",1
"Hyderabad to Bengaluru. Travel time, check in procedure, check out procedure and baggage collection are smooth and good. Inside flight service is not good. Our company has booked the ticket along with meals as well. I am not aware of it. I didn't check my boarding pass properly for special service. Crew members did not inform me about my meals while going to Bangalore. In return journey to Hyderabad they provided 1 cookies box (Rs.50/-). +1coke (Rs.100/-). We pay more money for meals at the time of booking, while not receiving the service we paid for.",0
"Udaipur to Mumbai. Beautiful blue plane, one of the best low cost airlines in India. route goes to every corner of India. Flew from a small city to Mumbai, the whole journey was excellent from staff welcoming on board until landing. On time as well. There is no reason to give a score under 10. Worth this price.",0
"Flew Kota Bharu to Kuala Lumpur. Air Asia have made a lot of improvements especially in terms of punctuality. Staff were friendly. They even took the initiative to wish one of the passengers a happy birthday through an announcement. Cabin was clean, flight was on time and more importantly super value for money. The only thing lacking is probably inflight entertainment - but you dont really need it for such a short distance journey.",0
"Flew Kuala Lumpur to Penang with AirAsia. The airline generally offers a great price for my distance I have to travel. However, the cabin crew doesn't really greet us while we board the aircraft which makes us feel a little bit unwelcome. The legroom is also below average but fortunately it is just a very short flight.",0
I use Indigo regularly to fly BKK-DEL. Great airline with great fares! Easy to navigate website with no hidden costs. Never had any delays actual departure in many cases before the scheduled departure time. Extremely friendly and cheerful crew. Only complaint the rather expensive food and drink onboard and not accepting Indian currency on international flights.,0
"My flight to Brisbane was cancelled due to weather, I had a flight to Mackay the following morning departing at 8.55 am. They were not able to connect me with another flight. After being on the phone and waiting in line for over an hour all they would offer me was a Jetstar voucher stating they could not give a monetary refund. My wife spoke to them and informed them the reason for my trip was to visit my terminally ill father they requested a hospital statement before they would issue a refund. They also offered me a voucher for the flight I would miss tomorrow. I then had to pay $400 for a flight with another airline. I will never fly with Jetstar again. They are callous, uncaring and unprofessional.",1
"One of worst flight operators. They delay flight just 1-3 hours before schedule depature. Once the fight is near delayed departure time, they will delay it further. They are highly unprofessional and money minded and don't care for any customer. People also don't have options as they are the biggest domestic operators. They shamelessly make money from every thing in flight. You pay for boarding, seats, meals. Im surprised why they have not started charging for using the lavatories.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. JetStar has the most horrendous service, they cancel flights and delay passengers so they can fill plane all the time and I dont understand how this is legally or ethically seen as acceptable by a business but also under Australia law. The staff are uncaring and rude probably because they have to lie through their teeth on a daily basis. My flight has been delayed by over an hour and as Im sitting here looking on the board it is blatantly obvious that two flights have been crammed together. This is not ok. Never flying with this horrendous airline ever again. Highly recommend you dont either.",1
"Denpasar to Jakarta. Had unpleasant time with Lion Air, both their system or their reaction in handling problem. I have bought the ticket and did web check in/online check in, I bought 2 seats and check in together. And then when we arrived at airport and went to counter to check in luggage the Lion Air officer said very leisurely that one of our seat is not available anymore and the flight was full already. They said their system didn't received out web check in data so the seat now is not available anymore.  And furthermore we have successfully checked in and we didn't late came to airport. Then they give many unreasonable reasons and the officer even said this is not their fault. After long wait and many debate, last minute they let us in to the airplane. We are very disappointed with this unpleasant experience. And we feel really insecure to fly with Lion Air again in the future.",1
"Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. I had paid for FF package so checkin was smooth even though baggage allowance was 20kg on ticket but they allow me to carry extra as a result my one hand bag went inside so i was free to walk on airport. I got checkin lounge where i can rest and have some food at odd hours and went to gate, boarding was already open one hour before departure and we were on our seat 30 minutes and gate close as every one had boarded. Boarding was smooth no drama. Flight was ready for take off and at that time it was advise that there is problem with aircraft and hence the flight need to abandon and change of aircraft and brought aircraft back to gate. Spend another 3 hours and finally took off. I can say that they had managed transition very smoothly. Aircraft were clean and toilets were clean too. staff were smiling and food was nice tea and upma which was preordered. Flight landed on time. Cant ask more on budget airline so it all depends upon what you pay upfront to get service.",0
"Denpasar to Bali. I had a ticket already purchased for Dec 27 to return to manila. I purchased an additional ticket to return really because of a family emergency. I checked in for the flight 2 hours before. Was waiting at the proper gate 30 min before boarding. The only available seat was with my back to the gate. I was surrounded by people all waiting for the only scheduled flight at that gate. I thought maybe a slight delay. All of a sudden everyone got up and responded to a gate change. When I approached the gate they said the gate was closed. The flight hasn't left yet but they refused to let me on. No other flight that day and said I was considered a no show. I was escorted out past immigration and just left there. I called the online customer service number and asked if they could rebook me for the next morning. Was given the runaround and told that nothing could be done. Even though I showed up at the proper time and went to the proper gate I was tricked into believing I was waiting with fellow passengers. Absolutely no compassion for my case with this company. So I purchased 2 tickets with this company, ended up using neither and was forced to purchase a flight with another company. Never again.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. This was an eight hour flight and I had three seats to myself. I was able to get some well earned rest on the flight. Boarding was good. Will fly AirAsia again.,0
"This was the worst flying experience Ive ever had. Before boarding we were told our luggage was 1 pound over the accepted weight limit and that we would have to pay 65 dollars to check it. This wouldnt have been a big deal, but the woman at the front desk was incredibly rude and told us the baggage was a safety hazard and wouldnt fit in the overhead luggage compartment. However, once we paid the 65 dollars, no one took our luggage and they just told us to bring it with us on the plane. Low and behold, our bags fit just fine, in the recommended position. They have standard baggage compartments that fit our standard bags just fine. And if there was any safety hazard, they bypassed it by having us board with our luggage anyway. Its just a stupid scam for money, and it was a confusing process to be lied to until we payed and then have everything magically be fine. Ive never experienced an issue with my bag size or weight ever before with any other airline, and I travel frequently. The flying experience was also horrible.  Overall, the customer service was awful, their policies are designed to scam their customers, and the flight itself was awful.",1
"This airline is by far the worst ever. None of the staff were helpful. They wont even answer your questions properly. I have flown a lot around the Philippines and all there flights are regularly delayed. After long line ups and disorganized booths, we were 5 minutes later than the cut off (3:10 for a 4:00pm flight) back to Manila. The staff did nothing to help when they could have, and made us pay for additional tickets for the a later flight. This was really horrible service as the airport very very small. And to make it even worst the flight we had to pay extra for got delayed be 1.5 hours.",1
"Return flights for August 2022, both changed to one that didn't work for me at all. Reason given was that getting me safely to my destination was their highest priority. Rejected the new flights and requested refund via their AVA bot. 3 days later, sent me email confirming the replacement flight booking that i had rejected. No way to contact other than ava bot. Messed up my travel plans and now adding to my problems.",1
I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. The flight was cancelled after we had boarded. We had to queue for hours for various things. Air Asia did the bare minimum to help.,1
"We arrived at the Bohol-Panglao Airport 2.5 hours prior to departure. The check in counter had 5 lanes open, and about 15 groups ahead of us. We did the online check in, and used the kiosk to print our bag tags. Did this save us any time? No.  We had to wait in the check in line for over an hour waiting on other passengers to adjust their bags to avoid paying extra baggage fees - if it was one group I would understand, but it was every single one of them, and the gate agents did nothing about this. Instead they played on facebook. When it is finally our turn the gate agent says we did the bag tags wrong and re does them the same way I did. He sends the first 2 bags to be loaded and continues to the next 2 bags. On the second 2 bags he puts a transfer ticket on them without telling us that he forgot to on the first 2 bags. We noticed it but he didn't think we did. After going thru security, we talked about it and came to the conclusion that we needed to talk to someone. We couldn't afford for these bags to be delayed so we asked the security agent who we should talk to. He directs us to go back thru security and talk to the supervisor. We asked 2 people for a manager, they refused to get a manager and offered to help themselves. When we expressed our concern they offered to check our bags and they went to the sorting area and came back stating that our bags have already been sealed and cannot be checked. We then went to a security manager to express our concern and we were able to finally talk to the desk manage. He told us he could pull the bags to check, but I'd he did, they will probably not make the flight.  We arrive to Manila and departed the plane and took a bus to terminal 3. We noticed that many passengers were not getting off the plane so we asked a stewardess if this bus was for transfers and she said yes, so we proceeded. We arrived on the bus in terminal 3 at the baggage claim and needed to be at terminal 4. Confused and short on time to catch our connecting flight we found the transfer desk after having to ask for directions. The agent at the counter didn't look up from her phone until we started filming and threatening to put the video on social media. Only then did she show us where the transfer bus was. We get to another agent at the bus transfer depot and he informed us that the bus had just departed and it would be at least 30 minutes till the next one, and by then we would miss our boarding cut off. He first tells us that we need to exit the terminal and take a cab. We asked if there is another option, because we really don't have time to go back thru security. He informed us that Cebu Pacific has a private shuttle they can call and that I need to go back to the transfer desk to make the request. I get back and the agent we spoke to before agreed to call this transfer. After about 15 minutes the shuttle arrived . We were then told that the shuttle does not have permission to take us thru the airport to get us to the other terminal, and we would have to exit the airport and drive around. We arrive at terminal 4 and still have to go thru security. We arrived 5 minutes before our scheduled departure time. when we arrived at terminal 4 we found out that our plane was delayed by 30 minutes, so the stress.",1
"Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore. Scoot cancelled our first leg of the flight - Bangkok to Singapore, without any reason or explanation and wouldn't even tell us when we were flying next until our third phone call! The lack of response was crazy. We finally got our delayed flight to Singapore the next day (and had to pay another night at a hotel as well as $70 in calling fees as they took so long). When we got to Singapore they still would not confirm our next flight. After a lot of persistence for 3 hours at Transfer desk they finally wrote a piece of paper with the flight no. and date, but no time or reference number to confirm we are definitely on that flight! We also paid for business class and they said all flights are full by the time we got there because we came on our""delayed"" flight which was their fault. Then they said to get our luggage at ""Lost and Found"" to stay overnight, and when we finally got there they couldn't find our luggage for 45 minutes!I'm still in Singapore now waiting for confirmation. I really need to get back home and they still won't confirm that I can definitely make it home by then! I can't believe the way they've treated everyone who's been messed around by their cancelled flights in Bangkok. Yet they're still not taking responsibility. I thought I'd try Scoot as they seemed not ""too bad"" and I took a chance, but never again Scoot.",1
"Auckland to Wellington. Rip off would not recommend this airline. I paid and bought extra 15kg for my flight. When I went to check in I was told to go to the gate. When I went to the gate they told me that my bag was 9kgs which is 2kgs over approved limit. The women at the gate was rude and didnt listen to me,  and said I had to pay $65 for the 2kgs. This was a 6am flight. Horrible customer service and this is how they make money by ripping people off.",1
"Tokyo to Manila. Airline will trick you. High baggage fees, no checked baggage allowance, 7K max carryon, over priced low class airline, does not accept credit cards at the counter for baggage that you dont know about. So you have to go out and get Japanese Yen and come back to the back of the line. If you can avoid this airline at all costs. Its cheaper to pay a little more for your ticket with checked baggage included for free. Cost me 40 dollars for 50 kilo of luggage.",1
Bangkok to Bali. I recently booked a flight with Air Asia through their website. I was very careful to uncheck as many of the automatically checked add-ons during the check-out process. There was one add-on for travel insurance that I missed. I was subsequently charged for travel insurance when it was not something I intended to purchase. I wrote to them requesting a refund that they promptly informed me that it was not possible as I did not untick the box for travel insurance. Why on earth would they require a customer to untick an add-on rather than ask them if they would like an add-on and have them initiate the add-on with a tick? I am truly disappointed that this is how they operate.,1
Ballina to Melbourne. Disgraceful service. Poor communication with all its customers from a cancelled flight to appalling after sales service. No care given to its obligations towards decent and basic customer service. I have had more issues with this airline than I could write in this review. This airline is budget for a reason. And that is that the customer service experience is one of limited care. Bad communication and poor basic common sense and customer appreciation. This airline could change its perception within the industry if it focused more on the customer and not the bottom line in its business model. The fact that due to unforeseen circumstances that a flight can be canceled is one thing and sometimes very understandable for what ever reason. The after sales service of having to deal with providing alternative accommodation would also not be easy. But to take its stranded passengers two hours away to a partner accommodation rather than support more local townships with this business and not having a plan available that can handle this situation is just poor business management. This is not the first time this has happened and the fact that this is still happening with this airline after multiple similar experiences in the past 20 years clearly states that they have no interest or intention to offer a good or moderate customer satisfaction experience. Jetstar you are poor poor poor in your customer experience within the Australian airline industry.,1
"Adelaide to Brisbane. I understand low cost airlines have to charge for things others provide for free but Jetstar cross the line into ripoff. My company purchased extra baggage and I fly weekly around Australia with one Cabin bag and one laptop bag. However as I didnt check the cabin bag Jetstar charged $65 for the cabin bag. I did explain that the bag goes on the same plane and that it was less work for them if I carry, but the opportunity for a fee was apparently too good to miss!",1
I was notified early in the morning that my return flight from Bangkok to Singapore had been rescheduled from 1700 to 1925. Since there were no updates during the day I made my way to the airport arriving with ample time to spare at 1630. I was shocked to be told at check-in that the flight was further delayed to 2235. Now I have no choice but to waste 6 hours with nothing more than a spurious apology from the ground staff who appeared just as blur as the frustrated passengers. My simple question to the airline why were there no updates after 0530 ..  is it not common courtesy and indeed normal procedure to keep passengers informed so that even if they cannot do anything about the delay at least they don't have to have salt rubbed in by having to waste time waiting in a crowded and noisy substandard airport? Treating passengers like rubbish.,1
"The last leg of my connection was Chandigarh to Dubai. I was sat in 4D aisle. Through more than 2 hours of the journey my seat was being kicked and punched from seat 5D just behind me by a child. I complained twice and nothing happened. I asked to see the cabin supervisor and was told she was busy eating. I explained the situation to another crew member and they cautioned the Pax on seat 5D (the mother of the child) to be more decent. Finally after the third call, the family themselves moved the child to seat 4B the middle seat on the other side. At this phase of flight the captain had flashed the fasten seat belt as there was turbulence. To my shock the father of the child sat on 5C made the child stand up on the tray table of seat 4b and play with the overhead fittings including the light, the call button, the oxygen mask compartment and others. I am astonished that such risky and terrible behaviour from the parents of the child was tolerated by the crew and also that the leading lady as they are called simply refused to attend the issue. I am calling to accountability the cabin supervisor and asking Indigo to prevent the tray table from bring used as a play area. Indigo crew looks poorly trained on safety.",1
Sydney to Auckland. Terrible experience from beginning to end. The flight was cancelled while we were in the line to check in. We were offered an alternative flight with Qantas however it was 7 hours later and we had commitments back in New Zealand so asked if we could arrange a refund as we would have to purchase flights on another airline. The customer service manager agreed and said she'd make notes in their system regarding the details. We purchased last minute flights on an alternative airline at horrendous expense being last minute and flew home. When I went to follow up the refund I was bounced around no less that five different people and pushed to online chats no-one being able to assist and all saying that we had boarded the plane and taken the flight. No 'notes' were ever put in the system and they had to launch an 'investigation'. Two weeks later they send me an email saying that as per their terms here was a voucher to the value of the flight. I replied saying that the Customer Service manager had agreed to refund the flight given the circumstances and received no reply. I re-sent the email a week later and also received no reply. Every aspect of the dealing was absolutely horrendous and took a lot of self focus to breath through it and not react in an angry fashion. At least writing this review has given a means to express my dissatisfaction and let it go.,0
Kuantan to Singapore. Very bad customer service.  Just don't care the customers even they can help us to check in before 45mins departure. Many of us cannot check in and missed the flight and our flight ticket just waste for nothing.,1
"Manila to Dubai. I have been traveling a lot lately and this is the worst airline I have ever used. I didn't have a pre-ordered meal, but I was planning to purchase in the flight some food. The stewardess told me that the Credit card system is down and I only have to pay in US $ or PHP. I didn't have both of these and it was a 9 hrs flight plus 1.5 hrs of delay on the ground. I told her to check if I can pay in UAE Dirhams since we are going to Dubai but she refused with a fake smile and not willing to help. I asked her to check again coz 9 hrs without drinking or eating would be too much but she was not willing much to help and just said No and left me. This stewardess was on flight 5J 014 from Manila to Dubai on the 6th Jan 19 at 4:10 PM. I can understand a cheap ticket flight comes with uncomfortable seats, no flight entertainment at all and not good food and beverages but people treatment is above all. This is definitely my last time to use Cebu Pacific. Another stewardess, agreed to bring me 2 cups of purified water after telling her that I will be hydrated for this 9 hrs flight and it is not my problem that the system is down.",1
"Flight left only 40 mins late - on time by Lion's standards. It was the usual no-frills flight with no food, drinks or enterntainment, except for one annoyance. Despite checking in early, I was given a seat in the very last row right by the toilet which was stinking of urine as many passengers didn't know how to flush it! On the first leg stewardess kindly offered that I could move elsewhere, but on the 2nd leg from Makassar they insisted the plane was full and I had to stay there, when in fact later I found entire rows of seats empty at the front.",1
"To start with, we were travelling to Male, Maldives from Cochin using Indigo, we had booked our flight from Cochin to the Maldives and then onwards to Bahrain. The check in counter staff member reacted very differently to us trying to travel telling us we are supposed to book a return flight back to India from the Maldives as per air bubble agreement, since we didnt have time to review the reasons mentioned by the airline, we had no choice but to book a return flight to India. This was not enough for the airline, they wanted a direct flight back. We again made our travel agent rebook, while we didn't cancel our flight to Bahrain, since we didn't trust the totally misinformed Indigo staff, we travelled, spent days in the Maldives and travelled to Bahrain without any hassles! We checked and rechecked with Male airport as well, no such rule was there! Wrong information besides being totally un cooperative towards customers, we are very disappointed with the airline, especially as I have never experienced this. We had asked to meet with the manager, instead of asking him to come to talk to us, we were sent to some counter where he was seated fidgeting with his phone, laid back and totally uncooperative. I am not a person who likes writing such reviews but such incidents are very very problematic. Hope Indigo take appropriate action.",1
Upon taking advantage of the 'special' deals that Jetstar advertise through the media I was disappointed to find that there were extra charges for seat baggage and absolute robbery of credit card fees. Upon checking in my baggage was one kilo over the 15 kgs I paid for upon checking in and I got fined $60 for the fault. The line for getting onto the plane was absolutely terrible with only one staff member taking the ticket stubs it took over 25 mins to get onto the plane.,1
Paid for allocated seats to Phuket at the cost of $150 received confirmation of these seats on boarding they just shrugged their shoulders and said the seats are already occupied. Not good enough spoke to customer service on our return and can not refund this is most unacceptable they have taken $150 from us and we did not receive what we paid for other then this service was good.,0
"Received an email notifying my inbound flight cancelled, offered following day flight which was not possible due to hotel bookings and appointments made, so I need to book another flight from another airline. Tried to get refund from AirAsia, discovered no other options except to use it's AVA robotic chat, which was not really user-friendly, and persistently keeps pushing credit rather then cash refund, I persisted, finally left on queue for agent chat, waited approx 45mins, suddenly AVA says not available, call back later! Called back later, waited another 1hr15mins, agent came on, says AA don't give cash refund even if AA cancels flights and copy pasted bits of their t&C's all over chat with link. I followed link to AA's full t&C's, which gave three options when flights are cancelled, and option C clearly stated; full refund to the bank account. So I pointed this out to agent, and copy pasted that paragraph in chat for her perusal. Agent replied; doesn't apply to domestic flights. I asked her to please show me where that is stated as I can't see it mentioned. Agent rudely left chat. I've always used AirAsia prior to this incident but now, I must say I find AirAsia unprofessional unethical business acumen is deplorable, and the unnecessarily rude attitude and rather childish mannerism of its agent totally unwarranted and uncalled for.",1
"Queenstown to Hobart via Melbourne. I'm writing this after experiencing some of the most horrific, embarrassing, despicable customer service I've  encountered. My initial itinerary had me flying to Melbourne to meet friends, then transferring to Tasmania for my final destination. Jetstar canceled my Queenstown to Melbourne flight because of engineering problems in the plane. I then waited in the airport for 4 hours to be booked on a new flight. The Jetstar service agent gave me two options, and said I could proceed with both, and just needed to select one option by midnight. I could book a new flight on Air New Zealand to Melbourne, get reimbursed for the Jetstar flight to Melbourne and at the same time get a reservation on a flight through Brisbane on Jetstar. She said I could tentatively keep both options open so long as I informed Jetstar which I'd like to select by midnight. The attendants assured  me I would be fully reimbursed for my travel if I booked on an Air New Zealand flight. I got home, decided I'd like to fly with Air New Zealand and cancel the convoluted trip through Brisbane (where I'd have to book last minute accommodations during the holidays which is expensive, challenging, and unnecessary). I called the agents, who informed me they had canceled my flight, and that they could not reimburse me or change it back. They explained the reason was because the airport staff failed to make a note on my booking about the agreement they offered me, that I had an option for a refund. After explaining the situation numerous times, I was told I had no alternative, no option for a refund, and stuck with the travel to Brisbane, even though this would mean out of pocket expenses of several hundred dollars with no reimbursement, along with entirely missing my entire Melbourne experience. This is absurd and some of the most terrible customer service I have ever encountered in my life.",1
"Bangkok to Manila in November 2019. As this is a low-cost airline the service is 'no-frills'. Nevertheless, the ground service is good - not the best - but I suggest more check-in counters. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. While this may not be the same on other flights - they are improving on their on-time performance. Cost for money is good - considering I only paid half of what I would usually pay if I chose a full-service carrier for this route. The legroom was a little bit crampy, but you get what you paid for. This A330 operated by Cebu Pacific is infamous for its cramped seating configuration. I wouldn't recommend this for a long-haul flight, but for short flights its okay. You get to your destination on the cheapest price while the product quality is still there.",0
"Hobart to Melbourne Tullamarine. Second time flying with Jetstar and they impressed me. One thing worth mentioning about Hobart airport is that when we were boarding, it was raining. And the airport was kind enough to provide us with umbrellas when walking across the tarmac (No boarding bridges at Hobart airport) Once boarded, it was refreshing to see the new Jetstar interior, especially the brand-new seats. They were thinner than other  seats, which enabled a greatly increased amount of leg room. They shifted the seat pocket to above the tray table, thus increasing the leg room. The cabin crew was nice with positive attitudes towards passengers. My only complaint would be the inadequate amount of lavatories onboard (only one in the front and two in the rear) compared to five in some airlines' A321s, but it's a budget airline, and it's not too bad for a 55-minute flight. The flight was delayed due to bad weather, but the captain was very prompt to provide updates. Overall a fairly nice experience at this price point and I would recommend it to the people who are looking to save a few bucks on your plane ticket. (The inflight entertainment was just a magazine btw).",0
"Worst customer service ever. I am writing this on behalf of my dad who was meant to fly from Perth to Melbourne this morning 8am to get to Melbourne in time for a meeting tonight at 6pm. However the flight got cancelled and apparently the only flight available to rebook him on isnt until 3:15pm this afternoon with Qantas, meaning he will miss his meeting. This only flight available however is a load of lies as there was another Qantas flight available at 9:15 plus multiple virgin flights but apparently its impossible to book onto these flights. So I suggested how about I personally book him onto one of these flights, because For some reason they cant do that, and they pay the difference in price but no, they cant do that either.  I get that its a budget airline but at the very least you would expect them to put them to rebook passengers on time appropriate flights when they are the reason passengers cant catch their original flights.  Absolutely appalling service by people who despite being a budget airline do not care about the little people, only the weight of what is in their pocket.",1
"Denpasar to Perth. The flight left on time and the aircraft had recently been refurbished as the seats were clean and everything had a new feel. As JetStar is a low cost carrier, you must buy food and drinks on board (it should be noted that no drinks bought in the airport can be brought onboard the Perth flight as they search you again at the gate). The selection was very good but the prices were quite high for what it was so Id recommend getting snacks before you get onboard. Crew werent overly friendly and seemed quite rushed. The seats only have a pitch of 29 inches which was just adequate for someone over 6 feet tall. I think that on a flight over 3:30 would become uncomfortable in the confined space. The flight landed about 25 minutes late and it took forever to get off the plane. For a low cost airline it was fairly average and next time Id choose other carriers on this route.",1
"My previous flight was not pleasant. I had to hold my pasta and water the entire flight because the fold-out table was broken. Fast forward to 2023, I was supposed to fly to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam but as usual, they canceled my flight without any reason. On the next day, they moved my flight to a late-night one saying that they are trying to fill that one. I did not accept the changes simply because I am a solo female traveler. I opted for their refund, and to my surprise, my 13k flight is down to 9,500php. What type of sorcery is it? I reached out to their chat support because they don't have an outline number, and the agents (4 agents told me that the processing fee is non-refundable). They told me just to accept that late-night flight, the agent was unresponsive and lazy. By the way, there's no assurance that I will be able to get my refund within 2 months. Just like what they did during the pandemic. The long refund process is their way of telling you to place another booking because your money is now ours.",1
"Auckland to Melbourne. I'd like to congratulate Jetstar on their fabulous customer service! My flight was delayed for 9 hours (the Captain was unexpectedly sick), and I was given $40 worth of food vouchers, put up in a four-star hotel with shuttles and provided another $30 for a dinner at the restaurant. The poor Jetstar staff copped a lot of flack. Jetstar always gets kicked when something goes wrong, but this is my first delayed flight with them (out of about 20) and Air NZ have delayed flights I've been on a few times. Plus they're always cheaper.",0
"Hobart to Melbourne. A smooth and straight-forward flight which operated on time. The seats had slightly more legroom than those on a Virgin Boeing 737. The only gripe was that three of the four check-in machines in Hobart were not working, and there was only one bag-drop counter in operation. In Melbourne T4 our bags were on the carousel when we got there.",0
SIN-SGN on new 737-900ER. Flight wasn't full. Small snack box with a bun and cake provided plus a drink. After clearing stewardess no where to be seen. Little regards to safety with mobile phones ringing in mid flight. Flight departed on time and arrived with minimal fuss. Good thing is it departs from Terminal 1 in Singapore.,1
"Singapore to Kuching. It was the best bow cost carrier I have flown with. Earlier, I have had many experiences with airlines like Wizzair, Ryanair or Norwegian, and Airasia is in my opinion the best LCC airline. Friendly staff. I would recommend this airline for short flights.",0
"Sydney to Ballina. I really dont recommend this airline company. Ive traveled a lot in my life but it is by far the worst airline company I have ever fly with. Crew isnt nice, being charged 60 dollars for 2kgs more. First company ever doing that. The ratio quality/price is not worth it at all. Definitely wont fly with that airline ever again.",1
"SIN-MEL Star Class (Business). Really disappointing; crew chatted loudly on this overnight flight. I went and spoke to them as they'd woken my son - ignored me and went back to joking and laughing loudly. Breakfast not offered and 90 minutes from MEL was ""too close"" for them to offer even coffee! No eye contact from crew upon boarding or leaving the aircraft. The most personally disconnected flight I've ever taken. The entirely foreign crew may have culturally contributed to this.",1
Flew Cebu - Clark return flight check in was proficient and flight left on time. In flight service was good with provision of snacks and drinks for sale at reasonable prices. Staff were friendly and made flight enjoyable.,0
"Have not be able to register luggage due to downtime of their website. Has taken some weeks to register because of lacking password-updates and similar faults. Wrote e-mail to customer service to change to a later flight and add luggage, since web-site does not work - no answer in over 24 hours. Travel-date is 48 hours after my request, so I have purchased tickets with another airline. In KL there is full immigration, security check and customs at arrival and the same extensive checks on departure - so transit is a few hours hard work. I am 1.80 cm, too much for the allotted space. If you sit at the window, it is difficult to get in contact with the personnel.",1
Our very first experience with AirAsia and we are totally pleased. Our family of 8 flew from Johor Bahru - KL so a quick flight. Check-in was smooth however we arrived early and it was quite sometime before the check-in counter opened. The waiting area at Johor Bahru is just adequate. However the flight itself was smooth and efficient getting us to KL on time. As it was such a quick flight there was no time for inflight entertainment or food & beverages. I would highly recommend AirAsia. Value for money was excellent.,0
Gold Coast to Singapore return early May. Left on time both directions. Got yellow seats for extra space and it was worth it for additional leg room. Can't complain at all. Service was good and efficient. Meals are ok not perfect but adequate. Check in both ways was efficient and friendly without long lines even the plane was full both ways. Paid extra 5 dollars at Singapore for early check in and spent nice time at Singapore airport which is amazing! Luggage arrived safely too. Great service and price - will use again!,0
Very uncomfortable seats hard narrow and without proper neck support as you find on Jetstar. Though the pitch is okay the placement of the seat supports meant that I felt cramped at the window seat. I emerged off my flights feeling stiff and sore. I missed the moving map as there are no cabin screens. Issues with inadvertent pressing of call buttons mean that they are often ignored by staff even when required. Attendants seemed helpful but difficult to hear and understand over the cabin noise. No online check in and lack of early check at the desk is inconvenient when departing from Changi to Sydney at 2 am as you can't use all Changi's wonderful airside facilities. Much preferred Jetstar.,1
"Extremely slow counter service, flight was supposed to take off at 2pm, but people still stuck at the check-in counter. For some reason people could bring in multiple carry-on luggages and were allowed to use other seats' overhead compartments, causing massive delays as flight crew had to re-stow luggage into cargo for other passengers who rightfully had the compartments for their own use. Did the counter crew not check boarding passengers and allowed one person to bring in not only 2 suitcases but also multiple bags? We had a Karen who not only used one full compartment for her 4 bags of souvenirs, but still had the gall to demand crew to leave her suitcases with her when they were trying to stow them into cargo. Cabin crew is trying their best, but people are extremely inconsiderate so maybe have more stringent checks. It has been almost 25 minutes delay now due to counter checking incompetence and flight has still not hit the runway. Do not recommend.",1
JQ 27 12 Jan. Very bad experience. Never again. Travelled with Jetstar to Phuket because they flew direct. They were not cheaper than other airlines available at the time just the flight times were good. Everything on this flight came with an extra cost. Food drinks entertainment and even a blanket for our daughter who was feeling cold came at an additional cost. I think Jetstar have poor service and are a rip off. I will not fly again or recommend this airline to others.,1
"Indigo staff Chirag at the Goa airport saved my day. I was late to board the Goa to Mumbai indigo flight due to a road accident on 2nd October 2021 flight 6E 259 @ 19.50 The boarding gate was closed and I had a connecting flight to London. The lady at the checkin desk was really helpful, she first refused but later checked with Chirag and than it was run run run - he guided me to the boarding gate. Made my London flight on time Cant thank him the the check in desk staff enough. Saved me from panic attack. In the last 10 days I have travelled at least 5 times with the Indigo. Excellent service from checking to departure. And the best thing is its always on time. Keep up the good work",0
"Manila to Cebu. Probably the worst flight company. We've booked 4 flights with Cebu, one was cancelled 2 weeks before the departure date (it was a connection flight) and the other 3 have been delayed (1h to 2h30). We have lost a connection flight. No one assumes responsibility they just told us that ""planes are delayed all the time"".",1
MNL-TPE v.v. Check-in was fast at NAIA however small confusion that the monitor is showing a wrong counter for the flight and were directed by the ground staff to the other side. Flight left on time on both sectors clean cabin but with a broken tray table legroom is restricted and uncomfortable for a red-eye flight since most PAX reclining their seatbacks so it was hard to move. FAs were mixture of smiling and cheerful ladies down to bored but still polite crew and I like that they were proactive in turning on/off the reading lights for the PAX. Buy-on-board choices are good and I think were in the right price too. Overall it was a good value for the money especially for short flights and I would recommend it to those travellers who are on a budget.,0
"Denpasar to Berlin via Singapore. Staff and flight wise everything was great. However my flight from Singapore to Berlin was nearly an hour late - leading me to miss a connecting flight on another airline. Scoot showed no accountability for this and offered nothing in the way of compensation to what ended up being a costly error for me. I wish I could say my flights were cheap enough to offset the cost, but they weren't that dissimilar to that of higher rated airlines - I just assumed with it being a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines that the quality of the flight would be reduced, but you'd end up with the same customer service - apparently I was mistaken. I won't be flying with Scoot again as their customer support in the event of a mistake is terrible. I would only ever consider flying with Scoot if it was direct.",1
Singapore to Kota Kinabalu. Bad counter staff attitude on seating. Boarding pass error and staff was unwilling to assist. System error on web check in. Feedback casually sweeped under.,1
"I bought this Denpasar to Jakarta flight about 8 days before and it only cost me roughly AU$50 which I though was great as it saved me about AU$300 on flying back to London. I was expecting to have a horrible flight but it was very comfortable. The staff were nice enough and my only complaint would be the half hour delay which was not announced or displayed at the airport, it would have been nice to be given an estimate of the delay but nevertheless the flight arrived at Jakarta on time.",0
"Was told my flight is canceled. I had to book a new one and was told I can request a refund. Did exactly this. Then I was told its actually not canceled. I already made a lot of extra costs (Extra hotel nights, and new booking). They were happy to announce it was not canceled. I explained them they told me its canceled. I shown proof. They didnt care. So I booked double. And they do not bother to refund or anything. Horrible service and attitude!",1
"Flew from Manila to Iloilo. I am giving Cebu Pacific a 10 this time. Online booking was smooth, online check in was ok, ground crew were friendly and proactive in offering the loyalty membership. Cabin crew were friendly and surprisingly both MNL-Iloilo and Iloilo-MNL, minimal delays only. Great job keep it up.",0
I have used Jetstar twice in the last year. Once from Melb to Bris and a few days ago Melb to Hobart. I find the flight staff to be extremely friendly and helpful with all aspects of flying. On the way to Hobart we had a very friendly air hostess and when she learnt it was my youngest boy's first time on a plane she said she may have a surprise for them and she left for a few minutes and upon her return explained we could go into the cockpit and meet the pilots and let the boys have a look around when we touch down. So friendly and the boys loved seeing inside the pilots world. Being a person who fears flying both trips were smooth and hassle free. I'm not a small lady but I found the seats comfy enough. No frills but all you need for short flights.,0
D7206 24 October 2014. This was our first Business Class flight experience with Air Asia and it exceeded all our expectations. Because it is a No Frills Airline we were not expecting a full service. We made our meal selection at the time of booking. We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment. The seats however are as good as you would hope to find in any full service business class. Fully lie flat and with the full size pillow and duvet supplied we enjoyed a good sleep for almost the entire flight. Would I chose this again? Absolutely!,0
"Honolulu to Osaka. Terrible airplane that didnt have WiFi or movie services working. Flight attendants rude and didnt speak English very well. Have to pay for everything from water to food and its overpriced like you cant believe. $20 for a frozen meal. Upon follow up and trying to contact customer service, my case was closed 2 times before I could really discuss my issues. Basically got hung up on via email. They dont care about your experience so go to someone who does.",1
I never thought I would write a good review about Jetstar. But here goes. Flew Melbourne Hawaii return in Business class. Impressed with the produce for the price that you pay. Both flights bang on time. Staff were super friendly on the way over and friendly on the way back. Food out of MEL was great. Very impressed. 9 out of 10. Not so out of Hawaii. 6 out 10. We had one of the new A330 with the in seat video which was great going to Hawaii. Plane was in great condition. Coming home we had one of the older ones and boy do you notice. Though the seats were very comfortable but juggling the video and a meal was too hard. Its one or the other. So overall happy with the international service of Jetstar. Now if that could filter down to its domestic product.,0
"Sydney to Cairns. At the gate they weighed my carry on and made me pay $60 to check it in or forfeit my flight. I also had to change flights (the next day, weeks in advance) and they charged me full rate but gave me a $50 voucher which they wouldn't accept towards the $60 fee. Jetstar will continually find ways to squeeze 10-20% extra in every possible way.",1
The service was good compared to other value airlines. The food served was enough and I was contented. I really think that the airline was indeed perfect and more preferable to me.,1
"Bali to Sydney. Got told an hour before that flight was cancelled. Offered no help when managing booking via phone or online. Got to the airport, crowds of people standing around, unsure of what to do because there wasnt any staff to assist. Very stressful and upsetting. Would rather assurance over cheap flights.",1
"Denpasar to Auckland via Melbourne. We left Denpasar airport a bit late due to several excuses, the main excuse was paperwork. We have already boarded the aircraft and waited on the ground for about an hour which made us miss our connecting flight to Auckland. Ground staff was a bit slow on giving us information about what was going on which made some of us very stressed and uncomfortable. The connecting flight that we were meant to be on had already left at 11.05pm when we arrived at 12am. Jetstar gave us accommodation and told us that we were on the next flight out which was at 9.10am but due to the immigration not giving us Indonesians visas we were unable to go to the hotel which meant we had to make ourselves comfortable in the transit area (which weirdly you had to call someone to open the door for you, it is so impractical when you are in a rush). We were given food vouchers worth $20 each (no shops were open at that time so we were starving). We were going to get our boarding tickets at the gate and the ground service were very aggressive and so unfriendly and rude which put us off so much. Overall, the cabin staff were alright but I've seen happier more friendlier cabin staff on other airlines. I recommend that Jetstar should really get their services to prioritise customers that have had disrupted flights and also train their staff to be more friendly and not so rude and aggressive. It would have made it more pleasant if the ground staff were more helpful and informative. Also on the flight from Auckland to Denpasar via Melbourne, our baggage had been left in Melbourne for around 3/4 days. Our baggage was meant to be checked in all the way through to Denpasar but obviously did this not happen. Not sure who to blame, Melbourne airport or Jetstar but this is really not a good way to start a holiday. We had to leave for Surabaya on the very next day we arrived in Denpasar which meant we had to drive 3 hours to the airport to claim our bags. We were stranded without clothes for 5 days.",1
"The airline is still processing a refund after 5 months. If you are lucky not to have your flight rescheduled and other issues, then you may be one of the few lucky ones. I am still waiting for my refund Air Asia!",1
"My aunt (89) was booked to take this domestic flight from Auckland to Nelson, but was late to the check-in counter. Instead of refusing to assist, Jetstar organised an airport hotel, transport to/from, meal voucher, and booked her on the following morning's flight. This went several extra miles beyond what they were required to do, and was much appreciated by our family. Also pleased to see Jetstar in NZ has finally agreed to switch from opt-out to opt-in for extras such as baggage etc on their flights, starting in May 2016.",0
Didn't like this flight or airline. The airline had no blankets and the plane was cold. They didn't even have any to buy from them. The seats don't recline at all so forgot using a neck pillow. Couldn't change my ore ordered food. The options are shocking anyways so we turned ours down at 4am. Would try to avoid using them in the future.,1
Sydney to Gold Coast. Poor customer service. Had a funeral the next day and they cancelled my flight and wouldn't find a replacement flight or pay for the difference between a different flight. They are the worse humans with no heart. I'd rather drive 12 hours up there than fly with Jetstar.,1
After 8 hrs waiting in airport flight was cancelled with no attempt to assist and no point in flying on the available replacement flight. This has become a regular occurrence. No reimbursement available for lost accommodation and no ability to cancel return flight on line. 300 people trying to be processed at a single service desk and no sense of remorse or care. 8 dollar voucher offered while waiting which doesn't pay for water. Would not trust them again but unfortunately have another more expensive holiday booked with them. Cross my fingers.,1
"Singapore to Bangkok. We scoot regularly and had been since Scoot started its service. Scoot was very good initially but changed from being good to bad and now worse. Over the past two years we had our flights rescheduled occasionally but recently all three of our bookings, Feb, Apr and May, flights have been rescheduled delayed by a few hours causing us a lot of inconvenience. Their Call centre was not interested in assisting, the lady who attended me was very rude and loud, instead of trying to help and understand the frustration and inconvenience they have caused their customers, she arrogantly told me Scoot have every right in the fine print conditions to reschedule their flights and any request for change of flight would incurred cost. Perhaps Scoot needs to remember there are other budget airlines and they are providing better services. The good reputation they painstakingly built is now being tarnished by the present appalling services. We will never Scoot again.",1
"I am 78 and my wife 68. We planned this trip to visit our daughter staying in UAE. Did'nt expect the experience will be so bad. This flight 6E 1407 on the 23rd April 2022 was supposed to fly from Lucknow India at 21:30 as per schedule. We were asked to board the flight. And then the wait started, at first they said some technical error we should be go to fly soon. But then it was delayed by almost four hours. People where seated in the aircraft with no air condition / no water to drink. The air hostess were helpless. The main reason for the delay was because the pilot who was supposed to fly this aircraft didn't turn up for some reason. So the airline decided to make us wait in the aircraft under these conditions ... is this acceptable? Indigo has been a good experience for me early. This was one experience that I faced recently.",1
Having flown Air Asia X and the domestic service on numerous occasions I have only experienced one glitch. On a return flight from Kuching to KUL the incoming flight to Kuching was almost 3.5 hours late. No explanation was offered. As a consequence I failed to catch a connecting flight from KL to Penang. The counter staff at LCCT were helpful and reissued my ticket. The only problem was that this was the last flight to Penang that evening. It was a very long day! Providing you leave 3 to 4 hours leeway if you have another flight booked generally AA are pretty good. It is really a question of value for money and AA are exceptional in this respect.,0
Terrible experience with customer service on this airline. Given it is required to get a visa to travel to Japan and you have to be part of an organized tour we were denied access due to lack of availability on booked tours. Totally out of our control and infringed on honeymoon plans to Japan. ZIPAIR refused any form of change or refund and despite several calls and emails have left us with nothing. The worst airline experience ever from two people who fly a lot. We booked business class and are out thousands of dollars. Avoid at all cost.,1
"I waited in the check in line for 3 hours because it was under staffed, after my flights was rescheduled and had to ring Jetstar a number of times to sort it out. Now my flight has been pushed back a day later when I have wedding to attend.",1
"Give Scoot the Boot - travelled on flight TZ2 - Singapore to Sydney, night flight. The seating layout is not Business Class - more like a bad Premium Economy on any other airline. No leg room when seat in front is pushed back. No blanket, no pillow (this was a night flight). Flight crew had no smiles or personality and barely spoke English. It was a quick flight due to the new Boeing 787 - just 7 hours all up - thank goodness as we could not wait to get off the plane and stretch our legs. Even though the Food was pre-ordered on booking, nothing was served until 3 hours out of Sydney. If you wanted food before then, you had to pay extra for it - drinks too. When food did appear it was terrible quality. The coffee was instant, with powered milk in a polystyrene cup! and last but not least - NO Inflight Entertainment or WIFI connectivity !! Yes - Scoot is the budget arm of Singapore Airlines but, how budget does 'budget Scoot business class' have to get.",1
This is the second incident where I had to give up my cabin bag at boarding. While flying from Mumbai theres never been space. We reach boarding just for them to take my cabin luggage away and let many other rude passengers get away. And while exiting I realise that passengers sitting in seats 11/12 have placed their luggage above 14 which the cabin crew doesnt manage.,1
SIN-CGK-MDC. Flights on time. Brand new planes nice looking interior. They accept US issued credit cards unlike other carriers. 20 kg of luggage is included in the price of ticket.,0
"Vishakapatnam to Delhi via Hyderabad.  An earlier direct flight finished boarding and was not full. They wouldn't let us on that flight despite having sufficient space for absolutely no reason. A systems or customer service problem I'm not sure. But a plane just took off that we could have been in, and now we get to sit in airplanes for an absolutely needless 5 more hours. Awesome.",1
Jetstar cancelled my flight 3 hours before schedule. My flight was morning flight so I was booked a taxi in the early morning. So disappointed.,1
Our flight was delayed over an hour going to Kuala Lumpur and over 40 hours going back to Manila! Cebu Pacific didn't even bother to book us for an overnight stay at a hotel. We also had to demand for every meal voucher that we were provided. In the plane they ran out of hot meals (instant cup noodles) and chips. Prior seat selections we had paid for were not honoured either. To top it all when we got back to Manila our luggage was missing!,1
The flight attendance were doing their best but the flight comfort itself was an absolute joke. The renting of the blankets for 2 euro or haggling over which food everyone got. Having to show boarding passes again and again to prove what you bought or didn't buy made the whole experience feel so cheap and badly put together. I don't think anyone was happy after that flight. 10 hrs flights with no entertainment is another invention I didn't think I'll experience. The flight itself wasn't even that cheap so I'm wondering why not charge 15 euro extra and give everyone all service they should get on such a long flight... the food prices were not even that expensive so I'm just sitting here n wondering why would anyone choose this uncomfortable situation for both the employees and all customers. I will not soon forget the flight attendant lady raising her voice at an older gentleman customer to tell him he can not change his order of food... it was bad. I didn't know before booking but will surely never book again. Might be ok for a short flight of 2 hrs or so but for long haul it left me with the worst taste in my mouth.,1
"Sydney to Auckland on June 17th. Checked-in was convenient and fast in the counter. My Seat was 10D. The space of the seat was narrow,so my knees had to touch the front seat. I felt uncomfortable. The service of cabin crew was just at the standard level. But this flight was value for the price.",0
"Booked the flight Manila to Caticlan October 2015 with Cebu Pacific. Expected departure on 18/01/2016 0005. On 17/01/2016 at 2342 received notification of a cancellation due to maintenance of the aircraft, without offering any alternative arrangements. Told to contact customer service or go to their airport office. The customer service agent was absolutely indifferent to the inconvenience caused by the cancellation and the proposed rebooking on another flight from Manila to Kalibo, about 80km from Caticlan. At check in there was a line of about 40 passengers - staff were efficient but not polite. Boarding slow and laborious and delayed departure by about 30-minutes. Onboard, narrow seats and with very little space for the legs if you are taller than 180cm.",1
I am grateful to IndiGo for making my journey so comfortable and smooth. I traveled with IndiGo from Patna to Pune via Delhi. I had a pleasant flight experience and I'd like to commend staff on an exceptional level of service.  The staffs that we encountered were extremely polite.  Thanks to porters for being a great help and carrying my hand baggage. I'd like to mention staff who came with chocolates and biscuits and offered it to all kids as it was children's day! It was a very sweet gesture on part of IndiGo to come up with such ideas. Keep up the good work.,0
Flew JQ269 AKL-WLG 15 Nov 2013 returned JQ268 WLG-AKL 17 Nov 2013. Cost was $120 return for 2 incl credit card charge. Both flights on time or a little early crew good and efficient plane (A320) clean. In Aus JQ may be hard work but in NZ they seem fine but you must check in on time and be at the gate in plenty of time. We pushed back 10 mins before due time from AKL and from WLG 5 mins ahead of time. I've no issues with them locally and they give Air NZ much needed competition. Compare the rates on the main trunk (AKL-WLG-CHC-ZQN/DUD with provincial eg ROT-CHC that doesn't have competition. Food and beverages and IFE are both extras. We didn't use either but it looked ok. In summary the perfect bus ride on time safe clean and cheap.,0
"Flew Jetstar Airways from Newcastle to Brisbane. Terrible, first flight was delayed 4 hours and they did not contact or notify us at all. Then the return flight was cancelled and again no contact at all. Luckily we thought to ring and check. If I could rate this lower, I would. Never again!",1
I was not well and asked for water 4 times even when the staff was serving i asked for water. They were only concentrating on people who had ordered for food! After paying so much money to these airline companies with hefty amount of service taxes this is the kind of service we get? in a 2 hrs flight i kept asking for water by pressing the service button twice but I was not entertained.,1
"Jetstar Airways flight from Sydney to Melbourne cancelled before the incoming had arrived (courtesy of FlightTracker24) but fifteen minutes anyway. Reason given is ""scheduled engineering"", if this airline pretends that when they would logically have known weeks in advance is 1) lying 2) incomptent 3) assuming their passengers are incompetent, or 4) all of the above. Rebooked to flight following 60 minutes later. Okay. Board. Sit. Wait. Bored. Over the next two hours there are no fewer than 7 announcements from The Deck explaining how it'll be ""five or ten more minutes"". I'm going with a comination of 2) and 3) above.",1
"Flight got cancelled, no refund but only voucher. Asked to use same amount for luggage allowance, not permitted. Had in total 8 flights within last 20 days with same luggages via different airlines and only cebu pacific asked for extra payment. Was ok to pay and during return flight I was told to pay for all my hand carries although we had exactly same amount of luggages with same kg that we had at the time of arrival. No one knows what the standard is and doing their own thing. Never again, worst airline ever.",1
"6E189 6th June. Low budget Airline - their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. On time is a good thing - their flights are often now delayed or run late. Check-in process - everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. Two days back on 4th June I did Web Check in for my 6th June flight using my smartphone. While I was successful in doing web check-in in spite of me giving the email address and phone no I did not get a copy of the boarding pass - beating the while process of doing Web check-in. At Delhi T1 terminal when I tried to print my boarding pass at the Check in Kiosk while it displayed the Boarding Pass I did not get my print out! On taking it up with the ground staff I got a casual reply - please stand in the queue even though I mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. As a result I reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented ""Sir you are very late please be on time next time""! I have booked 3 tickets for my family through on-line booking system. After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking. But to my surprise and disappointment I found seats were allotted together that included an aisle and window seat along with the middle seat. When I tried to change the seats it did not allow me and charged me Rs 400 extra (Rs 200 each for Window and Aisle 'premium' seats) over and above the fare and there was no way I could change it.",1
Flew Melbourne-Osaka KIX via Cairns and Tokyo Narita-Melbourne. Flight over was on a 787 which was nice and new. Return flight on an older A330. Seats reasonably comfortable on both flights. Both flights on time. Service is basically non-existent. Crew seem so disorganised. Not sure what they do for the majority of the flight as you do not see them. If Jetstar are much cheaper fly with them but all in all even considering they are a low cost carrier flying with them is a nothing experience.,1
"Cabin crew & airport staff all do their best. We had a great captain & turbulence today. I enjoyed the flight. But Jetstar the airline is awful, it's like some ""Freemium"" game. Next, the seat belt will be $10. Today, Jetstar herded people to stand at the gate at Gold Coast - before the A320 had even disembarked it's last load! Jetstar made 120 people, many elderly, stand for 20mins in a queue to nowhere, just for Jetstar's convenience. My tip: wait until the line is already getting short, rather than standing in the 'maze' for no reason. Also check your fare rules. I find 'Plus' the best/least worst.",1
Our family of 18 adults and children were supposed to return to Manila on the last afternoon flight from Coron in early April. As expected the flight got delayed a few times until it was announced that it was cancelled. Someone told us that usually if late afternoon flights are delayed chances are they get cancelled as Coron's airport does not have runway lights at night. We got shuttled to a hotel in the town proper and we were given 4 rooms which we refused as there were at least 5 families. We negotiated to be transferred to another (better) hotel which fortunately had the required 5 rooms. While this was a harrowing experience for us we were fortunate that their staff listened and attended to our needs. Cancelled flights are a big inconvenience esp when you are travelling with small children. We probably will never fly Cebu Pacific anymore.,1
"Bali to Perth with AirAsia Indonesia. It was my first time flying on AirAsia. Unfortunately I did not have a great experience. This is because throughout the entire flight two little kids kept grabbing the top of my seat like little monkeys. When they weren't dangling from my seat or my boyfriends seat they were kicking our seats, for 4+hours. The odd thing was that these kids did not seem to have a seat of their own, and were either sitting on their parents lap or torturing my boyfriend and I. I don't know that I can fault the airline for this, as we never voiced to the flight attendent what was going on. On a side note, I thought the airline provided plenty of decent looking food and beverage options.",1
"Melbourne to Gold Coast. They charge the most outrageous amount for a carry-on handbag when you have to pay the bag charge at the gate, 60 dollar for a few kilos. You have to be extremely alert on the weight of your carry-on bag. They advertise with low fares but if you add all the baggage charges and the extra charges at the gate when you have made a mistake with your carry-on bag they are not at all cheap, but quite expensive, this is it how a low cost airline should be, they misuse the rules of baggage weight as they know that people can make mistakes with their baggage weight and the overcharge you without having any options to correct this online. Never again flying with them.",1
DEL-PNQ. Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant. The only negative point would be air hostesses being less interactive and involved.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Before I got into the gate, Airasia wasn't that strict with the baggage 7kg rule check, which is good. Boarding was quite efficient. It was quick and departed according to the time and staff were friendly and helpful.",0
Last night I received an email saying my flight from GC to Singapore at 9am had been delayed until 2pm. Arrive at check in desk only to be told that it has now been delayed until 6pm and that that's not a guaranteed time. Never mind the 2 onward flights I'm going to have to miss and non refundable accommodation on top - what I want to know is why were customers not emailed on the additional delay? The opportunity to arrange not sitting in this airport would have been welcomed. You forget that many of your flyers are from Brisbane - we can't exactly hop in a cab and go back home. Up until this point I've had a relatively good experience with this airline.,1
"Taipei to Tokyo. Scoot nickles and dimes you, constantly makes you painfully aware you chose economy. They charge you $4 for a bottle of water, Taipei does not have free water and an hour long security/out immigration before which you have to empty bottles. They will separate families in different rows. They won't let me use last two seats in aft of the plane saying there is a S$20 fee each for them. The checkin staff took 15 minutes reading every page of my canadian passport like a magazine, where people behind me got seats at other counters. The final verdict - flight is full, sorry for bad seats.  No wifi, food is expensive, no customs forms for Tokyo, sorry. CEO says bad days of discount air travel are over, I think he meant ""its going to be worse"" They have deep pockets (owned by Singapore Airlines) but they are miserly, staff is polite and courteous but machine like, lack empathy - that's culture of Scoot, superficial.",1
"Hong Kong to Manila. Cebu Pacific doesn't have staff that properly handle passenger complaints and it has poor ground service. During boarding, a friend of mine was rudely told by a flight attendant not to stow his small carry on in the designated place below his front seat because an old lady in front put her bag below the seat. My friend tried to explain that he had very small room in the already cramped seating, but the flight attendant never offered to assist my friend nor assist the old lady in putting up her luggage to free up my friends legroom. The staff seem to have no proper training in handling customers especially with legitimate complaints as they shrug it off as 'just a very little problem'. After a cooling of heads and apologies were finally given, we were greeted with another 30 minute delay in baggage claim to end our Cebu Pacific experience.  If you think the 25-100USD price difference is worth the risk of any or all the above mentioned happening to you, then go ahead and book. However, after several average (mostly delayed) flights with them before and this last terrible one, I would avoid this airline.",1
"Flew IndiGo from Chennai to Madurai. The flight was a pretty short one, one hour. During that time, these are the things that I felt about the airline. 1) Check In: The Lines were long, the number of counters were pretty reasonable but could be increased considering the number of flights IndiGo operates. My advice, arrive early. 2) Aircraft: Neat. Clean aircraft. No problems. 3) Crew service: Pretty good. Up to standards. 4) Ground Support: I didn't face any trouble and the staff were pretty helpful too. 5) On Board Meal: it's not complementary. You have to buy it. Tasted good for the money. 6) Punctuality: On-time. No issues there. 7) Communications: Book online. You would get all the information via SMS, even the boarding gate information.",0
"KUL-SGN. Lovely looking stewardesses and new aircraft. Reasonably comfortable seats even for my 6ft 2"" 18 stone frame. But check in immigration departure lounge baggage reclaim? Just prepare to be treated third class and expect to be herded like cattle. They certainly bring a whole new level to ""no frills airlines"". Cheap and great for hopping around South East Asia truly the Greyhound in the skies.",1
"Flew from Christchurch to Auckland and they didnt check the weight of our carry on bags but at the Auckland Jetstar they did. The staff in Auckland airport made sure she checked every single bag even my husbands laptop. Weve flown to a load of places and no airline has made him weight his laptop except this one. Due to this The weight of our carry on bags exceeded 2kg. (Our two suitcases, laptop and my handbag). They charged us $60 saying it has to be checked in. All Jetstar wants is more money. What annoys me is Christchurch jet star didnt weigh our bags. Shouldnt rules be the same for Christchurch and Auckland? When I spoke to another staff member she said that Auckland is Auckland and Christchurch is Christchurch. That doesnt make sense to me. I say thats poor team work and rules arent very consistent. Dont think I will ever fly with Jetstar again. Their cheaper than Air Nz but they try to charge every little cent out of you which then makes it more expensive than Air Nz. I will be going with Air Nz next time.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. Jetstar is completely a joke! They cancelled your flight 30 mins before departing and doesnt care about customers at all. They dont explain properly to customers, and they are very impatient. Flight cancellation happens to me twice without notice and apologies. They overcharged carry on bags for 1 kg overweight ($65) and didnt give me time to repack my bags. They didnt check everyones bags but they wont let you pass when they want you to pay more money. Horrible experience!",1
"Chiang Mai to Phuket. We scheduled flights well before the coronavirus pandemic. When trying to move flights to a different time due to international travel advisories, restrictions, and fear for our health, AirAsia was impossible to get hold of. When we did finally get through via multiple complaints filed, they said we'd still have to pay the change fee or not get refunded. After attempting to contact them numerous other times via every channel possible (AVA, complaints, response to email, attempted to find a phone number with no luck) before our flight was scheduled to depart and we simply never heard back from them. I decided to try them based on price, but it's certainly not worth the lower price.",1
Manila to Legazpi. Worst airline I have ever used. My flight was delayed for over 6 hours. All other flights from this airline were also delayed on this date. It seemed to be due to them not having enough aircraft for the amount of flights they scheduled. I have no idea how this could be a problem with an airline and must just be awful organisation. Avoid flying with them at all costs.,1
I flew Air Asia in July from Bengaluru to Chennai 4 times onward and return as well. The fares were excellent and the planes neat and clean. The price is the Company's UPS which is helping them do well in Malaysia Indonesia and other Asian countries where they fly. The only thing which I did not like was issuing Paper Boarding passes instead of the regular passes. But I heard they have changed this and are now issuing the normal passes. Would surely fly again.,0
"Flew Adelaide to Melbourne-Avalon on Mother's Day with only carry-on baggage booked, I paid the bargain basement price of $58 for a return flight to Melbourne.  I wasn't, however, impressed with Jetstar's new policy of weighing each passenger's carry-on bag as they approach the boarding gate, with the intention of slugging each passenger with excess baggage a small fortune to place the bag in the hold. This is something that should be done at check-in, as it only holds up the queue. On board, the service was good, but not great, and overall tolerable for the short hour-long flight to Melbourne-Avalon. The return flight  on May 17 was very similar, with some divergences. This time, I checked in at the counter (I happened to do some shopping in Melbourne and pre-paid checked baggage), and Jetstar's Avalon Ground Crew couldn't have been more helpful or polite. On board, however, the service was once again good, but nothing to write home about. Overall I'd recommend Jetstar only if there was a significant difference in price between other airlines, including Tigerair (far superior to Jetstar as an LCC in Australia), or if one wanted to fly to Melbourne Avalon Airport, a beautiful little Airport some 40kms out of Melbourne's CBD which was an absolute breeze to visit and to use.",0
"Since 25/12/2022 we arrived in Bali and our bags didn't, Jetstar's service has been nothing short of disgusting, I have given them ample time to find my checked in bag and they don't know where it is. Now they are going to compensate me for my belongings and they have offered 25% of the value of my luggage as a compensation. They don't care about their customers they simply cant be bothered",1
"Purchased baggage in advance with tickets. Tried to luggage drop exactly an hour before flight time at 11.25am which was stated as 12.25pm. System error stating late. Went to the counter, and was told to queue. Spoke to a couple of other passengers and noticed they are the same flight as me, and machine also stated late and hence unable to luggage drop despite them being there way earlier than 1hr before departure. When queue reaches our turn, its 11.45pm. Counter customer service stated too late, cannot luggage drop. We were told to wait for this flight to depart first, then try to request customer service for change to another flight and pay the difference. That sounds ridiculous because the other passengers are ""late"" because AirAsia's own ticketing system has a problem and everyone was asked to queue until they missed the closing time for dropping luggage. I gave my luggage to my wife who drove me here and ran all the way to the departure gate. I arrived at the departure gate at 12.10pm. On the way, custom informed me that system shows I cannot board but I can try. Tried I did. To my surprise, the plane is not there yet at the departure gate when I arrived. This means Airaasia could have helped, but they simply refuse. When I tried to reason to the counter at the departure gate, all I get told was I was late. There is no sense of logic in the heads of these customer service agents. In any case, it is now 1.25pm whilst typing this review. 60 minutes delayed with no notice on estimated delay duration. There are the elderly, and kids here and they just don't seem to be bothered. When queried what is the policy for flight delay and possible cancellation, he says 2 hours first, then denies saying it back and forth. Very unprofessional and unreliable customer service. The flight status board now shows another flight, and my flight just simply gets removed without notice, causing alot of passengers crowding at the desk asking what is going on. For reference, we take AirAsia because it is cheaper sometimes. So we understand and do not complaint if it delays a little here and there. However, the customer service is poor beyond reasoning even after taking into account the slightly cheaper rates.",1
Melbourne to Bangkok. Missing luggage. Waited 45 mins for luggage. Spoke to jetstar representative she claimed and confirmed luggage in Thailand and I have to wait as it coming. All passenger claimed and left. Waited another 1 hour Jetstar representative confirmed 4 times with my baggage ticket number that's it's arrived please wait. Requested to send to hotel was refused. After that again checked and said to me that's luggage is in Melbourne. The worst ever customer service by jetstar.,1
I was also on the Singapore - Coolangatta flight on the 29 January 2013 in Scootbiz and had to pay $12 for a blanket for my 8 year old. This was my second Scoot flight in 10 days and both have been delayed. On the 21st for 5 hours and the most recent flight - 1.5 hours. I understand Scoot is a budget airline but surely basic customer service should still be part of the overall offer. Unfortunately it seems in the airline industry the more you pay for your ticket the better you are treated as a customer.,1
Connection at Madras to Hyderabad (coming from US) and back to Madras connecting to US. Both trips an hour long each. Ground Staff helpful at both ends cabin crew charming and helpful. A320 clean and comfortable ample room in overhead bins. Remembering yester-years of Indian Airlines service attitude it is amazing what the open market brought to traveling Indian public.,0
"Scoot is a very good low cost airline. I would fly it over Jetstar for this route from Perth to Singapore if I am travelling on a low cost airline. The plane was new and clean. We did leave later than expected as the plane flying into Perth got delayed in Singapore. Scoot sent me an email with a bid fo Biz upgrade. I entertained the idea and I bid for it, which I won a day after. However, on the day of check in, there was a change of plane in Singapore hence the delayed flight, and they could not put me in the Biz section so I asked for a refund. After calling their call centre, I was told that I had to call back to check for updates and they do not have the provision to send email updates. Anyway, I am still waiting for my one week period for them to process this.",0
Flew Scoot from Gold Coast flight on time but the horrible weather on the Gold Coast was lucky to leave on time. Had Scoot through for our onward flight to Bangkok but the transfer lounge was so far away and the queue took too long that it would have been just as quick to go through Immigration and rebook in. Flight to Bangkok was good and on time. We flew back to the Gold Coast with Scoot and the night time flight was good with a bit of extra space not all seats full and I felt comfortable in my seat. Flight was about 20 mins late. So our experience was good and for the money excellent value for a budget airline.,0
"Originally my flight from Bali to Jakarta was at 11:50am. Got an email saying they have changed the time to 1:10pm. My connecting flight to Singapore is at 4:15pm, cool still have time. Arrived at the airport around 10am. Flight has been delayed to 2:20pm. Still have time to catch my connecting flight. Didnt board until 2:50. Its currently 3:35pm and still waiting to board everyone now. I dont think Ill make it to my connecting flight. Worst airline I have flown with.",1
We booked months ago a flight to Bali which Jetstar cancelled. No refund has been received after many weeks and I have been told it may even take 12 weeks to see the refund. I managed to get a more expensive flight & longer flight on Garuda. Well done Jetstar for insisting on payment immediately upon booking and then not returning it when you cancelled our flight. Poor business practise and I recommend to everyone to be very mindful Jetstar will cost you money when they cancel their flights!,1
"Would never fly with them again. Booked business class from Lombok to Denpasar as nothing else was available, received only economy when we got there. Wings Air flight was delayed by 4hrs with no information provided whatsoever. We had to ask 4 times in order to be informed of the delay. Staff was extremely rude. Never book with them if you have a connecting flight!",1
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia flight AK718. Used the kiosk to get my boarding pass and went direct to gate. Flight itself delayed 1.15hours due to congestion at the airport thus making us end up sitting inside the plane for the duration of the time. Onboard FA not so friendly and just did the basics but since this was a short flight not a big concern. Overall still a great flight. I choose to fly with them because of the good schedule to select from.,0
"Flew with scoot TR 278, and with a great experience from Singapore to Jakarta. Had smooth journey from took off until landed, thank you pilots and crew TR 278.",0
"Great airline. I had 3 domestic flights with Indigo: Udaipur-Mumbai, Mumbai-Goa and Goa-Delhi. Booking in its website was easy and prices were competetive. Check-in at the airports was easy and fast - Indigo had many counters open in all 3 airports. Flights departured with no delays of more than 5 minutes. The airplanes looked new and very clean. Staff was nice and helpful. On two occasions I ordered a sandwich (about 250 rupees) which was quiet tasty to my surprise. The only downside that I can think of is that the seats are not very comfortable, but it's a low cost airline and flights usually last only 1-2 hours, so it's not such a big deal. Highly recommended.",0
"Brisbane to Sydney. First time I have flown with Jetstar in 3 years, after previous experience with delays. After a relaxing time in the Qantas Club, the boarding process was a bit chaotic with no allocation specifics given. Once onboard the seats weren't the most comfortable but given the flight was only 1 hour, it wasn't too bad. No IFE during the flight so I was quite bored and no complimentary food/beverages, a true sign of LCC. Surprisingly, the flight was on schedule from take off and landed early as I take punctuality very seriously. I would fly Jetstar again to test their consistency and customer service.",0
"Rachi to Vadodara via Delhi. One day prior to my flight IndiGo changed my flight time, and worst part they divided our family of four into 3 and 1. Three of us has one flight and time and single member has another flight with a different time for the same destination on the same day. And when I was travelling many seats were vacant, why they didn't know.",1
We flew Kuala Lumpur to Singapore on 1 August 2014. Total cost was 927MYR (171 or just 329 each). We were astounded at the high quality of the flight the cleanliness of the aircraft and the friendliness and professionalism of the crew. Having paid a very low price (to us in England) we were expecting a below-Ryanair experience but this was anything but. Proper seats seat back pockets a wide range of snacks- this was far higher standard than Finnair offered on their Manchester-Helsinki flights. Will not hesitate to use AirAsia again.,0
"On May 30th, 2018 my husband, mother and myself were supposed to catch our flight from Delhi to Goa with Indigo. However, the day before our flight we received a message stating that our terminal had changed due to renovations in the airport. My husband had called the airlines to confirm and was told that our terminal had in fact changed. Once we arrived at the Delhi airport, security wouldnt let us inside the airport and he kept telling us we were in the wrong terminal. We told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change, but he still didnt want to let us in and asked us to go to the Indigo customer care outside of the airport. When we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one Indigo agent that was there. After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he cant help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to deal with us that was even less helpful. By this time, boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldnt do anything. We asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that. She said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed. By this time, all early flights were gone, and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to Goa for May 30th were booked. We booked our flight with Fly Air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at Delhi. We called the hotel in Goa to advise them we wouldnt make it to the hotel that day, but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day, but unfortunately we couldnt. Because of the service from Indigo airlines and wrong information given to us by them, we had to spend 6 times the price of our original flights, lost 1 day of hotel in Goa and had to book another extra night in Delhi.",1
"I enjoyed my flight. Check in was easy at Adelaide Airport. The flight was on time and the staff were very friendly and efficient. Make sure that carry on baggage is the size and weight as they will check. It may be easier for some passengers to pre purchase check in baggage. Also if you want a bigger meal, it may be a good idea to pre purchase a meal. I liked the ham and cheese toastie! Overall a good flight.",0
"Seated in window seat 23K, Flight number TR606, January 8th 930am flight from Singapore to Bangkok. The plane was spotless, and passengers were well spread out. Maybe 15% full. I was on an SQ ticket so I got the meal: a chicken lemak, with a bottle of water, and some chocolate brownies for a sweet. It was delicious; I've had a few nasi lemak on Air Asia, and this was much better. The chicken came in a rich and unctuous sauce, with the right level of spice, the ikan belis was delicious, there was a generous portion of rice. After a near 5 hour transit at Changi I needed that. I mentioned the cabin was immaculate. I gave Scoot a tough review back in early 2019, but that was pre Covid and it was a long haul from Singapore to Berlin. I'm still of the opinion that for long haul you need a modicum of comfort. For this flight though, less than 2 hours from Singapore to Bangkok, I can't fault Scoot. Good job. I came from Melbourne to Singapore on SQ, on an Airbus A350, so I can make a immediate comparison with the Boeing 787. I prefer the 787, the cabin feels more spacious, the wing is more elegant.",0
Flew Phuket to Chiang Mai and got dinged nearly $60 CAD ($55 US) for a 20 kg bag. When I picked myself up off the floor I asked the desk person if I could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. Told to go to the website check in online and 'pre-register' my bag online. The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look. So watch out! Bag charges are exorbitant and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy.,1
"I flew with Scoot earlier this month from Lucknow to Singapore (TR501). I wanted to call out the excellent service that was provided to not just me, but to multiple passengers on this flight by one of the crew. This must have been a difficult flight to manage with lots of seniors and babies on board but the attitude displayed by one female FA was remarkable. She  put the parents at ease and handled the situation in a most kind and professional manner. She also made it a point to talk to children on the flight and picked them up and took them for little walks whenever she saw the parent looking tired or the child looking restless. I must also mention, how she sternly told off a few difficult passengers who violated the policy of eating outside food, but did not across as rude or harsh. Big fan of what I saw that day. Hands down, the best cabin manager I have seen in action.",0
"This was AirAsia, AK356, an afternoon flight from Kuala Lumpur to Surakarta. The flight departed on time and arrived at Adi Soemarmo International Airport 20 mins ahead of schedule. The flight generally was in fine weather, except for a bit of turbulence during descend into SOC. Landing was good.",0
"Flight from Sydney to Singapore on Feb 21 2013 was 10 hours delayed no text message nor email prior to this and no offer of apology or any meal vouchers. Upon boarding passengers notice a lot of empty yellow seats in the middle whilst everyone was cramped seated right at the back then asked the crew to transfer to which they replied ""you have to pay extra A$68"". After all the taxes and their add ons fees this airline is not cheap. We missed our connecting flights hotel pick up and a night accommodation with no apology. Never again.",1
"Denpasar to Ngurah rai via Bandung. The worst airline I've ever tried. Please anybody if you were having business trip or very tight schedule please please don't use this airline. It is not even professional one. Why? This is based on my experience. Delaying for more than 7 hours, no informing from the management, too many reason explained by the management, waiting for luggage like forever. Very terrible.",1
"I will never fly with this appalling airline again. How can an airline randomly delay flights, not let people know, sitting at airport, no idea when I will fly. Late for work, not sure where bags are. I have flown in third world countries and have never experienced this disgraceful level of service. Do not, I repeat, ever fly this airline. Beyond bad!",1
SYD to MEL on Sept 15th 2014 and return on 18th. Found staff friendly and obliging and the landing back in Sydney on Sept 18th on flight JQ 508 was the best landing I've encountered. The only negative is that Jetstar seems to always be chronically late of advertised takeoff times. Don't know why and don't know if its the companies fault or just airport overload as they are not alone with this constant problem at Sydney and Melbourne.,0
"MEL-BKK Economy A330-200. How does one start with Jetstar International? Firstly the Thai crew are excellent and are far superior to the domestic version in Australia. The aircraft was on time and was a comfortable flight from an engineering perspective. However the interior of this aircraft can only be described as a time capsule whereby the interior designer had a selection of interiors and said ""That's the one - the theme we will go for is recycled 1970's Estonian disco."" To be fair not all of the seats were broken mine reclined on the left side thereby putting my left shoulder on the lap of the person behind me while my right shoulder was touching the back of the seat in front of me. I especially liked the rips in the ""leather"" that allowed me to hang my mobile phone for viewing of videos. Very thoughtful. Also the 3 TV's that came with the plane at the front of interior did not work so we couldn't even follow a flight map. On the return leg same story re interior. I understand that with budget carriers you get what you pay for but I paid for a seat with oxygen and almost got ripped off.",1
"Bhubaneshwar to Mumbai. IndiGo, being a low-cost no-frills airline is a value for money indeed. Although their in-flight menu is bit expensive, one can bring their food from home also, which also save some money. From ground handling to the crews' services, it was an excellent service. The students fare scheme is a boon indeed. Being a student, I always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6% basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance. I also prefer this airlines as they are the most punctual airlines. Looking forward to travel on IndiGo.",0
What a terrible excuse for an airline. My daughter was in Australia for 4 months in a study abroad program and as we live in Hawaii I made the mistake of booking Jetstar to Honolulu as it was the only nonstop from Sydney. I purchased their max. checked baggage allowance of 40Kg (wouldn't let me buy more) although I thought she might be slightly over since basically every other airline allows two fifty lb bags to be checked they cap it at two 44 lb bags. She was 4 kg total over at check in and they told her she would need to pay $25 per kg. I told her to start dumping things in front of the check in desk. She was on a half full flight and 4kg was going to matter? They also weigh purses as part of this luggage scam because you are only allowed 10kg carried on. If you are overweight they probably make you run laps until the plane boards.,1
"This review refers to the flight with Scoot from Berlin to Bali (via Singapore) and the corresponding return flight a few weeks later. The points apply to all legs of the journey, although the long haul Berlin-Singapore and back is clearly more significant and determines the rating. Scoot advertises itself as the small subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (""The little sister of Singapore Airlines""). This is certainly correct in terms of content, but it is absolutely misleading. The service Scoot offers has nothing to do with the fantastic Singapore Airlines! Absolute nothing! Scoot is an absolute no-frills airline in its purest form, even worse than Ryanair. The passenger has to pay for everything. It starts when booking with the food on board, continues with extra luggage and seat reservations. If you don't pay for your seat, a seat will be allocated to you during check-in without any choice for you. And, on board, the customers' money continues to be taken out of their pockets. If you want to drink water on board, which real airlines serve free of charge and in abundance to their passengers for health reasons, you have to pay for it at Scoot. There is no entertainment programme on board, not even monitors to track the flight route. If you use your mobile phone, tablet, etc., you will definitely run out of power during a 12-13 hour flight. There are power sockets, but if you want electricity for charging, you have to pay for it. Regarding the service on board: The staff was always friendly and nice. Thank you for that. But, the food is pretty much the most unappealing and uncharitable food I have seen in my life. And it doesn't even taste good. You are given simple, welded food containers and a can of water. If you know real quality airlines, what Scoot delivers is a huge disappointment. On the return flight SIN-BER, the folding tables (several in my row) were so dirty. I guess they have not been cleaned for a long time. Thank god I had disinfectant and a cloth with me. Yikes, Scoot! In summary, it must be said that the customer at Scoot is apparently only there to flush money into the company. There is no question of appreciation of the flight guests. These flights fall into the category: There is no second chance for a first impression. We flew exactly twice with Scoot, the first and the last time. I would rather spend a little more money on a real, good airline than fly long-haul with Scoot again. For short-haul (up to about 3 hours, it's ok).",1
BKK-MNL-BKK. Flights a little quieter in recent weeks due to the problems in Thailand. Quite large variations in price depending on precisely which days you travel. Cebu Pacific used to have very good last minute prices - not any more and the cost to change a travel date was about the same price as the original ticket. They're also cracking down hard on excess baggage - 15kg for checked in bags and 7kg hand carry. Don't expect to haggle an extra few kilos for free - and they're checking (weighing) bags again at the gate. I'll continue to use them in favour of PAL or Thai since their prices are still very competitive their reliability in my experience has been very good and NAIA-3 is by far the best MNL Terminal - just don't carry too much luggage.,0
"Flight was scheduled at 06.20. Arrived early at the airport around 03.30 am. The information gate  ""check in open"". But nobody at the check in counter. And when I asked the airport security they said it will be open at 05.00 am. I was hoping to be able to check in sooner to be able to rest at the gate. No difference from taking a bus from a bus terminal.",1
"Upgraded our bags anyway as they were larger than normal. Get to the desk before the flight and they come round with their weighing scales asking me to put my bag on which was slightly over, 65$ - absolute joke. You would think they want people to fly with them after the whole covid situation. The woman was very pleased with herself coming round with her digital card reader, just money grabbing. Will not fly with them again. Will not include the cabin crew in this as they were lovely.",1
We flew Business Max class from Melbourne to Singapore and although Jetstar promises that they offer all of the normal business class service they neglect to mention that the seats are only marginally larger than economy and hardly recline at all! There is so little room between the rows that when the passenger in front has his seat reclined it is almost impossible to leave your seat! On a short daytime flight perhaps but on an overnight flight sleep is impossible. The food was however quite good and the alcohol service OK but nothing makes up for uncomfortable seating or the lack of pillows (unbelievable even though they provide a blow-up neck support). They also don't offer the normal express service through immigration etc and no priority baggage handling which is quite annoying. So in summary - a definite improvement on economy seating but by no means the normal business class that they promise but then again you get what you pay for!,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. How come Air Asia could have won an award for best low cost airline? Took 4 Air Asia flights across the weekend, none were on time. Now, my last flight to come back to Singapore is announced on last minute with more than 1h 30mins delay, supposing a technical issue. Staff disappeared and screen even not updated. This is a poor experience and the lower one I have experienced in Asia. Does it worth to waste time and money when again in theory you caught a good ticket fare.",1
"Sydney to Gold Coast Return with Jetstar Airways. The outbound flight was on an older aircraft, seats were less comfortable and more cramped. The Crew on this journey were very cold, not Customer orientated in any way. I understand Jetstar is LCC, but as a business that deals directly with the public you would expect a certain standard plus being part of the Qantas Group should give you an advantage. The return flight was more up to scratch, the cabin was refurbished with a better hard product, and the Crew even remembered that I had a $10 voucher to use onboard. I think the service is very much hit and miss with LCC, my advice is to book with Jetstar for leisure with flexibility in minds, rather then for business.",0
"Dubai to Mumbai. I paid for non-veg snacks and they say mam we are only left with sandwiches Why should i care what are you left with, what I ordered for should be served. The refreshments were served after 1.5 hours. Ill never travel again by indigo and even wont suggest anyone !",1
"A disgrace to Indian Civil aviation. In an almost empty airport and when web boarding pass wasn't available, it took the staff 2 hours to let old and young passengers check in their luggage. No initiative or drive from any staff to care for or even ask the elderly waiting in line and clearly uncomfortable or even share any words of comfort. A workforce alien to human emotions and welfare.",1
"Manila to Legazpi on Cebu Pacific was a flight nothing to write home about except that it was a good flight. Meaning it left & arrived on time. Ground crew at check in were cheerful and considerate. On this flight, we depart using Domestic Terminal or T4 that was packed with holiday-makers, good thing though our flight was not full so boarding was a breeze. With ATR-78 aircraft means the flight took a little longer, but enjoyable though. Baggage with breakables were handled well. Good job Cebu Pacific!",0
Adelaide to Melbourne JQ771 27/2. I'm lucky because I get to depart each Jetstar flight from Adelaide Airport. With 7 departures taken in 6 months using Jetstar I have never had reason to complain about anything. The staff are professional and the pilot always makes clear and informative announcements. I take a comfy rubber mat for additional comfort for longer domestic trips.,0
"I want to really appreciate Mrs Ruchika and it was my pleasure to meet with her as she was really very helpful. I travelled when I was 36 weeks pregnant and I was not feeling good while traveling in flight, she was the only one who helped me in those circumstances, she had given me a head massage, offered me green tea, arranged a best seat according to my situation, she arranged some cushions to put legs on that so I felt very relax. Whatever the possible help she can do, she tried her best, and really its appreciable. Thank you being so kind for me in my bad time. We really need that type service...",0
"You are not allowed to bring your own food or drink onboard, and they do not serve free meals on board unless you bought one. You will not be served any free drinks other than water, the space between the seats is incredibly small, no courtesy earplugs mask or free entertainment. You have to pay if you want to watch a movie, basically you have to pay for everything another company will give you for free, as you would expect on an international flight that wasnt even cheap! (More than 1000$ from Syd to bali and from Bali to Cairns). I will never fly Jetstar again, horrible experience.",1
KUL-CNX. After an excellent flight on Air Asia X from LGW I carried on to Chaing Mai with Air Asia. Standard AA experience especially when compared to the likes of Ryanair in Europe. I had an email several weeks before departure saying that my meal choice was being discontinued and quoted the substitute meal which was quite tast). My only criticism is the website and how one has to be careful not to book something you don't want as I have just done. On the next outbound leg I changed the baggage allowance to no bags but missed it on the return so I have an allowance but no bags!,0
"Legazpi - Manila on 22-April. Flight arrived in MNL 15 minutes early. Of course this is a budget airline so you need to purchase if you want something on board like food, blanket etc. But for people just want to transit from point A to B this is an excellent option as Cebu Pacific offers half of the price less that its rivals.",0
Singapore to Perth. Checked in 30 minutes early no problem. Had to remind check in that we had business lounge and asked for process and direction also had to ask for tag for hand luggage as given on previous trip. Lounge which cost extra was operated by SATS comfortable and better than Qantas lounge we used recently. Good food and drink choice massage chair and internet. No loungers or flat chairs. Boarded plane easily not sure if announcer asked Scoot Biz to board but we got on with no issues. Comfort in seats good I would rate cabin and seats as comparable with premium economy as I've travelled business and generally seats are much wider. Service was good with getting water at start of flight and meal promptly after take off. Would be good to get another drink later in flight to make it more biz style. My big issue was with taking my own laptop on and not getting it to work I downloaded at home before going but could not get it working. My advice hire a tablet for $20 or take your own entertainment. It's a shame as this was the only negative of the experience. Flights all good on timings. Overall it's a premium economy seat with a basic economy/ budget service if the comfort of the seat is important to you then worthwhile.,0
"I paid for three flights, but only flew once, and there's no refund. For the last flight I was supposed to take they wouldn't issue a boarding pass because I was a couple minutes late for their rule to check in 1 hour before departure. So, it ended up costing me over $2,000 to fly another airline because of their rule.",1
"Christchurch to Hobart via Melbourne. I enjoy flying with Jetstar Airways. Friendly service, and engaging cabin crew.  Melbourne bag drop assistants excelling, you saved me a lot of dollars with the ""try rearranging a few items"", after having arrived for a connecting flight with my duty free goods.  Two minor problems. Should passengers in the over-wing exits be sleeping (or pretending to), during the safety demonstration and where do Jetstar source luggage handlers? One suitcase arrived at Hobart in pieces (literally!). I will continue to fly Jetstar and not obsess over a minor hiccup.",0
"$500 round trip from Tokyo to Taipei for a family of four, was a steal and at the same time, too good to be true, we found out the hard way. Service on the plane was decent, attendants treated us with good manners and respect, responded to requests promptly, and was generally very accommodating to the passengers. Plane delayed for 8 hrs at Narita, since Scoot didn't have arrangements with other airlines and we didn't receive the notification email before arriving, we had to sit at the check-in area for 4 hours before being allowed to go through security where we spent an additional 5 hours. Flight was scheduled for 7pm departure but by 6:45pm, the plane was nowhere to be seen, they change the departure time at 7pm, very poorly communicated. Meal vouchers were provided, which was a slight plus. Because Scoot uses one plane to fly through 4 different routes (Brisbane to Tokyo to Taipei to Singapore), delays at any of the locations would cause delays to all rest. On top of that, with the tight turnaround schedule, they had no time to clean the planes. The bathrooms were disgusting. The plane seats were dirty,  not exactly the new plane they had advertised. Greediness also comes to mind looking at how much they charged for water/drinks along with their policy of no food on-board. Carry-on luggage policy is what I had serious issues with. We carried on the same amount of luggage arriving to Taiwan as we did departing but we were told we needed to keep the carry-on weight at 10kg and below for each. Why wasn't this policy enforced from Tokyo to Taipei? Instead of taking everything out of our carry-on, we decided to check our luggage instead but then had to pay $20 per kg after 20kg, so additional $200 was paid for carry-on. To make it more infuriating, the overhead bins were empty on the plane, which means, they forced most passengers to check their carry-on. Seating, coming back from Taiwan, for our family of 4, 2 adults two kids 3 and 5, they decided to separate us and had us in different rows on different sides of the plane. Had the plane been completely booked, we would've been fine with it but there were at least 30+ seats available next to each other by the time we departed. Mind-boggling to us and we just didn't understand why we were placed in different sections of the plane by the check-in agents.",1
Penang to Kuala Lumpur. Good take off and landing. Cabin crew are all very nice and informative. I always choose this airline. You get what you pay right. Dont be such a fussy when you only just a few pennies.,0
"Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur, a lady from third party Hanoi ground staff was rude at check-in. The boarding was chaotic but quick and we departed early and arrived Kuala Lumpur 23mins early. The chief stewardess is good , but I found the other FA is impolite and just want to faster complete their duty only. The seat was cramped with limited leg space for seat 23F, and it was a full flight. With a great surprise flight was lead by a female co-pilot.",1
"BKK-SIN connecting to SIN-SYD on 28/29 November. As other posters have noted it's definitely worth paying for the extra leg room in the yellow ""Stretch"" seats. However the seats themselves are very narrow (10 abreast in a 777) and are uncomfortable with no head rest. The forward economy cabin was also very cold. I pre-paid for meals but wouldn't do so again. In future I would bring my own food. I also pre-paid for ""Scoot-thru."" - the Scoot transfer facility in Singapore for Scoot-Scoot or Tiger passengers. The advantage of doing this is that it provides a similar connection facility to that of just about any legacy carrier. Not pre- paying this fee means that if I had missed the connecting flight I would have had to pay (according to Scoot terms and conditions) a re-booking fare and the fare differential for the next available flight even if the problem was with Scoot. Paying the ""Scoot-thru"" fee also meant that in Singapore I did not have to claim my bag clear customs and check in again for the connecting flight. Instead I was able to organise my next flight at Scoot's transfer facility within the airside departure level. Service is friendly but the staff don't seem particularly assertive. Overall I found Scoot to be cheap and cheerful and if you're a budget traveller I would recommend.",0
"Scoot changed the aircraft at the last minute to a smaller one and offloaded a bunch of passengers including my family from a 9.30 am flight. So we were left high and dry after purchasing confirmed seats. We had to beg for seats on a later flight. They give us boarding passes for a 4pm flight, which was delayed by 2 hours, so we finally take off at 6pm! Also our baggage is handled so badly that my brand new suitcase came out on the luggage belt with black marks on it, looking like an old bag. Never want to use Scoot again! Horrible experience.",1
"If prices do not differ much, go with AirAsia or other airlines. Cebu Pacific is ok if you're travelling lite on a budget. With baggage fees and meals and other add ons, it might end up costing you more or about the same price as competitors. Domestic flights are almost always delayed! Especially flights to/fro Manila. Very early morning or very late evening flights are fine and usually unaffected by delays (if you're fine flying on that time). There is no entertainment and seats do not recline for all international flights I've taken. Prepare for hours of discomfort and boredom if you didn't bring anything to read. Domestic flights, however, do have reclining seats. They have inflight games with prices which are usually CebuPac merchandise. This is the inflight entertainment, and lasts for about 5 minutes.",1
"Jakarta to Jayapura with Lion Air. Flight left and arrived on time. Managed to score one of the rows of empty seats at the back, good for sleeping on this overnight flight. A decent selection of drinks and food were sold on borad, unusual for Lion!",0
5J404 Apr 2nd and 5J405 Apr 9th. CEB seems to attempt promoting people to spend more time at the airport. For our recent family trip MNL to LAO they first informed by email and even followed up by call that the flight departure time was 1.5hrs earlier than scheduled. Just to let us then wait for almost 2hrs at a very crowded gate for the departure with a short note that the airplane had not yet arrived. We certainly would have found a better use in MNL for those 2hrs instead of waiting at the airport. It seems CEB starts their implementation of new schedules with informing their customers but only some time later also telling to the pilots and airport about it - interesting approach. Funny enough once we arrived in LAO the crew even announced proudly we arrived as scheduled! On the return flight they seemed to attempt to make up for it by departing 10min ahead of schedule from LAO. Leaves me wondering why they have a schedule at all?,1
Legazpi to Manila. Checked-in online using their app to avoid any hassle at the airport and so I can go directly to the boarding area as I didn't have luggage to check in. Flight left on time and arrived a little bit early from schedule which was a plus. The weather was fine and the view from window was great. It was a good day to fly.,0
"Manila to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. We did not check-in 2 hours before our flight, our flight was supposed to be 1:05AM and were at the check-in desk at 12:20AM. The lady in the check-in desk told us that our ticket was forfeited because they have cut-off time.",1
Recently my wife and seven other members of my family flew from Surfers Paradise to Singapore. The plane was late leaving Australia and on arrival we were to get a connecting flight to Thailand. On arrival and with great difficulty we found out that along 45 other passengers were left stranded in Singapore. We found out this happens quite often. The staff did not want to help us or even discuss the matter. The extra expense burdened on us. Never again will my family travel budget airlines.,1
Cebu Pacific changed my flight time from early morning to the evening 2 days before the actual flight. Pretty much screwed our vacation. I will never fly Cebu Pacific again. Save yourselves a headache and find other carriers.,1
"Flew from Tokyo back to Singapore and return with transit via Bangkok with Scoot. Never in my life have had such bad service throughout. Long wait to get through the call center to end up with ""I need to put you on hold to check"" with every question I asked and getting an absurd answer which did not make any sense. Got told off by check in staff at Narita  because our soft unstructured carry on was 6 cubic cm over the limit. 3. Got screamed at no food during transit because we bought orange juice for the kids. And comment given ""You must  buy our food. Forced us to wake the 2 year old up to be buckled up in his seat. And woke up the 7 year old because he is not seated properly with legs down. On return transit, got told to hurry up by ground crew from passing security to gate. Whilst they watch us dragging 2 groggy kids + hand luggage.  After the whole fiasco, we appreciated the flexibility and understanding of 2 member of the crew. Male crew on flight back to Singapore who saw the fuss brewing, explained nicely their situation, moved the other passengers and helped arrange the sleeping 2 year old. Check in staff at Singapore who handled the situation nicely on the check in bags. While I know that every airline has different policies to adhere to, I believe it is fair to expect some courtesy and customer centricness. They had really good planes no doubt, however the service was really uncalled for. Living in both Japan and Singapore where services are known to be top notch. This came to us as an even bigger shock.",1
Gold Coast - OOL late Nov. If you like eating poor quality food pitiful ground staff and substandard customer service then Scoot is for you! Offered ScootBiz upgrade which supposedly included unlimited drinks during meal service and a blanket. This was not the case and we got nothing but a better seat for our $169! Customer service has done nothing. Boarding took forever as ground staff were incompetent with only one staff member. I understand you get what you pay for but this airline doesn't even offer that! A very low cost airline.,1
Flew Jetstar from Melbourne to Phuket. 4 of use in total. At check in at Melbourne I thought the check-in staff were quite rude and not at all that happy to assist with their new check-in procedures. Having never used this before we stumbled and the female attendant was quite rude. Felt like she was talking down to us. On the flight 3 of use had 11 GHJ going over with a bulkhead behind us. The seat back still reclines the normal amount and the great thing is no one behind pulling your seat or asking for it to be raised. Watched a few movies over which is quite limited in its selection. Food was roast chicken and another friend had pork. Both meals were quite good. Service was good and overall a good flight. An hour late leaving but made up some time and only half hour late getting in. Return flight we had row 10 GHJ these are great seats. No one in front. Heaps of leg room. Again food and service was good. We landed half an hour early. Overall two good flights.,0
"I am not impressed by Cebu Pacific and doubt I will fly with them again. Was supposed to fly out from Caticlan (Boracay) to Manila but flight got cancelled and we were put on another flight out of Kalibo which is 2hrs away from Caticlan. I had to arrange for a transfer on my own terms. Then the flight out of Kalibo was over an hour late without notification. The boards did not show any flight status's. I had to ask to find out and I was told 30mins delay or more. I thought because Kalibo airport is small that's why it seemed so unorganized. I finally get to Manila where I have a connecting flight to Hanoi. And it happens again. Gate changes twice flight delayed without any notification. No one at the gate to assist. No communication whatsoever on why we aren't boarding at the time indicated on our boarding passes. My flight ended up being delayed by over an hour again. The staff are polite and helpful but they should be trained to be more proactive in updating passengers. The flight cabin is also tight not much leg room if you are 5'7"" or taller. Planes are also quite loud. All in all my experience has been disappointing.",1
Flew from DPS to Yogyakarta. Early morning flight boarding and take off on time. Smooth flight on a new B737. Requested exit row seat and was allocated this.,1
SYD-KUL was 30 minutes late but the food was okay. The only things I really did was play on my ipad because the flight was very boring. KU-SYD night flight was on time but no food or beverages. Toilets were clean on both flights and the seats look brilliant but 2 hours into the flight you can clearly see the poor padding. I also couldn't get to sleep on the night flight. Overall Air Asia is ok but I would prefer Qantas or Virgin.,0
"Jetstar Airways from Cairns to Sydney, and a nickel and dime airline! Paid $300 to check 2 bags on my flight. They acted like it wasn't a big deal and there was not a thing they could or would do to help my situation. This is all because we didn't check the box to check our baggage when booking through a third party website - an option we don't remember seeing. You have to pay for all drinks, except a cup of warm water. You don't save money with this airline, and they will nickel and dime you until you pay just as much or more as another airline, who has all of their fees upfront.",1
"This is the first time in 20 years of flying. I have never had to ask for water so many times, it was a struggle just to get water. They had no in flight, anything. Even the onboard entertainment was not working, on an international flight they had the worst in flight service. It took them 30 min just to serve water. After the water they served no juice of any kind. Their in flight meal was disgusting and it was late arriving. Not worth the hassle, experience, and service.",1
Goa to Mumbai. It was a worst experience we had at Goa airport while travelling back to Bombay. We got to Indigo counter at 43mins prior. However we were denied for boarding as we were 2 mins late and were asked to pay difference of 10500Rs for next flight. We tried requesting the ground staff but they were arrogant and didn't show any respect or courtesy. It seemed like we have to live on their mercy to get on board to get back to Bombay. As it was way below self respect we decided to book another flight with Air India and got back home. It was most inferior action by the Indigo staff which could have been avoided.,1
"Bali to Singapore. Inept ground staff at Bali airport, refusing to allow cabin baggage,  no formal size measure applied. The cabin crew harassing us for change of seats as we were given some premium seat while checking in.",1
Bad experience. They did not serve corporate meal to me. I asked them before landing then they come with some meal available. They serve this 15 min before landing and served when I asked for it. I observed there attention is on who are passenger who are buying meals. Even served food are not sufficient. Flight is also delayed by 1 hour. Don't want to fly again with them.,1
Its my first time flying after over a year. Flight booking for Cebu Pacific is convenient although I don't like their current 32kg - 1pc baggage allowance. Airport check in was fast and crew were efficient and helpful - I checked in a few minutes before closing and they are very helpful. The plane was late and we waited a few more minutes to board. Boarding was okay as per the current pandemic state and the gate personnel are very keen to remind passengers of safety protocols. Aircraft was clean upon boarding. Staff are helpful with the baggage. Flight was smooth until landing. Deplaning via bus gates are the worst at Manila. Baggage claim was quick and no damage to my bags,0
"I booked a flight from Denpasar to Jakarta on 16 April The company changed from JT31 to JT25, no big schedule difference Then they changed from JT25 to JT15, 2.5 hours later So I used their involuntary change process to book another flight ID6517 at the same time as my original flight Then they informed me that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours They never provided any explanation They kicked me off JT25 but this flight was not canceled so I guess they gave my seat to someone else Their help desk never answered. I recommend to avoid this company and sisters companies such as Batik air.",1
"This review is for the return trip from Bangkok to Gold Coast via KL. On the way over we flew an overnight flight. It was the coldest flight I have been on. Even with boots, jumper, scarf and our own blanket we were cold. When we arrived at the Gold Coast, the outside air temperature was 16 degrees - that felt warm. Moreover the lights were left on until very late (approx. 2.5 hrs after take off) and turned on very early (approx. 3 hrs before landing). We had very little time for sleeping. In conclusion, it was the most uncomfortable flight we have traveled on. On the return trip, we were notified via email around 3.40 am that the flight was about 3 hour delayed, however we left home at 5am and had not checked our email so we were not aware of the delay. When we arrived at the airport we tried to ask staff to issue us a Boarding pass for the next available connecting flight to Bangkok from KL as we knew we would miss our originally booked flight. However we were told they could not do that but she assured us that Air Asia staff in KL would be able to get us a flight to Bangkok that evening. When we arrived at KL we (and other passengers who missed their connecting flights) were made to wait at the transit desk for around 40 mins before we were notified that all of us had to stay overnight in KL and fly the next day. In the end we gave up realising that nothing could be done, we had no other choice but to fly the following morning. It was about 3 hours before we could leave the airport with other passengers.",1
Traveled to Denpasar Bali on Dec 2013. Had no issue with the QZ flight the ground staff and flight crew in KUL were attentive and nice. However for the return flight the ground staff in Bali didn't even bother to explain to us regarding the flight delay it was delayed over 3 hours. No refreshments at all. Just an announcement regarding the gate change. I've had delayed flights with AA while in KUL they provided us info on why the aircraft was late even meal vouchers and food but not in Bali. Very disappointing!,0
"In the last 3 days, I have seen this airline cancel flights without warning and leave people stranded. My girlfriend and I tried to fly to Hanoi but her passport did not have six months left on it by 2 weeks. We were informed that if we got an emergency passport we could fly. It took 3 days due to holidays but we finally received it (passport). Excited to head to Vietnam we arrive at the airport to check in and the gate attendant tells us we now need a visa with a stamp. Something we were told we could apply for when we landed. Vietnam during this time was under a national holiday so nothing was being processed for at least another 3 days. We had already miss several tours and visits we were excited to see and a much needed spa day. Cebu Pacific knew there was nothing we could do with this new policy of theirs. They are getting 3 stars and not 0 because we have had one flight that was uneventful.",1
BKK-KUL BKK-HKT (two times) BKK-URT-BKK BKK-CEI-BKK. Flight was nice cabin crew helpful and responsible price cheap compared to other airlines. I would recommend them.,0
Perth to Singapore. Nothing special but this what you expect flying with budget airliners. Returning we were scheduled to fly from Singapore to Jetstar on the 2.20am flight. On arrival we saw that the flight was listed as 'cancelled'. We proceeded to speak with ground staff who vehemently denied any knowledge of flight cancellation and to their understanding the flight was still scheduled for departure as planned. We proceeded to check in and entered the departure gates. 2 hours prior to departure announced that the boarding gate had been changed. We went to this new arbitrary gate number but there was no boarding or ground staff in the vicinity. We waited patiently for 1.5 hrs 20 minutes prior to scheduled departure another passenger arrived to inform us he had confirmation that the flight had been cancelled. We were left to seek out the Jetstar information counter at which point the counter manned by 2 young and inexperienced staff members was swarmed by hundreds of passengers both from the cancelled flight as well as passengers from other flights seeking out their departure tickets. It was 2 hours before we were able to speak with a Jetstar ground staff who informed us 'they would place us on the next available flight - which could possibly be the flight on the following day or even a few days down the road if a seat could not be secured.' When asked about how passengers could go about making claims or trying to find alternative flights out of Singapore Jetstar staff could only offer a measly piece of photocopied information sheet explaining that the flight was cancelled and that should passengers choose to find their own alternative flight carrier that this would mean Jetstar bears no responsibility in fully refunding claims.,1
Flew their Singapore to Cambodia new service back in February. Check-in tried to charge us for excess luggage on the way back after we had paid for 30 kg already. Tried it on the couple in front of us also. Luckily we had our original online bookings done via Qantas docs printed with us. Our friends on the earlier flight during the week were made to re-check their luggage in Singapore but we were not also another level of inconsistency. Fly Silk is my advice until they have got their act together or fail which may not be far off looking at the way they seem to be going. Sadly we thought it was Emirates but it must have been a shared flight with Qantas. Oh well never again sorry Qantas.,1
Launceston-Melbourne return 7th June. Both flights on time or early. A320 clean and flights uneventful. Check-in quick and easy and as usual this is strictly a no frills method of travel one step up from coach travel. Crew friendly to Melbourne but on return trip crew was abrupt and a little rude. I have a disability and they offered me no assistance with my bag in the overhead compartment and seem to avoid me when I am lifting and holding a walking stick. On the flight from Launceston one male crew member was a little more sympathetic but they always seem to go out of their way to avoid dealing with anything other than the norm. I use the airline regularly and the fares are usually reasonable but I am mindful that the crew are usually not interested and do the bare minimum.,0
"No doubt Indigo is best LCC in India, smooth check in, on time sequential boarding and departure. Okay seats, clean hygiene cabin, courteous cabin crew. Another good experience and reason to fly again with them next time.",0
"Sydney to Melbourne. Absolutely disgusted that a staff member was giving incorrect information and telling passengers they cant put anything in their pocket. Passengers had less than 2kgs over and were made to pay for extra baggage. When I went to customer service to ask, they confirmed you can have items in your pocket! Their excuse was the lady telling people incorrect information was new and didnt know the rule!  Thats appalling. Staff should know the rules.",0
"Scoot is an excellent medium/long haul budget airline. I took ScootBiz from Sydney to Singapore and didn't expect a budget airline to be so comfortable. It had sufficient legroom, comfortable seats, and adjustable headrests. Although there were no entertainment screens, the ScootTV streamed to my computer was good.",0
Flew Scoot biz Perth to Singapore return. Brilliant. Great seats. Excellent service. Left on time and arrived early. Take your own entertainment. Food basic but good. Remember what you paid and appreciate the amazing value for money. Will definitely use Scoot Biz again. I suspect the Biz part is important. Don't know about economy but Biz seats were huge and comfortable and worth every cent.,0
"Bangkok to Krabi. The check-in was fast and the ground staff friendly. For a low-cost airline AirAsia offers a good seating distance, for a small extra charge and food and water as a drink. The plane made a well-kept and well-maintained impression. With this airline you get a good price-performance ratio.",0
OOL to SIN. Upgraded to ScootBiz at Gold Coast Airport. Check in was running very smoothly. It is important to recognise that ScootBiz is not a business class cabin it is akin to Premium Economy. Food was reasonable comfy seat and good leg room (similar to exit row in economy). First time using the GoGo streaming IPad app on board - worked a treat. Overall the airfare was approx 50% cheaper than the legacy airlines heading to Singapore from BNE. Well worth a try.,0
Kolkata to Guwahati and Kolkata to Bangalore. Check-in okay not too friendly. Aircraft were new so cabins kept clean. Seats okay. Cabin crew better than ground crew. Cheap tickets. The only complaint is that the food is expensive - INR 150 for chicken sandwich is too much considering it's just a 2 piece sandwich which you can get for INR 50 at super-markets. The great thing about IndiGo is the on-time performance.,0
I flew Singapore to Gold Coast return. Flight took off on time the seats were comfortable compared to other budget airlines. FAs were nice and attentive. On the flight back to Singapore we were given a chocolate bar! Would definitely fly Scoot again I hope they will open Singapore-Melbourne route in the future.,0
Pekanbaru to Bandung and vice versa. During the flight there was nothing too special. Special services for passengers with red carpet service in Pekanbaru - nothing. Should correspond to their advertising - red carpet passenger will be allowed to board the plane first but red carpet passengers in Pekanbaru were mixed with ordinary passengers during boarding. In fact there were regular passengers before me on my first flight.,0
"Cheap and nasty sums up this airline. Flew Denpasar to Adelaide and as soon as I joined the check-in lines I was glad I'd booked my return trip on Virgin Australia. Queues at check-in were horrendous and the Melbourne flight had been cancelled so many of that flight's passengers were shifted onto the Adelaide flight. On board people can't pay cash for food and drink which seems ridiculous especially if they aim to save time. I was sat in the middle of the plane and they took over an hour to reach me and by the time they got to me they'd run out. When I asked for a fourth beer they stopped serving me because I'd ""had enough"" which is ridiculous given a) I was paying for it b) even a teetotaler wouldn't get intoxicated on four small cans of beer and c) their service had been lousy. If I go back to Adelaide next year I think I'll pay a premium to go with Singapore Airlines from Surabaya where I live even if I do have to backtrack and add 2 hours onto my journey because one doesn't get all these annoyances on full-service airlines that you get on these budget carriers.",1
"MEL to HBT on A320 20 Sep. Queued 45 mins for ticketing very slow only 4 staff on duty at Melbourne check-in. Booked with Qantas FF points and could not pick your seats so my wife and I didn't get to sit together not good. Sent to gate 27 to board gates 24 to 30 are in the bowels of the Jetstar terminal under all the other gates in a rough concrete ""bunker"" at ground level which means a walk out to the aircraft and then up steps to board! On board the seats were OK but the space between rows was very tight which is fine for a 1 hour flight but not good for longer. The staff were friendly but not really interested. Only an average experience for our first Jetstar flight will think twice before flying with them again.",1
"Another good experience, best Indian LCC. Before time arrival, clean and hygienic cabin. Courteous cabin crew, ok seats for short ride. What more we expect from a LCC, recommended.",0
June 8th flight 3k132. Flight due to leave 00.05 told there would be a 20 minute delay it ended up being 3 hours then told the flight was cancelled. Why take so long to make a decision It was rescheduled for 14.30 that afternoon I missed my pick up driver when we arrived in Singapore had to wait another hour.,1
"Cebu to Siargao. Cebu Pacific is the worst! This is our second time flying this airline within 2 weeks of visiting the Philippines and it was always late. We were to fly a third time using this airline out of Siargao to Manila but we decided to just take our losses and booked with another airline. Before this, they changed our flight times without notification. They don't offer any refunds or compensation. They offered to reschedule (obviously since we don't have a choice!) only and not even a refund. I truly wonder how a company like this stay in business with the way they run things.",1
My wife travelled on Indigo flight 6E-459 from Mumbai to Chennai on 20/3/2018. She arrived late at the airport in Mumbai. There was a flash strike by Uber which she booked earlier and she had to take an auto at the last moment to travel from Thane to the domestic airport. The Indigo staff at the Mumbai airport were very helpful in arranging to board the aircraft at the last moment. She was travelling alone and had no knowledge of Hindi. The Ground staff of Indigo also arranged to send her luggage in another aircraft travelling to Chennai. We had a few tense moments till she arrived safely here at Chennai. To our pleasant surprise the baggage was also delivered personally by Indigo staff at Chennai within an hour. I wish to place on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to all the Indigo staff who helped her out both at Mumbai and Chennai.,0
Having returned from a 3 week trip around SE Asia flying 6 legs with Air Asia I have to recommend their service aircraft ground staff cabin crew and pricing. We had the pleasure of flying Air Asia out of KL and Thai Air Asia out of Bangkok HCMC and Phisanulok. On all occasions check in was quick and efficient with clear direction given boarding spoken in English seat allocation and comfort fine with ample space for the short haul flights FA's were well presented with good command of English flights all left on time food and beverage acceptable with good pricing compared to other budget airlines no IFE but most people talked to their partner the old fashion way of communication which made the flight seem short. Overall my wife and myself were very pleased we chose Air Asia to travel around SE Asia and would have no hesitation in booking to fly with them again.,0
"Sydney to Nadi with Jetstar Airways. My checked luggage did not arrive with my flight in Fiji until 4 days after I arrived. This is is because, and I quote an employee, the aircraft had too many bags, so we had to take some off. When I returned home I began seeking compensation for the lazy mistake but the advisor was only willing to pass a message onto management.",1
"Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney 4-5 October 2012. For a tall person leg space for seating good and comfortable. General in flight service good. Cabin crew friendly. For the ground crew at Bangkok a suggestion - a smile it goes a long way. The ""call"" button in seats in wrong place - easy to push when sleeping.",0
We booked tickets from Gold Coast to Bangkok. First flight was 5 hours late meaning we missed our connection in Singapore. Even though we'd booked this as one return flight Scoot considered these to be separate flights therefore the missed connection was our problem not theirs so we had to book a new trip with Tiger to Bangkok as well as losing our prepaid accommodation and having to pay for a night in Singapore. Very little communication or explanation from Scoot no offer of any compensation or even a complimentary bottle of water. Promise of a $30 scoot voucher that never arrived. On our flight home via Singapore from Bangkok our flight was three hours delayed. From Singapore home it was delayed a two hours that turned into about four. My expectations are never very high for a budget flight but no matter how cheap it isn't worth this service.,1
We just flew Gold Coast -Singapore - Gold Coast on Scoot Biz and they would have to be the worst seats in the sky. No foot rest extremely thin and uncomfortable. Scoot have missed a golden opportunity to snatch market share from Air Asia who have flat bed seats in Biz. Feedback from other passengers was identical to ours in that they won't fly them again unless seating improves dramatically.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Labuan. Flight was delay over 2 hour. Little to none information was given until everybody was aboard the flight. Boarding was choas with ground staff not using the PA system.  Sudden change of gate, having to run from one gate to other due to limited seats at gate. Very hard on hand carry baggagge that even a small extra bag was sent away.",1
I travelled from Bangalore to Jaipur. The leg space between seats was the length of my iPad. If the seat in front is reclined it would hit you face. Very uncomfortable amongst the low cost carriers. Looks like the airline is interested in making money by cramming more seats.,1
"Seoul Incheon to Singapore via Taipei. Scoot flight was fairly uncomfortable for me both to and fro. The seats were stiff and uncomfortable, there were no meals provided for 8 hour flights, they had to be purchased separately. The flight back from Korea was delayed for 2 hours, everyone who had to detour in Taipei was stuck for 2 hours and this was in the midnight 1-3am. I felt very sorry for a little girl who was extremely tired but since we arrived late from the Korea flight there were no seats left at the waiting area in Taipei so she had to sleep on the ground with her bag under her head. Both times I boarded the flight, both arrived late. No compensation was offered and the pilot claimed it was due to Taipei's runway being closed. Personally, I did not feel that the announcement sounded apologetic, it seemed more like an excuse to me. Afterall, the flight was already an hour late upon arrival in Taipei so clearly whatever the runway issues were the late arrival had nothing to do with it. A more comprehensive view of all the problems with my trip with Scoot. It was booked by my company therefore I was not given the choice to pick. When I checked the itinerary the first thing that alerted me was no 25kg check-in baggage. My boss' secretary booked it and when I asked she mentioned she did not know it was not provided because she assumed that all international flights would include it. Therefore, we had to pay for the baggage which eventually summed up to cost even more than Vietnam Airlines which already included the baggage fees (I did a price comparison on my own). I was sent on a two week business trip which required me to ship a laboratory equipment back. Another problem cropped up when I was supposed to ship the parcel back. I was paged by one of the airline personnel to the boarding gate. She informed me that the parcel has been detained because it does not fit the airline regulations. Firstly, like all the other normal, regular people, I do not read all the airline regulations although I have a rough understanding of what is allowed and what isn't. This knowledge obviously does not comprise of laboratory equipment and other aspects which are uncommon to be brought on board - if there was a problem they should have alerted me during the check-in of my bag, not when I am about to board a plane. The staff then told me I have to leave the equipment behind. She was pretty rude, trying to shove her piece of airline regulation in my face telling me that the specifications for the equipment exceeds those of the airline regulations. I am not Korean and the manufacturer's description were in Korean. I told her to open it and read it herself and I have no problem with that. She told me they already did and I just cannot check this in. She did not give me any solutions to my dilemma. What I got from her was basically, ""Miss, the airline does not allow us to take this on board, so please just dump it here and get on your flight."" I was obviously very annoyed by this as I had paid for the excess baggage. So I told her if the baggage is now left behind, I should at least be refunded for my baggage fees. She gave me a downright no. There was no effort being put into trying to make the customer happy. She didn't even offer to ask. All in all, no more Scoot for me.",1
When 4 of us were flying from BKK-KUL on 15 Dec there was a 2 hrs delay and we missed our connecting flight to Kuching. All flights to East Malaysia were fully booked to an extend where no standby passengers were allowed. We tried to check with all other airlines none were available. When I presented my case to AirAsia counter at LCCT somehow the counter staff was able to fly us home. We appreciated their effort to make our travel comfortable even in a 'hopeless' situation. Most recently when AirAsia halted their KL/CMB/KL flights 14 of us were affected from 27 Feb to 5 Mar. Refund was fast even our connecting flights were refunded. Value for money. In terms of comfort services and planes are good. LCCT is sometimes below par especially the female washrooms - wet and smelly! Hopefully the new KLIA 2 will be a better terminal.,0
CGK - Lombok DPS - CGK on new 737-900. Using the domestic terminal in Jakarta it was pretty hectic. One thing that bothered me the crew did not check the name on the boarding pass with our ID. The flight to Lombok was delayed for an hour while we were onboard. Seats and service were decent since we were using the old plane. Getting back from Bali to Jakarta was terrible. Using the new B737-900 the seats was seriously tight - have never flown any plane with seats that uncomfortable.,1
"Hobart to Melbourne. They try to steal as much as they can with the weight. For every kilo you pass they will charge you 25 dollars. Thats insane, try using other airlines more comprehensive, if you pass one kilo they will charge It. One flight they charged me something but for the next one, with the same amount of kilos they tried to charge me more. Wherever they can earn more money they will take advantage of it.",1
"It is expected that Lion Air JT 955 (Lombok to Bali) would be late departure as most Lion Air flights are after midday. The two hour delay ""for operational reasons"" was expected however with no notification of the delay until you reach the airport always makes things frustrating. The biscuits and water for the children helped pass the time. However, when boarding, we all felt claustrophobic and short of breath. There seemed to be no air conditioning and the temperature in the airplane had each of us sweating profusely with most travellers only getting relief from using safety cards to fan themselves. Towards the end of the short flight it did really seem that we were cooking in the aircraft. Relief was only felt when getting outside the back door to get some fresh cool air. While I understand Lion Air is usually late other than if you catch an early morning flight, the travel conditions on this particular flight was extremely uncomfortable and unnerving for the family.",1
Flew Air Asia India from Bangalore to Chennai. Check-in smooth and efficient. Boarding completed before time and pushback 10 minutes ahead of schedule. New and clean aircraft manned by an efficient cockpit and cabin crew. Landed in Chennai 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Looking forward to them expanding to more destinations within India.,0
Originally was meant to go Gold Coast to Adelaide. Arrive at airport. Get a text the flights been cancelled. No more flights from that airport for 6 days they transfer me to Brisbane (had to stay the night and fly the next day) book 2 new flights as its now needed to be a connecting via Melbourne with a 2 hour stop over. Wake up the next morning. About to head off to the airport. They text to say the new flights have been cancelled. ABSOLUTE JOKE OF AN AIRLINE. Never ever will I fly JetStar again and I will tell every living sole on earth not to. The staff at GC JetStar were really great and did the best they could.,1
Perth to Bali. What a joke of an airline! Delayed for 30 hrs and not compensated what so ever. No help from the customer service team. They're dirt cheap for a reason. Wouldn't recommend anyone using this airline,1
IndiGo is my preferred airline on the Dubai to Mumbai route - especially when not carrying checked in baggage. Good on-time airline and good flight timings. Courteous and mostly well trained staff - no inflight entertainment. Food and drinks paid as it's a budget airline.,0
"While Indigo does boast about its on time departure and pre time arrival, I don't think that is what makes it the best airline. I have never liked the attitude of many Air Hostesses on this airline, as I have always found them on the edge of being rude. However, my recent experience was a fantabulous one and I need to appreciate two women, who made this journey a happy one. Joyce - Based at the Indigo counters in Hyderabad, automatically upgraded my seat from 4C to 1C, seeing that I am a tall man and would have issues in the back seats. Janett - Air hostess on the flight 6E - 796, departure time 1950, dated 30.3.22. She was extremely hospitable and showed all signs of a great hospitality professional. She was kind, understanding and spoke to all passengers in a polite manner.",0
"First Of all, their website and app are trash. then, there is their scammy add-on system where initially they suggest adding premium flex but without allowing change in baggage weight. Later if I want to add luggage I have to pay exorbitant fees. Next, their flights are never on time and are frequently rescheduled. The staff are unprofessional and uncouth. Even the flight's interior is not clean! They make false claims of allowing free rescheduling but add multiple fees which makes rescheduling ridiculously expensive. Please for the love of god, never get on these flights.",1
"Air Asia 11.35 flight from Bangalore to Delhi is delayed for the second consecutive time we have used them. All the time they give same reason, incoming aircraft delayed. Fed up with this airline, would be better changing the flight time to stop wasting passengers time.",1
"Ho Chin Minh City to Kuala Lumpur. Bad to worse from the start because I had a renewed passport (even though I showed them the old passport). On the return leg from KUL to SGN, whilst boarding I was pulled out of line, both the old and new passports taken off me (which I eventually demanded back). The staff checking boarding passes was suspicious of anyone handing her a smartphone boarding pass. What's the point of using the AirAsia App if we get dirty looks when using it for storing boarding passes? Anyway, her supervisor contacted his supervisor using WhatsApp then after sending pictures of my passports to him, I was finally allowed to board.  After boarding, the flight attendants serving food want to see your boarding pass, which means if you have it on your phone (and you are sat at a window seat) you have to pass it to be inspected.",1
It was nice journey onboard Thai Lion Air (SL8201) on route Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok Don Mueang. New Boeing 737-900 had not enough legroom but it was quite nice. The problem was that our flight was delayed about 15 h and there was no any announcement about it. Another problem is that during booking I couldn't choose my seat or check-in online. Price was very affordable. I will recommend and choose Thai Lion Air again.,0
"Bali to Melbourne. I booked my flights to and from Bali with Jetstar. Both directions my partner and I were forced to sit seperately. After speaking on the phone and in person, I was denied to change seats so that we were able to be together. I am a terrible flyer and was in tears at the airport for an hour before our flight. Will never fly again, and would definitely not recommend.",1
Flew TZ7 Perth to Singapore 18th August and returned TZ8 25th August. Medical emergency onboard during the outward journey meant we returned to Perth. Cabin crew were First Class in their handling of the situation. It was our first flight with Scoot and we were more than happy with the flight and service once resumed. We selected yellow seats in the quiet zone a good decision as we are both tall and the extra leg room made for a comfortable journey. The return trip was good also. Last year we did a trip to Japan using Malaysian Airlines and were less than impressed with the service. Their only redeeming factor was a 30kg baggage allowance. On balance we would fly with Scoot again if we could.,0
Pune to Delhi. I had booked my meals under Corporate Plan. I was served food only 15 minutes before the flight was to Land i.e 1.5 hrs after the flight took off. The service started late and then the crew were serving/selling in each row going back to front rows serving water discussing menu options with those buying and chatting amongst themselves. On other airlines food is first served to those who pre-book. After selling to all they don't have many items left for serving. Suggest they keep the standard menu and serve pre booked passengers first.,1
"We booked travel in December 2022 through Flight Centre with Scoot (TR17/304) departing Perth at 1800 hrs on 04 June 2023. On 03 June 2023 we did an online check in and discovered our flights had been cancelled and new flights booked departing 3 hours earlier. Had we not done an online check in we would have arrived at the airport and missed the rescheduled flight. At no time were we made aware of the changes either by Scoot or Flight Centre. Nor were we advised that our return flights from Ho Chi Minh had also been substantially altered so that what should have been a 2 hour transit became an 18 hour transit. More on that later. The flights were 2 hours late departing we were given some sort of childs gift pack as compensation. Attempts to raise the matter have seen many emails sent without a plausible response. They now deny there was a booking at all and no longer respond. Just another junk low cost carrier, pity its backed by Singapore Airlines it reflects badly on them. After our return flight on the 18/19 June we wont use them again. Wouldnt recommend at all.",1
"Jetstar is both very poor value and a very poor experience when compared to either Virgin or Qantas Value $50 cheaper for the flight v the other two but Basic Seat selection $7 each way,  Only 7kg free, $27 for additional 7kg. No airbridge in Melbourne raining, terminal door late opening.",1
"Manila to Davao. I don't recommend this airline at all. I was waiting since 2:00 am today and waiting right now for 4 hours already ans they still dont know when the Boarding time will be. They are distributing biscuits and a bottle water for breakfast but I hope they would realize that our time is more precious than those foods.  They have different promos to attract some customers, and in exchange are the Delays of the flights. I always pay the regular Price of this Airline, but still it does not make difference at all!",1
"We had booked a flight (AK882) from Kuala Lumpur on 11.30am on 12/24/2022 to Bangkok. This flight was booked six months ago so that we can leave for Thailand after staying two days in KL. On 12/21/2022, we were notified by AirAsia via email that our flight (AK882) was cancelled due to aircraft downsize and we were re-scheduled to leave KL at 6.50am the next day (12/25/2022). Out of curiosity, we did an online search and we saw AirAsia still have other flights available from KL to Bangkok on 12/24/2022, but with higher ticket price, so we contact AirAsia support via chat and tell them that we have to be in Bangkok on 12/24 for our vacation activities and hoped they could re-schedule us to the same day flights. To our surprise, the support staff were not helpful at all by keeping on saying ""no, we don't have any seat available for flights on 12/24"". We ended up rebooking our flight with Malaysia Airlines to fly to Bangkok on 12/24. We are still awaiting the refunds for the canceled flight from AirAsia.",1
"Flew IndiGo from Jaipur to Kolkata. Take off and landing was smooth. Departure and arrival was on time. Seats were comfortable. Check-in was done smoothly. While boarding the aircraft the cabin crew welcomed us but not with their smiling faces. When I saw the air hostess serving water I asked for a glass of water, she didn't give me one but instead carried on serving water to other passengers even though I had asked before anyone else. On asking again twice, she replied twice ""I'll come back"". After that, I was given glass of water.",1
Hong Kong to Bali via Bangkok. AirAsia exceeds my expectations the staff are some of the friendliest and helpful staff Ive ever met on a budget airline! Everything I here negative about the company doesnt make sense Ive been travelling now for 6 months around south east Asia and every month I use them at least 1-2 times maybe more! They are an incredible airline!,0
"Very impressed. These seats are marketed as Business Class 'Lite' i.e.. you are getting a flat bed seat but not much else for the ticket price. However, I would actually rate the experience with Zip on this flight from Tokyo to Singapore more highly than my experiences with other airlines such as British Airways, who constantly disappoint. The value for money is way better that's for sure. As is the customer service. In summary: Check in process could have been better. Had to wait in queue for about half an hour. I think all passengers are required to manually check in at a desk for this flight. Or at least we were on this occasion. No fast track for business class. On the flight itself, the seats were very comfortable. The blanket provided was especially nice. As were the slippers. The restrooms were very clean and the toiletries provided were ample. Things like mouthwash, hand cream, etc. The staff were excellent. Polite, attentive, courteous. The food was good for what it was. I had spicy chicken with rice. It was basically a microwave meal but still tasty. The fruit was fresh and flavoursome. Free Wi-Fi for business class. Although this is a given on most premium seats, there are still airlines who cash in on charging for Wi-Fi (British Airways for example), so its nice that Zip provide it for free. I would definitely fly with Zip again.",0
"Singapore to Sydney. For the most part, this airline does what they say on the box. It's a budget airline so you know you'll get the bare minimum unless you pay more which is fine. I was really disappointed with the meal service, I prebooked a ""meal, drink and snack"". They gave me no choice of drink and would only give me a 350ml bottle of water which I think is really misleading.  The meal was served almost immediately after departure for an 8 hour flight and I was told I couldn't  have it later. The flight left at about 0715 and my meal was a lunch/dinner option yet they served it as breakfast anyway. Refusing to give me an option honestly made it seem like they were rushing them out ASAP to get it out of the way since they already had my money, choosing to not care about what the customer wants, and hoping the unnecessarily early meal would lead to me needing a second meal later in the flight. I fly scoot semi-regularly and will never pre-book a meal again as a result. If it's any cheaper to pre-book it's only by about $1-2, so definitely not worth being misled about the drink and then force-fed the second you get on the plane. The stinginess with drinks doesn't even go away in their business class cabin which I've flown a couple of times in the past. They say you get a complimentary alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink, but upon asking for something like a whiskey and coke, you get told that whiskey is one free complimentary drink, so if you want coke it's a second drink you have to pay for! The only other issue I encountered was with the automatic check-in, where it refused to take my bag several times despite it being well within all the relevant limits. However, even with that delay, it was much quicker than with many other airlines so I can't really complain. I can't really fault the airline otherwise, they do pretty good deals and the seats aren't too bad. There's no inflight entertainment but in this day and age, I'd rather download something on my phone. Just ensure you have plenty of power as you'll be charged if you want to use the USB charger in your seat. I wouldn't recommend Scoot for a long journey like Australia to Europe, but for flights up to around 8 hours they're fine, just don't expect much other than a seat and a safe journey.",0
"I was very worried as I have had a lot of bad experiences with Jetstar recently, but this was a very good flight. Easy check in, friendly staff and punctual flight. The pre purchased ham and cheese toastie was tasty too. If only more Jetstar flights were as reliable in getting passengers from A to B I would fly them more often.",0
Hobart to Sydney. Jetstar is purely money-oriented company! They did not refund airfares to Chinese traveller who are banned from getting into Australia due to the outbreak of the prevailing virus. Other flights & hotels have the same non-refundable policy. However they did refund money to customers. It shows the characters of Jetstar. Booked two Jetstar flights via expedia. Didn't have any experience with Jetstar before. Will never deal with anything with Jetstar.,1
KUL-Yogyakarta. Easy access to LCCT airport by Skybus and other cheaper options from KL Sentral station. No hassles checking in - perhaps it was a quiet morning. Onboard clean newish Airbus with helpful young cabin crew. Food and drinks sold were very good and well priced especially the Nasi Chicken Biryani.,0
Day trip SIN-KUL on relatively new aircraft. Given the short distance AirAsia is definitely worth the value paid. Uses Terminal 1 at SIN but LCCT at KL is not the best.,0
"Denpasar to Jakarta with Lion Air was a terrible experience. The departure time from Denpasar was 18.15. At the time of check in at 17.15 I am told that flight is on time. Then at 1745 we are told that flight is 30 mins late, and finally the flight departs at 20.45. It landed at 21:50 and we were then left on tarmac for 30 minutes waiting for a bus to pick up and take us to the terminal.",1
I flew from Pune to Chennai economy class 12.00 noon flight. Friendly staff but bad food and very poor leg space compared to other airlines. Clean toilets staff are helpful and friendly. Will definitely fly with Indigo again.,0
"If you are thinking of flying to New Zealand using Qantas owned Jetstar, then think again! Read on to understand why. We flew into Auckland Airport, New Zealand on 3.12.22 with the intention to cycle tour around this beautiful country. Unfortunately our hold boxes containing our bicycles and everything else except our hand luggage, did not arrive at the same time. We were left with no option but to hire a car to get to our prepaid accommodation some 60km away. For 4 days we rang and emailed Jetstar. On each occasion we were told that they were still trying to locate our luggage. We were promised on numerous occasions that someone would call us back to give us an update. Annoyingly no call was ever received. With our travel plans totally disrupted, out of sheer frustration, we drove back to Auckland airport to discuss the matter face to face with the lost/delayed baggage department. After queuing for an hour with our angry folk trying to locate their luggage, we finally got to see someone. Eventually, they actually found our boxes whilst we waited. There must of been at least another 6 bike boxes in the lost luggage hall along with literally hundreds of suitcases. Who knows how long we would have been waiting for Jetstar to advise us that they actually had our luggage at Auckland airport. Days possibly weeks we suspect. Ours, is sadly not an isolated incident. Since then, we have sent email after email trying to recover the unbudgeted car hire costs we were forced to spend due to Jetstars inabilities. Jetstar flatly refuse to refund us these costs and insist that they will only cover the costs of the emergency toothpaste and brush we had to purchase. Needless to say that after our horrendous experience, we will never be flying with Qantas/Jetstar ever again!",1
"Nagpur to Pune. The flight got delayed by almost 2 hours. The flight time was 00.05 hrs to 01.10 hrs, the shops were almost closed. The staff didnt provide tea or coffee as it was so late hours and none of the shops were open. Very disappointed with this service. We were informed about the delay just 20 mins before boarding time.",1
"The Lion Air flight departed from Main Terminal, KLIA. Check in was simple. Boarding only started 10mins before ETD and was really slow. The Boeing 737-900ER used was old. The cabin crew was ok. The seat pitch is a minimum of 28"", and even for an Asian like me, I feel so uncomfortable throughout the flight which was about 2hrs. Lion is a budget, no-frills airline, thus, no IFE, no meals but a 20kg luggage allowance is provided free. Flight arrived 10mins behind schedule and it takes another 15mins for the aircraft ladder to arrive for disembarkation as Lion utilises the remote stand for cheaper airport charges. Once disembarked, waited for another 15mins for the transporting bus to arrive. Luckily luggage arrived fast. It was a terrible experience!",1
"MEL-HNL-MEL purchased an upgrade to the business class product on outbound. Did not expect anything like business class product on other international carriers so I was not disappointed with the product overall: it is closer to a premium economy product. Food was pretty good wines were fine very limited options on the free iPad but the noise-reducing headphones were great and no complaints about the amenities packet. However the leg room and recline were quite limited and the leg rest on my seat did not work. Chief FA looked at it and pronounced the cable broken ""like lots of these seats"" offered no regrets but pointed to 2 company non-revs in the bulkhead row and asked if I wanted her to go and roust them out so I could sit there. I felt very much put on the spot and declined. Miserable night. I suppose I should have been more assertive. On the inbound: execrable vegetarian food in economy and the seats also busted: no reading light no call bell no expression of regret from cabin staff (and this was an exit row seat for which I had paid extra). A332 on both flights very dirty and shabby. The toilets on both were simply disgusting even at the start of each flight. Many FAs wore dirty or tattered uniforms with buttons missing and frayed hems and cuffs. Of course the ticket was relatively cheap and Jetstar is now the only non-stop between MEL and HNL so one has to hold one's nose and endure. Slipshod rubbish airline even for an LCC.",1
"Manila to Singapore on Cebu Pacific's larger A330. Flight was busy and despite boarding on time the aircraft waited around the tarmac for 30 minutes due to usual Manila traffic. We arrived 30 mins late but that was more to do with Manila airport than Cebu Pacific. I was seated in row 3 which gives a bit extra legroom but being located toilet was bothersome. Flight was cheap and service was friendly and fun. Happy with the service and a fraction of the cost for the same service (minus a meal) compared with full service airlines. I also won a Cebu Pacific wash bag onboard the flight, quite a novelty!",0
"Having flown with Jetstar numerous occasions over many years it never fails to disappoint me. Why are they currently listing flights as being available on Webjet and when you go and book and pay for them you get confirmation. Then less than 12 hours later they cancel them! They then direct you to a 'chat with us' system that doesn't work and if you chose to get the voucher you still lose the Webjet booking fee and the voucher cannot be used to re-book the flight with Jetstar on another flight on the same day because it takes 2 weeks to issue. What they are trying to do is to get the travelling public to do their work by listing flights that they never intend to fly, letting people book, then cancelling the flights which force those people to re-book onto any remaining flights (usually Jetstar) and then because they can't use the voucher to re-book they are going to be forced to use this disgusting airline again within the next 12 months or lose their money. If I had any choice out of Hobart I would pay more not to use Jetstar. Is Webjet in cahoots with Jetstar on this, so it makes a booking fee on flights that are never going to fly?",1
Firstly they did not serve drinks prior (or even with) the meal - this service took place after dinner. Secondly they took so long to clear the dinner service that passengers were taking their trays to the galley themselves and stacking them in piles! Inflight entertainment is very expensive. Seats very uncomfortable and did not recline back far enough to be comfortable and allow sleep.,1
"JetStar was a nightmare of an experience for me, an older and not experienced traveler. I booked my flight early to coincide with a connecting flight from the US and back. Two weeks before flying I had to spend a week speaking with the airline because they changed my Australia flight to an earlier time. The only flight options they offered gave me a 14 or 17 hour layover in the airport. That was unacceptable to me and should be unacceptable to anyone. I researched myself and booked a less objectionable flight alternative. (I lost time with family and inconvenient to another family member to drive me to the airport (IN VALUABLE TIME). When i arrived at Melbourne airport at midnight there wasn't anywhere to sit for my 6 hour layover. Not a chair, I sat on a cold metal window sill. I had made it from the US with a carry on bag (3 flight changes) but Jetstar charged me an additional $65 at the gate because my bag was to big. I would never use them again. They were unsympathetic, unbendable and acted like their change in my flight was my problem and not theirs.",1
"Melbourne to Christchurch. This is the fourth time Im travelling with Jetstar, a round trip to Bali and another to Christchurch. Three flights had delays of 1 to 10 hours and the fourth which is the return to Melbourne from Christchurch got cancelled last minute and postponed to the day after and even then it got delayed for another hour. Very poor customer service. Will never book with them and recommend everyone else not to either, well its cheaper but isnt worth all delays and imagine getting cancelled as well and waiting at the airport for hours.",1
Recently flown with Jetstar to a number of destinations and can only offer praise for the ground staff and flight crew. I require special assistance and they made sure I received all the help I needed were friendly and efficient. The flight experience was a pleasure. The only drawback with Jetstar is the add-ons when you purchase your ticket. Add on baggage. Add on insurance. Add on donation. Add on seating allocation. Add on forward seats. Add on extra leg room. Add on carbon offset. And the worst is the booking fee they slug you with at the end which can be up to or more than $34. Ouch! Overall I would recommend Jetstar on the basis of good service for short haul flights. Just watch out for those extras.,0
"Jakarta to Singapore, 9 Oct 2918 the Jetstar Airways flight QF5204 was delayed for about 50 minutes due to computer problems. We finally departed Jakarta at about 4:00 pm local time and when we arrived Singapore, it already almost at 7:00 pm Singapore time. The crew didn't inform passengers at all about how we are going to catch our connecting flight to Sydney with 7:30 departure schedule. We were just instructed to go directly to Gate D46 from the arrival at Gate C24. It was quite far. My wife with her back problems and knee weakness have to follow me to run as quickly as we could. When we arrived at Gate D46 it was already closed. We were instructed to go to the transfer desk to take another flight which is QF2. It's good that we still have another flight. But why the crew with QF5204 didn't tell us about this once we exit the plane on Gate C24?  It was really a outright ignorant of Qantas. Even after I wrote the same complain in their website, till now I haven't received any response.",1
Brisbane to Denpasar. Didn't have high expectations flying Jetstar business but  that has changed. Check in at Brisbane was fast as separate check in for business class passengers and priority boarding. Cabin had 21 seats in 2x3x2 configuration I sat in seat 2A. Was welcomed by the cabin crew manager with a glass of champagne. Menus were given and orders taken. Selection of 3 meals I chose omelette which was delicious. Seat width and recline was great for my 6 hour flight and the entertainment was easy to use and had a great selection of content. I would fly business class with Jetstar again and the price was great.,0
Late both legs. About an hour outbound and almost 2 hours inbound. This happens every time I go with AirAsia. What annoyed me was we were told the flight was on-time but only at boarding time were we told the flight would be an hour late. However it seemed to be more like 2 hours.  If you want to do certain routes like Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur there are no feasible alternatives to AirAsia.,1
"Chennai to Raipur via Hyderabad. Indigo is being quite careless these days, they mess up things and all we get to hear is ""sorry for the inconvenience mam"". Recently While booking the tickets i had selected a XL seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance, but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the XL seats including my father's, so today when we went to get our boarding passes, they said sorry mam, all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is, you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money. Its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through. Why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people can't handle it properly.",0
"I flew to Kuala Lumpur and back and hated both flights. I'm 6 foot tall, and I usually go in a window seat and I am fine. I was on the aisle seat for both flights and found my legs crammed in. My seat wouldn't recline and found it impossible to find a comfortable position. The plane was too cold, I shivered on the plane and can only be grateful I wasn't allocated a middle or window seat. If you are over 6 feet, 183cm tall, don't expect a pleasant experience. Only good thing was the staff were absolutely fine.",1
"Flew Johor to Kuala Lumpur. Flight delayed 3 hours 25 mins. No advance notice given the day before. Very bad experience with AirAsia, poor service, not recommended. No compensation offered on flight delayed.",1
Used Jetstar from Bangkok to Singapore 4x in the last 3 months and everything went like clock work. Online reservations easy and rates better than competition especially last moment purchase check in a breeze new clean planes and great crew comfortable seating with actual leg room. All flights on time and all landed ahead of schedule. Definitely will use them and prefer them to others like AirAsia that is becoming a true cattle mover.,0
"MNL-BKK-MNL in this beautiful single-aisle aircraft. MNL to BKK was on time while the return was delayed for about an hour which by fine by me. Pre-ordered meal was OK, the usual bland airline meal. Was able to win in one of their fun games. All in all it was good flight by Cebu Pacific.",1
KUL-MNL-KUL. The airport where Air Asia international flights depart is supposed to be a domestic airport. My flight was at 4.20pm. I arrived at the airport around 1.30pm. Past 2pm they were not still letting us in. The waiting area and check in area is still serving the earlier flight to Korea. They just have 2 check in counters and 2 immigration counters of a supposed to be international terminal. I am from the Philippines and I feel for the foreigners who were with me on this terminal. I hope Air Asia can transfer all of their international flights to Terminal 3. Will take Air Asia to Manila once they transfer.,1
"Jakarta to Tarakan. Late Is Our Name is what Indonesians I've met call Lion Air. They claim a 70% on time performance score. I fly on them at least once or twice a month because I usually have no other option (like it or not, they have flights to more places than anyone else). How is it that easily 75% of the time I am in the 30% of flights that are late? They invariably claim operational reasons are behind the delays. What this often means is that they give the plane that was scheduled for your flight to another flight that was delayed. That way they can get away with giving passengers some bottled water and a bun for your 2-hour delay instead of forking over Rp.400000 to each passenger who would have been delayed for 4 hours on the other flight (as required by Indonesia's Passengers Bill of Rights law). Before serious penalties are incurred, they will then give someone else's airplane to your flight so that they won't have to pay you any money either. And these switches continue at that airport for hours until they get caught up or the day is finally over.",1
"Flew from Tokyo (Narita) to Melbourne. Check-in opened 3 hours before departure, but there was already a long queue. It was still a half hour wait to be checked in. Staff however were efficient and polite. Boarding was completed ahead of time but the flight still departed nearly ten minutes late. But that is punctual for Jetstar so I can't complain. The economy seat was not comfortable but acceptable, except the IFE was not operating. I hadn't included it in my options but I did need to charge my iPhone and iPad so I could continue to access my own 'entertainment package'. But the USB port was not functioning either. I mentioned it to staff after a couple of hours (the batteries were flat). Staff offered to relocate me to a seat where the IFE worked and also offered complimentary access to the IFE to compensate for the inconvenience. Sensible and polite. That's a tick. I brought my own picnic lunch/dinner - 2 boiled eggs, 2 rolls, 3 onigiri (Japanese rice balls), some fruit and a bottle of water purchased in the boarding area. This was fortuitous as the offered fried rice/noodles options looked OK but pedestrian whereas my little 'picnic' meals were appetising and delicious. It's another tick for Jetstar that they make meals optional and allow you to bring your own. For a cost conscious traveller, Jetstar is now OK (delays notwithstanding). It's spartan but by preparing your own entertainment and meals ahead of the flight, you can make it much more pleasant.",0
Our flight was unfortunately cancelled yesterday (Sunday) 15 min prior to boarding. There was a lot of confusion and to how to reach our destination. Ms Dhara at the airline counter in Mumbai was extremely helpful and guided us through. Not only that she was calm and composed but she knew every step of what she was doing and tried her level best to put us on the next flight and gave us instruction with clarity. Mr. Adhil also extended his help since we had to catch our next scheduled flight from international terminal,0
"Gold Coast to Kaohsiung via Singapore. Low cost airline? I think not! Price: It seemed to be a low cost option at the time of looking for our flight. Ultimately it was not cheap. Considering how long the trip was with long layovers in Singapore. However, still had to contend with the limited options of a low cost airline. The online booking process has many stages of options that one needs to wade through. The tally keeps growing until one reaches the end with a bill the size of one from a more comfortable airline. This is the only airline I've come across that offers  nothing included free. Baggage: We were travelling for one month so chose to add 20KG. Pleasingly they do include 10kg carry on. Scheduling: They arrived on time and left late due to no fault of their own they tell us. The thing we're really fed up about is the forced long wait at Changi. Three times this has been a feature of our flight. There never seems to be any short layovers. Of course this may just be the legs we are flying. Both legs of this trip required long (20-22 hours) waits at Changi. We spend $200-$300 each leg just trying to have a place to rest and eat. Again contributing to false economy. Food: In flight options are not clear for a person with food intolerances like myself. No food labelling. Not even water is provided free. What you do pay for is shockingly small for the amount of money you pay. Staff were not particularly friendly, though not unfriendly they just didn't seem to care much. Would we choose them again? Not likely.",1
Business Class from Denpasar to Sydney was a total waste of money. My husband had a fixed metal box between his feet Seat 2G and had to sit at an angle to stretch his legs. The footrest was of no value whatsoever. The so called 'touch' screen required a hard tap to operate and I felt every selection the passenger behind me made. He also had long legs and therefore I couldn't recline my seat as far as I wanted. The flight departed at 10.30pm and was scheduled to take just over 5 hrs. The first hour of the flight was taken up with Business Class passengers eating their 'free' meal. The small window of opportunity to sleep was reduced. The toilet was Out of Order from the start of the flight. We fly Economy Jetstar regularly and have low expectations high satisfaction. But to pay extra for this Business Class flight our expectations were higher and not met. So disappointing.,1
"Jakarta to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala Lumpur. We've been on Air Asia and its subsidiaries a few times, mostly enjoyable, no nonsense and good value for money, so was this flight. One unpleasant experience on this particular flights; we were separated between KUL-SGN due to full flight - apparently and was advised to see ground staff at transfer desk KLIA2, where there was no help. We went to the boarding gate and they gave us 31B/31 C at the back of the plane. Once onboard, it wasn't a full flight, there are plenty of seats available. AirAsia system obviously cannot see that it was a single booking for two pax, hence they do not allocate seats for two.",1
Great job guys on Coolangatta to Melbourne flight at 7.30. Our stewardess was great and made the flight really enjoyable. Keep up good work and keep your great sense of humour. If all cabin staff are like you Ill be with you guys no problem.,0
"Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. Do not use this company. My flight was cancelled for Covid 19 in April, and they will not refund for flights they cancelled and the insurance they provide does not cover this either.",1
Night flight from DMK-KUL last week and the flight was delayed 45 minutes. This week my friends took flight to SIN and CGK (both were from KUL) and both flights were delayed for 45 and 40 minutes. They had to pay midnight charges on their return trip from the airports not to mention the normal hassle when you got delayed.,1
Flew from Mumbai to Bhubaneswar with IndiGo. The flight arrived and departed on time. The interior is also well maintained and the seats are quite comfortable. The cabin crew are very polite and listens to one's problem very patiently. The landing was a smooth one and the pilot kept us well-informed about the delays. The food was delicious and it was a very enjoyable flight. I will have a pleasure flying with IndiGo again.,0
Bangalore to Mumbai. Worst ever experience. No professionalism. Postponing flights and after that also nothing on time. I would never again go by this flight. Why do they write even for departure when they are never going to follow it. So much inconvenience.,1
We flew Honolulu to Brisbane on May 21st the flight left on time Business class cabin was full but very comfortable. Service with a smile from a young energetic flight crew. The flight was seamless the food was served well and hot totally edible. Seats were very comfortable not massive legroom but ample toilets were kept clean and fresh we arrived on time in Brisbane. It may not compare to some other Business Class offered on other airlines however for us it was value for money and we travelled in comfort the daylight flight did not cause us to have bad jetlag we would surely fly with them again on this route. Your only grumble could be the inflight entertainment which could be clumsy when eating I chose to read and sleep.,0
"Having checked online for Yangon to Bangkok it just remained to have documents checked at the appropriate desk. 50 minutes later still waiting. They allowed passengers with checked luggage to use the same line and then a tour group had problems with documentation. Instead of asking them to stand aside to fill in the documents they let them block the line. The supervisor said ""you could have joined another line"" - yes at the back again!",1
"I am extremely satisfied with Indigo's service. I was visiting my daughter in USA and had a transit in Delhi via Agartala. I was extremely nervous as I am a senior citizen and my previous booking with Vistara for the same destination was suddenly cancelled. Indigo was extremely courteous and helped me every step of the way. Not only did the staff help in Agartala, Kolkata and Delhi but a young gentleman from their airline stayed and helped me out in Delhi when my flight to USA was delayed. I am forever grateful to this gentleman to provide such service during this pandemic situation.",0
"Flew AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to Bali return. Both flights with a 2 hour delay, on the second one I almost lost my long haul flight, even though I had allowed 4 hours between flights. Boarding was chaotic. My advice, dont fly with AirAsia if you have a connecting flight, or fly a day before.",1
"Chengdu to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Most ridiculous flight I've ever experienced. Flying with two adults, an infant on lap and a two year old child. At airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination, but couldn't print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. Eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us. Will not be flying Air Asia again, am amazed that their policy of two year olds sitting on their own is even legal.",1
I flew from Darwin to Bali on 21 April and from Bali to Darwin on 25 April. That was our first time trying Air Asia and we will not try again. On both days Air Asia was delayed for about 2 hour. There would have been no time to have the crew check the plane before it departed again.,1
"Sydney to Bangalore via Singapore. I picked this flight solely because departure from Sydney was at 1.30 pm, layover at Singapore was 2.50 hrs then arrival at Bangalore would be 10.55pm the same night - they delayed my flight at last moment and mailed that information to me at about 11.30 pm the night before departure, so late i couldn't make any alternate arrangements. The delay was 2.0 hrs long - if it was 3 hrs or more the airline would have to issue every passenger a $50 voucher - however flight landed at Singapore 2 hrs later than scheduled. Before boarding the staff at Sydney airport promised me that my connecting flight and stay arrangements would be sorted once I met the staff at Singapore - my connecting flight had left 2 hrs before I landed, staff was overtly rude. They patched me up with a much cheaper flight which would leave 8 hrs later (overnight stay) - upon asking about the accommodation , they asked me to lay around at the airport. Biggest lesson of my life - never ignore the reviews about airlines before booking flights.",1
"Flew AirAsia on AK702 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was on time and I got to sit the TuneTalk livery jet. Boarding process was smooth, seat was comfortable and the cabin crews were helpful. Refreshments are available for sale at decent price. Even though my flight was completely full, the cabin crews managed to serve every passenger well.",0
Lombok to Jakarta. The worst airline I have ever have had the misfortune of using. Since moving to Indonesia at the beginning of the year I have used Lion Air 5 times. Each time I have been delayed at least 1 hour. Its a complete normal thing for them. Avoid at all costs and pay the extra money to fly Garuda.,1
Flew SIN-TPE on 21st December the plane cabin actually looked rather old and dated. A panel at the ceiling of the cabin seemed to be loose too. Seats were hard and uncomfortable this was made worse by the lack of a headrest. However the recline of the seat was outstanding. Throughout the 4 hour flight the call buttons were ringing non-stop making any sleep impossible. The call button is placed right beside the armrest so almost everyone accidentally pressed it. Cabin was also rather cold. Toilets are clean and there are drinking fountains outside toilets too. As for service the service crew was very unprofessional they did their work without any smiles and all seemed very cold.,1
"This is for the last time I will fly with Indigo. I had to ask for water (forget anything else), forget choosing free seats. The lights were very dim, making reading impossible. Last time in November 2021 I flew with Indigo from Mumbai to Kolkata. I booked about 20 days or so in advance. Thrice my flight was rescheduled and I had to change my entire programme. I paid extra for a window seat.",1
"Every single flight in the past 2 weeks had some sort of issue. Flight #1 KUL-SUB - last moment rescheduled 2.5 hours later, departed 1hr late. Total delay 3.5hrs. Flight #2 SUB-UPG - departed 1hr late. Flight #3 UPG-AMQ cancelled. rebooked to earlier flight Flight #4 AMQ-SXK last moment rescheduled to 2 hours later - aborted landing, ok touchdown on second attempt. Flight #5 KNG-SOQ departed on schedule, aborted landing, ok touchdown on second attempt. Flight #6 SOQ-UPG cancelled, rebooked to flight next day In summary: 6 out of 6 booked flights had some issue. 1 extra overnight required in Sorong (Lion Air not providing a hotel)",1
We flew Christchurch to KL return and KL to Kota Bharu return. We found them very good. All flights were on time. The service was good. The food and beverages were reasonably priced and tasty. I would recommend due to the good value.,0
Took a long week end to fly from Singapore to Gold Coast. Because my companion is a big guy we took one Super Seat and one standard Seat. Both are aisle seats. Turns out there is not much difference. As we departed at 10.30pm we expected to have a nap within the 7-hour flight. Since the plane adopts a 3-4-3 seating plan the aisles are extremely narrow. Every time the trolley came by the flight attendant shoved my arm and woke me up. The passenger next to me was a tall guy whose elbow kept poking my other arm. Despite this we may still fly them again and low price is the main reason.,0
16/5/15 JQ785 ADL-MEL Airbus A320. Again another very good flight with Jetstar. Welcomed aboard by friendly and helpful cabin crew. Flight attendants looked professional and lovely. Nice uniforms. Excellent professional conduct by cabin crew. Aircraft was clean. We had seat 17E & 17D seats were comfortable. Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags. I have not come across this on a Jetstar flight in the past. Overall a very good flight and this is a very good low cost carrier. Would recommend to others but will warn them of these new changes.,0
"Banjarmasin to Jakarta. I am happy because they use Boeing 737 MAX which more spacious legroom, comfort seat and less noise. Service is okay for no frill airlines. They give snack and drink because one hour delay. Good service from ground service with 20 kg free baggage and good service from flight attendant.",0
Perth to Denpasar. Have travelled with on previous occasions but this was different. Started with being charged $400+ AUD one way then $100.00 AUD for 6 kg excess baggage and then the issue of the lady at counter laughing at me in front of other customers at check in. When asked what was amusing just continued. Was not funny at time as found charge to be excessive. Not professional either. The new seats not bad but still no room for the extra paid. All round not happy. Why is it so expensive to leave Australia but to get back is 1/3 of the price. Getting ripped off maybe.,1
Traveling from Melbourne to Bali. Receive a text at 11:00pm that the flight is canceled. Shocking. Gave an alternative flight which was longer via Sydney. Totally no consideration of your clients. Very unfortunate company. Quite surprised that it is still open. In queue with 200 people as online check in closed and to top it all they do not have machines for checkin either like all other airlines.,1
"Iloilo to General Santos. I booked this ticket last February and did not purchase any seat then. When I checked in online through the Cebu Pacific app, I was charged with a seat I supposedly purchased. I called and asked when I purchased it. It was the same time I checked in online. Now if I want to cancel it, I could. But I have to pay the same amount as spoilage fee! This is madness and unfair. I would like to say I will not fly Cebu Pacific again but this is the only airline operating this route. I feel robbed.",1
"In short an incompetent and very poorly run airline. We caught 4 different flights with air Asia and only 1 ran on time. Delay after delay, said were boarding was at 10.20pm to still not being boarded at 11.15. Booked all my travel with my partner, requested to be seated together. When checking in not sitting together so I had to fork out $100 to choose new seats to sit together, after doing that on our last flight back to Sydney we find out AirAsia have moved our seats again and we are not sitting together. Disgustingly poor form.",1
"I was disappointed with the delay, flight was 30 minutes delayed while going from Sharjah to Trivandrum and a one hour delay on return to Sharjah. I booked Indigo for an on time flight but its a false image. Worst experience, airline didn't even inform us about the delay through an SMS or any other means. Waste of time. Attitude of crew is the worst. They should learn to respect passengers.",1
All sectors over 3 hours late. Not allowed to bring water on board. Airline serves water from the plane tanks. Food absolutely disgusting - butter chicken at 0600 am. Cold coffee. Toilets filthy. Crew miserable. Unable to move to free seats. When did flying become so bad its like riding a public bus. No longer low price when you add all the extras and I bought the max package however to change would have cost - the same price again (double the original fare) to change.,1
"CGK to UPG on June 17th 2012. Booking was good. It was an average experience yes the plane was good (737-900ER with Boeing sky interior) seat pitch was okay. I have no issue with the ""no f&b flight"". It was the worst landing I've experienced. On the return flight on board the older 737-900ER seat pitch was poor and the landing was just the same as before.",1
"Manila to General Santos, unfortunately, I travelled 6 times with Cebu Pacific this summer and all flights have been almost 4 hours late. No apologies and no action from the airline. Today, the flight time was meant to be 10.00am and no one can tell us how long will be waiting time. They told us the plane will be ready at 11.25, now already telling us that it is expected to reach the terminal at 12.45.",1
Numerous flights REP-KUL KUL-HKT HKT-KUL KUL-SGN. Experiences differ at each airport but check-in and boarding was smooth. Nice leather seats and although not a lot not bare minimum legroom. Good selection of food and drink (which was very cheap). The satay chicken was quite oily however the tandoori chicken wraps were nice. Every flight was on-time if not early. The Kuala Lumpur LCCT is a bit old and grubby but then again you do have to expect that when travelling low-cost.,0
"I've made a reservation on Jetstar from SIN-TPE on 11/6/18, 1.10am. 13/9/18  Received email notification from Jetstar on flight delay to 9.55am. Contact Jetstar via live Chat to reconfirm details. Proceed to reschedule all the arrangement, paid penalty for hotel and tour amendments. 17/9/18 Received email reminder for the flight to TPE. Noticed the flight timing indicated as 1.10am (no notification was received on the change of flight timing). Called Jetstar Hotline to reconfirm on flight timing. Call centre was not sure of the timing. Throughout the 30min conversation, the agent told me 3 different timing for my flight and finally confirmed that it is changed back to 1.10am. Again, I proceed to reschedule all the travel arrangement and paid for amendments fees. 18/9/18, 10 hours before the flight, received an SMS notification that flight was delayed to 9.55am. Called hotline again and the 1hr 30min calls was hell. Spoke to 2 different agent and non was sure on the exact timing. First told me it's changed to 9.55am, and next moment tell me there's no change and the flight is at 1.10am. As of now, I am not even sure if the trip will happen as promised. Not sure if it'll suddenly change to 1.10am again and I am not being informed. It's true that the t&c for budget airline mentioned that it's subject to changes, but 3 changes for a flight is too much when there's no natural disaster whatsoever. The call centre advised me that it's simply due to ""operational requirement"". Customer have to suffer because of their changes in ""operational requirement"", Don't ever book Jetstar again!",1
I was not even given water after repeated requests and was finally told that I have to pay. I paid for international travel that includes food. The crew told me that they dont have a contract with Qatar which is not true. The crew need better training. Another time I was traveling from Ahmadabad to Hyderabad sitting in the front row of the flight. By the time I arrived I was bitten by several mosquitos. The DGCA need to take stringent action. I have promised myself not to fly Indigo again.,1
"Queenstown to Auckland - the downside to flying Jetstar from Queenstown is the 40 min wait in line to check-in. Then to be told your flight is delayed by over an hour and I'm not sure we were told the actual reason for the delay. Don't get me wrong I know these are ""first world problems"" but if Jetstar want to be a contender with AirNZ on more than just price they need to do way way better in this area. The staff were friendly enough and the queue was not actually that long, but without having self check-in facilities, having on average just 2 staff check people in was not enough. In comparison, all the AirNZ / Virgin Australia check-ins operating (about 6 or so) and they have self service check-ins - hence no real queue there. Therefore my rating for Jetstar, and Qantas for that matter, for check-in service out of Queenstown is 1/10. While I can't rate the delayed flight home at this point, on balance, everything about the flight to Queenstown from Auckland was great. Easy check-in, no delays and comfortable enough flight (although we were lucky and had 6 seats between the 4 of us) on which the crew were great. So 9/10 for that part of the trip. Overall I'll rate my Jetstar experience so far 5/10 and I would recommend them to friends and family but it will come with a warning that you generally get what you pay for.",0
"My friend and I decided to go Kuala Lumpur from Singapore for the new year. We paid more the S$200 for a return air ticket for each of us. We were to fly on 31 December to KL and return on 3 Jan 2016 (peak season, off peak the ticket is less than S$50 each way). On 28 December 2015, Airasia wrote to us that our flight on 3 Jan 2016 was cancelled and rescheduled to fly on 5 Jan 2016. When I went online to check, there were agents selling tickets to return on 3 Jan 2106 on AirAsia but the tickets were nearly S$200 one way. I went into the Airasia website to have an online chat. Waited an hour before the operator repeated that the flight was cancelled but I told him there were other agents selling the ticket. He repeated the instructions of the email. I had also bought my hotel accommodations from Airasia and asked if I could cancel the entire trip. The operator could only cancel my flight and my hotel booking cannot be cancelled (my hotel cost more than the flight)! I asked what if I want to come back on the 3 Jan because my friend cannot apply for any leave. I was basically told that was my problem. Left without any real options, I requested a refund for my flights back from KL. My friend bought a new ticket from SQ returning on 2 Jan for less than S$100 and I return on 5 Jan for a ticket that was less than S$50. AirAsia gave us an option to fly back on the 5 Jan 2015 (the ticket cost less than S$50). I asked if I flew back on the 5 Jan 2015 with Airasia, would I receive a refund of the difference. The answer was no.",1
Flew on their new route MNL-SYD. As this is a low cost carrier you get what you pay for. There are no blankets pillows complimentary food and drinks or Inflight Entertainment. However the website was easy to navigate when making bookings the aircraft was clean cabin crew were friendly lavatories spotless throughout the flight and the flight was on time. Inflight entertainment consisted of complimentary wi-fi with movie and magazine choices for viewing. You need your own wi-fi enabled device to use the service. Internet access was also available for USD12.00 for the flight. The wi-fi service was stable and reliable. If all you are seeking is a cheap seat Cebu Pacific is the way to go. The fare cost AUD150.00. A competing carrier was offering a fare of AUD700.00. A nice touch was entering the aircraft into the cabin not via a galley which is standard of most aircraft designs. Entering directly into the cabin creates the impression of more space. The configuration of the Cebu Pacific A330-200 is tight with only 8 lavatories. However the cabin is all one class of service and there were no queuing issues with lavatories. Will fly them again for the cheap ticket cost and friendly service.,0
"The cabin of the aircraft was clean and well-maintained. The seats were comfortable enough for the duration of the flight, but legroom was modest I found it difficult to stretch my legs. There is no in-flight entertainment system. The pre-booked meal was tasty. Overall satisfied but need some constant improvement.",0
I passed out for hour due to lack of oxygen an hour into the flight. I can't think the Jetstar Airways crew enough for helping me. They were like nurses and I commend them for their professionalism.,0
"Singapore to Manila. The flight I never had, due to the Taal volcano eruption I decided the day before to cancel my flight. I had purchased a meal and an extra seat for more space. I was told sorry no rebooking and no refund - nothing so sorry. The Scoot call centre was obviously trained to say sorry and nothing else and offered no more information. To add insult to injury they would not even refund my meal which I never received same with my over $100 extra seating. I have low expectations for budget airlines but this was plain robbery.  I will never fly them again.",1
"AirAsia is a budget airline. They seem to do ok once its a given that your flight will occur. My biggest complaint with them is that they constantly are changing their schedule, withdrawing flights, changing times of them etc. Out of the 12 flights I had booked with them over half were changed, some by many hours even to different days. This makes scheduling with them extremely difficult. This flight was ok, and originally a nonstop to KUL. But had to waist 3/4 of a day getting to KUL with a stopover in DMK for this flight. Seats are tiny and squished together. Thats what you get for a cheap price. Cant fault them for that. Just hate their non reliability of any flight booked more than a week out.",1
"Had a need to clarify my wife's (and infant) portion of our booking. I called the support line to ask about what can be done within the scope of our ticket. I spoke with one of the most proactive and helpful people I could have hoped for. To my surprise, she had provided me with options to save me a substantial portion of money. I was really thankful for this and to Scoot for acknowledging things change in peoples lives and being able to accommodate this.",0
JQ038 to Bali and Back. The seats were awful. They are so tight once the person in front reclines you have to recline your seat. We paid for all the extras the food was very limited so we had to buy food anyway they forgot our comfort pack and in fact we found later into the flight they gave it to someone else who hadn't paid for it. The entertainment was very limited and the sound quality was terrible. The staff were non existent and inattentive.,1
Sydney-Darwin red eye flight. Paid for exit row seats which were worth it for the extra leg room. Staff were kind and the flight landed on time so no complaints aside from the annoyance that the head rests aren't adjustable.,0
"This the worst airline ever. Upon checking in at the counter, we have realized that our check in baggage of 23kg is for per piece instead of the total weight. We were asked to top up for the additional luggage that we have. The seats were very stiff and uncomfortable as well.",1
For my flight they were checking our carry on bags just before the aircraft entrance and asking for $60 because mine were more than 7 combined with laptop bag. I have made sure my carry on bag is no more than 7 kilos but if it is to combined with my laptop bag then my laptop itself weighs nore than 3 kilos. I work for the airports and travel a lot but never seen any airlines find so cheeky way to get the money. I am shocked!,1
Booked KUL-CGK route back in January 24th. Been flying with this airline numerous times before but this was the first international flight. A few hours before my flight I decided to reschedule to Jan 25th due to some inevitable matters in KL then I tried to call the local customer centre number. I managed to reschedule without much hassles certainly with some additional fees (to be paid at the airport). The following day I checked in at Lion Air kiosk in the airport paid the fees and got my boarding pass. It is evidently cheaper than the infamous low-cost carrier Air Asia in some routes. Also worth noting that being a low cost carrier in KUL Lion Air - unlike Air Asia and several others - remains a few (if not the only one) of its kind to land in KLIA satellite terminal (NOT LCCT) means it is accessible more conveniently from KL City Centre.,0
Best airline ever. Great customer service. Pleasant staff. Super impressed. I was traveling with baby and toddler. They went above and beyond. I have been living in US and no airline was close to this.,0
Business class JQ47 from BNE to Bali. We had to walk from the airport building along the runway to the plane on the scorching sun. Flight was delayed more than hour due to wrong meals being loaded. Business class seats are total disaster more like premium economy. Touch screen is worse than any screen in economy class on any other airline. It was freezing cold during the flight. On my way back from Bali to BNE I spent few hours in the Premier Lounge which was hardly better than average pub in BNE. Walking back again from the plane to the building in BNE. Never again Jetstar.,1
Booked and confirmed to travel BNE-CNS-NRT 27 August 2014 and NRT-CNS-BNE 09 Septermber 2014. Jetstar cancelled the flight 27 August and without consultation re-booked us to travel 29 August. After requesting what other options were available a flight on 26 August was offered. Since we had accommodation sightseeing and a cruise confirmed 29 and 26 August were not acceptable to us. Knowing that Jetstar operated out of the Gold Coast I requested that we be transferred to fly OOL-NRT 29 August. The inflight crew on the outbound flight were mostly foreign and very professional and friendly. Food service was OK. On the return flight the food was inedible. The aircraft operating this service is the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The only dream we had was to be able to get out of our seats. Once the seats in front were reclined it was impossible to get out. The recline came back to the level of the armrest preventing one to stand up. The only way to exit the seat is to swing ones legs over the armrest into the aisle. If sitting in the centre of three one has to be dragged out.,1
"Denpasar to Melbourne. Did not bother to let us know until check in time was almost finished. No offer to assist pregnant sick wife and baby!  Will chose another airline next time. Last time i used jetstar they canceled the flight altogether but only after we were already onboard waiting in the heat with no aircon in Singapore. That time was the same, no caring, terrible customer service.",1
"Flew Christchurch to Sydney. Really really cramped, this is a new low even for Jetstar economy. You have to sit up completely straight to avoid knocking your knees on the seat in front. Food tray hits your stomach and I am average weight. Hello Jetstar I'm not a sardine! Don't bother thinking you might get a cup of tea, $4.00 for a cup of hot water and a tea bag, just low.",1
At 9.45pm last night I got the dreaded email from Jetstar saying my flight is cancelled for today. I clicked options but only got message to check with ground staff at the airport if I was at the airport. Or call Jetstar but the call centre is not open for another 8 hours. I checked Jetstar flights leaving Phuket for Melbourne for the next 3 days but all sold out. Once again left stranded overseas with no information. I got cancelled last year by Jetstar going to Bali. I booked a flight with another airline for $1800 rather than risk of being stranded. Shame on you Jetstar. The least you could do is have call centre open for stranded international passengers. Complete lack of information.  Plenty of other airlines who will do the right thing.,1
Our initial flight from Bangkok to Singapore was delayed 4 hours. This of course is fine and expected with budget airlines. However we had a connecting flight from Singapore. The staff at Bangkok airport told us that it was ok because the connecting flight would wait for us hence we didn't make any arrangements (eg book a hotel or another flight). However when arriving at Singapore at 2am we were told the flight had left and that we would have to wait until 2am the next morning. We were also told that we had to check in 10 hours before our next flight to guarantee a seat. Ground staff explained if we wanted to we could book another flight and receive a full refund for our Singapore to Sydney leg. Many passengers did and did not receive the refund.,1
"Flew from Melbourne to Singapore. Scoot are the budget of the budget. The staff are unfriendly and incompetent. The plane we took had the least legroom of a plane I've ever been on and being 187cm I was in serious discomfort/pain the whole flight. They do not have drinking water available (except to buy at extortionate prices) and even told us ""no outside food can be eaten on the plane"". This isn't written down anywhere and I'm not sure that's even legal? Avoid.",1
Balikpapan-Manado 18 July 2012. New Fleet B737-800ER nice interior. Departure and arrival was on time. The service was standard. I always choose a seat near emergency door. Cabin crew handling was nice.,0
"Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, no comments. The flight was relatively smooth. No glitches. Services was good. Cabin staff crew were polite and overall had a smooth relaxing trip with AirAsia .",0
MNL-TPE on Flight 5J312. Snagged a promotional fare which kept the cost of this flight very low even after adding extra for baggage etc. Polite cabin crew prompt and patient with passenger requests. Seat comfort was adequate for the short flight (2 hours) but probably not for a longer route. IFE nonexistent (unless you count the in-house magazine and the infamous onboard games). Food not bad but hideously overpriced better save your money for a meal at the airport. Arrived on time. Will fly with Cebu Pacific again on this route if I can get cheap seats during a sale.,0
"Flight was cancelled more than 2 weeks prior to departure for ""Operational reasons"". Attempted to secure a refund but it took over 2 weeks just to get a response. AirAsia, decided that, rather than a 5 hour transit, an alternative flight a day later with around 15 hours of travel was a sufficient substitute. Over 3 weeks later and I am still waiting to understand if I will receive a refund. Will never book with AirAsia again.",1
"Auckland to Nelson. Have heard bad things about them, but it was ok for me. I usualy fly Air New Zealand on the AKL-NSN route but I saw a Jetstar ad and opted to fly with them for $150pp return which is cheap because air nz charge up to $150pp one way!  I chose the early 6:05 am flight which meant waking up at 4 am. Arrived late to the airport and we could not find the gate (62) because at Auckland it is a small building separate from the main domestic terminal and was poorly labelled. the aircraft was remotely parked we had to get on a single small, crowded and sweaty bus to the aircraft. Boarding was a mess, a mad rush to get on the plane. upon entry the flight attendant did not check our boarding passes?, I had an e-ticket. we were met by a strong wet dog-like musty odour inside the cabin. The seats were 'well used' and had no guts left, the tray tables were marked and scuffed but lots of legroom, my overhead panel was not working. but all this is to be expected from a 15.5-year-old aircraft. during the safety briefing the flight attendant apologised and said this was the aircraft's first flight of the day so the pilots would be performing engine tests. After a quick takeoff, the pilot anounced that due to 'airspace restrictions' we were going to fly out over the Pacific ocean and loop back into Nelson. the rest of the flight was uneventful no free cabin service though, final was turbulent, the landing was slightly rough. The new terminal at Nelson tops it all off nicely.",0
"Scoot Biz is not business class that's what I learned on the flight to Hong Kong but why? 1) Seats in Scoot Biz are nothing more than cheap Premium Economy seats made out of synthetic leather and plastic. The adjustment of backrest and footrest is very sluggish. 2) Food on my Scoot flight was inadequate, it was like a 1$ meal from Walmart. 3) You don't get pillows and blankets (you buy it). 4) You have no IFE in the whole plane, but the WIFI is very cheap.",1
"Kalibo to Manila. Worst airline experience. Delays can last as long as 8-hours with no meals. If complaints are filed whether online or written, you will only get an electronic reply and won't hear from them ever after. Fare is cheap so don't expect a responsible service.",1
"For the first time ever after around 50 years of flying my baggage got lost. After insisting some staff were worried enough to deal with me as a European on a domestic flight. After 3 hours and 6 different employees I finally got a ridiculous pink copy of a handwritten report - like 50 years ago. In my hotel I wasted 2 hours trying to chat with them to find out if my loss has been registered - and jumped from position 550 to 26, then back to 3xx, back and forth, meaningless. After calling them a robot's voice sounded like a scifi-movie from the 50s, useless again. So far Indigo acts inhuman, without any empathy for my loss. They do not care. Who is interested in seat comfort when the baggage gets lost and nobody at Indigo cares?",1
"When choosing a budge airline, we definitely begin with some low expectation. With Scoot, you got to expect even lower, then lower it again on the Singapore to Zhengzhou route. At Singapore Changi Airport, Scoot Check-in is not automatic. They definitely make sure to make everyone pay for the extra kg on their hand luggage, not at the counter, but with separate crew/staff who buzzes around each and everyone of you to make you pay. So be careful, weigh your luggage and make sure it is below 10kg. The seats are close together, tight. Surprisingly, at Zhengzhou Xinzheng Airport, Scoot counter is very friendly and up-to-standard. This was not expected at all. The ground staff is professional and helpful. For budget travelers in the early morning or mid-night scene, it could say a lot about local hospitality. In the end, Scoot costs not less than other airlines. I will get back to China Southern, or Xiamen Airline. Scoot no more!",1
"Bangalore to Nagpur with IndiGo. On this trip to India, I was fortunate enough to try 3 different airlines - Air India, Jet Airways and Indigo. Indigo definitely scored best in terms of its modern fleet, however not recommended for international passengers due to its baggage restrictions. The fares aren't that cheap compared to other airlines, however Air India allows the most baggage weight. The staff are young and attractive, but truly inexperienced to handle situations. Personally didn't have a choice, since IndiGo had so many direct flights to remote cities.",0
"I flew from Sydney to Bali. The seats are uncomfortable the inflight entertainment screen was too close and of a poor selection the seating / leg room was uncomfortably small (I am only 62 kgs and 1.67 tall ). On flight back from Bali to Sydney the air con was blowing icy cold air onto my neck and when I requested a blanket I was told that I did not choose the ""pamper Pack"" at $10 I did not want pampering but just protect myself from this cold blast. Too much take and no give with this airline. The cabin crew were not accommodating at all. I do fly to Bali once or twice a year and this was my first JetStar flight to that destination never again. They are ok for short flights within Australia but do not have the class for passengers to endure a longer trip.",1
"More delays. Consistently rescheduling flights, no notification to phone or email. Seat configuration minimum distance. Total disregard for passengers. A disgraceful airline one of the worst. Customer service virtually non existent.",1
"Surabaya to Jakarta with Lion Air. 12 hours before, I already check in on Lion Air website check in. I already selected the seat then I chose aisle seat - at the boarding time I didn't get my selected seat! If Lion Air can check in on website 12 hours before flight, why didn't I get my selection seat? Other people who did not check-in on website (the other people check in 2hours before flight) got my seat! Lion Air is also often delayed and the quality and the service is very bad!",1
"Had a flight from Yangon to Siem Reap via Bangkok with AirAsia. Found out at check in that a bag fee 36$ per leg of the trip - 72$ in total for a small bag that I've been able to carry on all other international flights. Our seats had virtually no leg space, it was quite uncomfortable and I am only 5'7"". They only had the option to buy meals and I could not get water or any other drink without paying an additional fee, we asked for water and they smiled and shook their head but they gladly made several trips down the aisle trying to sell teddy bears, perfume, etc.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Charged $65 at the gate for being a tiny bit over the 7kg allowance. If this charge was for any other reason other than the obvious, opportunistic revenue gathering, they would also be charging the people whom they deem to be over weight for the extra kgs theyre carrying. I do not feel this silly $65 charge is at all fair. Plane was then delayed because a tire was worn out and needed changing once we had all boarded. Nice to know they are on top of routine maintenance. Fingers crossed. After spending the last few years in Europe and having taken over 100+ flights on all major and budget of airlines I have to say Jetstar is my least favourite by a long shot. They wont Even without a multi year struggle pay their ground staff a fair wage. A totally soulless enterprise void of care for anything but its bottom line.",1
Flight from SIN-Manila. Very bad experience my wife had to suffer a 17 hour delay before the plane left Singapore and no proper explanations given. She had to board and disembark from the plane twice due to 'technical problems' and when a replacement plane finally flew in it was delayed again due to staff 'forgetting' to get landing clearance from Manila Airport. All in all a very bad experience and we won't be flying with Cebu Pacific again.,1
Singapore to Amritsar. I am not comfortable with the flight because they do not provide a mobile charger point. I felt very uncomfortable. So next month again I travel Amritsar to Singapore but I don't scoot. So I request you please develop your flight facilities. That travel was very boring.,1
"Phuket to Sydney. Very bad customer service, cabin crew not attentive at all. Everything on the flight was overpriced. I paid $4 for the coffee which didn't have any taste. The price for the food and meals is expensive, no wonder no one was ordering the food or drink. On the flight only credit card was excepted as a method of payment. Even though airplane was new and cleaned, the flight was very shaky and there was a lot of turbulence.",1
"Mumbai to Bangalore. Low-cost airline with high-class service. The flight was on time, the ground staff were there to assist all passengers to get on board. Aircraft was mighty clean and the service was excellent. Bought a sandwich on both legs, which was amazing. When I compare the services of Indigo to the low-cost airlines in the US, all I can say there is no comparison. Indigo has a far superior product.",0
Flew Sydney-Singapore-Sydney in ScootBiz class. Flights were on time cabin staff were pleasant leather seat was OK but a bit hard IFE using an i-pad was OK but had a limited amount of content food was OK but small portions. While I prefer full service airlines Scoot is a Low Cost Carrier as such was pretty good value.,0
"AirAsia re-schedule my flight in April from Luang Pabrang to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur without prior notice. I try to contact AirAsia for a solution, there is no Singapore contact number. I have to use the e-form to contact them. The response from the Customer Service cannot solve my problem because I cannot accept the new flight schedule. I have requested AirAsia customer service to compensate me for cancelling my tour and my outbound flight because I have to cancel my trip to Luang Pabrang due to Air Asia re-scheduling my in-bound flight. The Customer Service Officer told me she cannot assist me because there is no such policy. I ask to speak to her supervisor and she told me she cannot transfer the call.",1
"Yogyakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Flight departed on time and touched down Kuala Lumpur 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin was very clean despite the rather short turn-around of 20 or so minutes. Announcements of cockpit and cabin crew were professional yet cheerful, providing the updates one would expect to feel welcome, comfortable and safe on board. As with most of AirAsia flights: very good value for money and overall good level of service in the air and on the ground.",0
Domestic Vietnam HAN-SGN-HAN on 10 and 12 October 2014. Airbus 320 both ways. Delays but I was informed early (SMS and email) and eventually in both cases - offered even better departure times as compared to what I was booked for. Staff nicely dressed in fresh youth style with black T-shirts (with discrete logo) and trousers. They were fast alert smiling and very friendly despite the flight was full to the very last seat. This is a LCC without free onboard service - but prices are low e.g. a hot meal (4 options) is 3 dollars inc. soft drink. The giftshop onboard offers e.g. colourful ladybags with airline logos for 4 USD. Jetstar depends on bus transfers in both airports as LCC carriers obviously do not get access the direct boarding/disembarkation gates.,0
Boarding took ages because of Jestar's inconsistent baggage policies. Flight landed early but disembarking took at at least 35min. Ground staff told us plane was parked at the wrong spot for incorrect airbridge! Seat width and pitch was good enough. Leather seat wasn't very comfy. The plastic seat pocket replacing the IFE screen area is unconvincing. Couldn't hold lot of items at all. Not clean either. Also disappointing was seat air con knob wasn't working and water could only be retrieved if people push the call button. The whole flight was noisy due to dozens of call button rings. The best part was the courteous and friendly crew service. Also impressive was the great piloting skills - smooth descent and no turbulence at all throughout flight.,0
"Bali to Melbourne. Biggest joke for an airline I have ever seen. Cannot maintain a firm flight booking time, constantly delayed if not cancelling flights. Jetstar is an appalling joke. Heaven forbid your bag is a few grams over or youre a couple of minutes late, yet they can stuff their customers about and suffer no repercussions. I dont recommend, I wont fly with them ever again and I discourage everyone else to fly with Jetstar.",1
"A couple of warnings. Jetstar flies from Terminal 3 at Narita, the low cost terminal. The Narita Express train does not stop at this terminal, so you have to get off at the Terminal 2 stop and walk about 700m to the check-in area. Also, there is no Business Class lounge in Terminal 3. So there is much less point paying for a Jetstar BusinessMax fare (as I did), because there is no access to a lounge. This is not mentioned on the Jetstar website. They say Qantas lounge access ""where available"", but any reasonable person would assume that, as Narita is a huge airport that Qantas flies to, a Qantas lounge would be available. I felt a bit cheated. Anyway check-in and boarding were very smooth. Onboard the airline offers good value for money, with a comfortable seat (for day flying at least) and a reasonable food and drink offering. The crew on my flight were very solicitous and attentive. Overall Jetstar Business Class is an excellent product in its class (but investigate whether you can get value for the BusinessMax fare before buying!)",0
Ballina-Melbourne on A320. Paid about $100 or so for a one way ticket which I purchased on Qantas website . Baggage allowance was 20kg and there was no detail on the QF website about incremental charges for excess baggage. Travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg - ie: 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. Jetstar charged me $300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. Qantas should be reprimanded for selling Jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and Jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesn't remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. Qantas customer service people in Melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a Jetstar issue (even though JQ is owned by QF and the ticket was bought on the QF website). Jetstar employees in Melbourne were unsympathetic said I should've known read the policies etc. One even suggested they should be charging more and didn't think $500-1000 was out of line. This airline is completely out of control and I vow never to reward either company with my business again.,1
"I booked Kolhapur to Hyderabad via Delhi connecting flight. But in a day 3 times, the flight time changed and delayed us more than an hour. I recommend that never plan to fly with IndiGo if you have scheduled work. Indigo announcing that they are the on-time departure company and is a joke. We have a lot of options for our journey. For the good name in hospitality kindly correct yourself. Because of your unplanned schedule, all passengers are suffering a lot.",1
"Disgusting service. You pay what you get for. Cancelled flights for international flights home with no notification or compensation. We were on hold for an hour and a half on our holiday and also on chat with no resolution outside of a refund which will not alleviate the issue as I still need to get home! We had to book another connecting flight and accommodation, and lost a day off of our holiday in addition to lost money with our existing accommodation. The customer service was pathetic with no complaints department or management to speak to. Completely apathetic response and no care whatsoever. Really unhappy and will never fly with this airline again. Despite paying for your meals you will get a burnt and crusty tiny meal for a 12 hour leg. Despite pre ordering meals you won't get what you ordered for. No complimentary meals or even snacks despite long haul flights. Worn and dirty airplanes with broken seat belts and arm rests. Pay extra and go with a reputable airline that will treat you like a human being and won't ruin the end of start of your vacation.",1
"Staff is unfriendly and overall makes you feel unwelcome. You have to pay for every single thing, and exceeding the (tight) 7kg carry on limit even by <1kg costs $65 - feels like they're just out there to get you. Seats are uncomfortable. Australian equivalent of Ryanair.",1
"I was in transit from Manila to Cebu via Philippine Airlines, flight from Manila to Cebu was scheduled to depart 10:20am and then i was to transit Cebu to Dumaguete at 12:30pm, via Cebu Pacific. Unfortunately, the PAL flight was a bit delayed and we did not land in Cebu until around 11;40am. I ran to the Cebu Pacific counter which was still open as they were waiting for another transit passenger who was flying Cebu Pacific from Manila. I did not have any check in baggage so i was ready to board. Cebu Pacific staff told me i could not board and that i missed the flight and that all passengers have boarded! I was then ignored after that! When the other transit passenger arrived who flew Cebu Pacific from Manila, they entertained this passenger and told her she can board as long as she did not have any check in baggage! I was aghast and shocked when i heard that they were going to board the other passenger who was at least 20 minutes behind me but would refuse me boarding when i did not have any check in baggage.  I told them how unfair i have been treated just because i did not fly Cebu Pacific from Manila, i was pretty much ignored. The staff had no regard for my well being and safety. I could have boarded that flight, instead i had to stay overnight in Cebu to catch the flight the following day.  I would never fly Cebu Pacific again. The worst customer service i have ever experienced from an Airline.",1
"Worst customer service ever. Last year, May 2020, our flight got cancelled due to COVID. Our refund request was validated. However, we still haven't received the refund. All other flights - different airlines - have refunded our money. A few weeks ago, there was light at the end of the tunnel - at least, we thought so - as we received an e-mail in which we were asked to provide our bank details so that we could finally get back our money. Note: it was explicitly stated that we had to reply within 7 days, which is odd as AirAsia does not reply to us at all. I have been trying to get in touch with an actual human-being for over a year now. Facebook, website chat, WhatsApp, all you get is AVA the chat bot. I provide them with my case number, my personal details and all I get is 'I am sorry, we could not find your details in our system', which is complete lies. I understand that the world has changed due to COVID, but all organizations seem to have adapted by now. I simply want to speak to a human-being to ask them about my refund request. Sure thing, I will never fly again with AirAsia. Short-term thinking, AirAsia.",1
"Singapore to Sabah via Kuala Lumpur. I canceled my trips with AirAsia, and got fully refund into the credit account. The procedure took me around a month to be credit into my AirAsia member account. Although those credits have to be spent within a year, but I am glad and very satisfied with the services.",0
"This is such a convenient flight from Chiang Mai to Hua Hin, as it eliminates the +/- 3.5-hour transfer from Bangkok to Hua Hin or +/- 3-hour transfer to Cha Am. Pity, it's only 2/3 times a week, usually on Wednesdays and Sundays. The aircraft, staff and service are what you would expect from any AirAsia flight. Efficient and cost-effective. No frills to the extreme - but worth every penny.",0
CGK-SIN return. Cheapest fares compare to competitors with 20kg baggage allowance. delayed for 20 to 30 mins for both legs without any reason or announcement. Online check-in not available for international flights. Got brand new 737-900ER for both legs. Seat pitch quite tight BoB very limited FA's just doing their job and the inflight magazine is the only thing to entertain you.,0
"Cairns to Melbourne. Appalling customer service flight up to Cairns cancelled, informed by text message at 01.45 am only to spend next 40 min finding an alternative flight that was over 4 hrs later. Only communication is via text! Flight from Cairns to Melbourne delayed by over 3.5 hours. Very poor communication left stranded for hours with few updates and no genuine apologies or care. Do not fly Jetstar unless you like spending time sitting around airports.",1
Auckland to Wellington. Never having flown JetStar before I was a little hesitant however there was no reason to be. The flight is quick so only an hour or so. Seats are comfortable and staff were very friendly on the outbound and pleasant enough on the inbound return flight. We upgraded our seats so we were in the more leg room section but on such a short flight it is not necessary.,0
"I like Air Asia for been a good low cost airlines. But when you have an issue, the problem are starting and you will find nobody at the end for a solution or at least an answer. Air Asia changed the flight schedule by 5 hours and this was not compatible with my holidays. So I asked for a refund on Dec 2. On Dec 16, I went through the long and inefficient talk with robot AVA until I get in the queue for a human agent with n90. After an hour, I got an answer: your refund will be done in 2 days. On Dec 20, after playing again with AVA for half an hour, I was granted to the queue with number 144. And after 2 questions, the chat was terminated by the agent or ? and I still not get and answer. But every time the claim case was solved. I guess this is a great satisfaction for Air Asia to close claims, without answering their customer. In fact AVA was better than the agent, but both are inefficient. So I gave up with AVA, and called the phone voicemail service for Air Asia Thailand. I explained my case and  after 24 hours still waiting for a call back when it should have been done in 24 hours. But for urgent case I can contact AVA: joke. Form this experience, I notice that the customer service at Air Asia is non-existent, but also when you consider the price of the ticket (must check everything: seat, luggage, food), Air Asia is no more advantageous compare to a normal airlines like Malaysia Airlines or Thai. And for a small difference of the fare you can talk to a real agent instead of a stupid robot and incompetent agents. For the future I will be careful before booking at AirAsia, since this company reschedule and cancel flights many times since the start of COVID and the new normal.",1
"Worst services from Indigo, rude and unsupportive staff, no helping or support given to passengers. They treat people like travel bags, keep sending from one place to another without proper guidance and no use of customer care services physically or on call. Just a waste of time.",1
"Singapore to Jakarta. Lion Air has a bad reputation of having delays over and over. And this delay problem happened to me on my flight from SIN to CGK. We were departing at 14.50 and boarding at 14.05.  Not until around 14.30 the plane arrived and passengers are just getting out of it. Meaning that the plane just arrived from another flight. At 14.50 we begun boarding and at 15.15 we were taxiing. After around 30 minutes in to the flight, they put seatbelt on is still on and apparently we were having some turbulence but it's normal. Then the flight attendants offer some food and drink (which is very nice, I ordered the fried rice with ebi katsu). For the cheap price, Lion Air offers a reasonably comfortable seat for me. This is probably because i'm only 165 cm and quite skinny. The plane is quite clean and new although the stickers on the tables was ripped. But the lavatory could use some improvements. When we arrived at CGK we used the jetbridge. This is rare as usually they used busses. Baggage claim is quite the wait and they also changed the conveyor belt number. For the price, Lion Air offer good flying experience.",0
Singapore to Bangkok. Value for money. No fuss smooth online check in. Staff onboard was accommodating and professional. Pleasant short flight. Take off and landing was also stable.,0
Took advantage of specials to Japan to either Osaka or Narita flying from Sydney stopping at Gold Coast. Very surprised with the service I received flying from the Gold Coast to Narita on A330. Staff are friendly helpful and less rude than their domestic counter parts. Flight to Narita was 9.5 hrs from Gold Coast and add around 1.5 hrs from Sydney to Gold Coast but still being a very large plane and only around 50 or so people on board you can take advantage of the 4 seaters. I have learnt that you don't have to book seats on these flights and pay an extra $25 for it better to use that money to add check baggage to your flight and checked baggage isn't really cheap at $45 for 15kg. The food was ok best to bring your own snacks and water.,0
"Kolkata to Mumbai. I had a wheelchair passenger. Indigo provided no help getting onto the flight to Mumbai on Nov, 15. She had to walk to the gate. They issued the boarding pass but didn't wait for us and closed the gate 35 minutes before departure. They then charged me extra Rs.6500 to get us on to another flight. I have noticed the exact same happening to another senior citizen couple at the Mumbai airport on Nov 28th. When I objected they issued two tickets to the couple for free. Indigo seems to be cheating elderly people using this technique.",1
"Singapore to Bangkok booked for November 2018. In their website, they show that there is $0 processing fee. However, we were charged $20 processing fee for per person. When we lodged a complaint via email, they state that processing fee applies when we made payment via credit card. But they choose to hide these fees from customers when customers are making their payment. booked for November 2018",1
"Cairns to Tokyo. Upon checkin in Cairns I was asked to show an onward ticket which I did not have and was refused the check in. I have travelled a few times to Japan with other airlines and this has never happened. I know the rules, which are 'may refuse'. The rule is meant to avoid suspicious people to get to the destination, be refused entry and sent back, apparently at the airline's expense. This rule is flawed because, upon arrival, the traveler's ticket will not be for that day, it may be up to 3 months in the future. Internet tickets are generally not allowed to be changed or cancelled. But if a ticket can be cancelled (such as 1st class tickets), then the traveller can cancel it straight after checkin anyway. The Jetstar personnel was unsympathetic to the extent of malicious and could have caused me to lose not only my $700 flight, plus the other inconveniences with missing the flight, but also to lose my hotel reservation in Tokyo. But ultimately, it is not just the money, but the unpleasantness of having to deal with their personnel as badly suited to their job as they were. I did buy a ticket on line, but I will never fly Jetstar again.  I do want to say though that the food and service on the flight were good but that was not enough to compensate for my overall experience with this awful airline.",1
We've just come back from a trip to Vietnam where we had two flights booked with Jetstar. I have to say that our overall experience was very frustrating. The time of our first flight - Hanoi to Da Nang was moved from 9.15am to 7am with 11 days notice. Our second flight - Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh was changed from 5.15pm to 10.55am - we managed to contact Jetstar and be moved to the 6.15pm flight. However the departure of this flight was then changed to 8.55pm we received an email notifying us of this 2 days before the flight however many people we met at the airport did not receive any notification. Then on arrival at the airport we found that the flight had now been delayed to 10.15pm. With other airlines when we have experienced changes and delays we have always been offered either compensation or drinks / food vouchers at the airport - not the case with Jetstar!,1
Flew ScootBiz Sydney-Singapore-Taipei-Tokyo-Singapore-Sydney. 6 flights in total. All on time and even arriving early in most cases. Great onboard service and Scootbiz is a fantastic premium (not Business) product. We have also flown Economy with Scoot before and we cannot speak highly enough of the benefits of this new low cost airline.,0
SIN-DEL The flight was awful. I asked for an exit row seat and got the seat in front of exit row which did not recline. Had to sit upright for 6 hours. Babies hollering and crying everywhere. No food or drink unless you buy - they should at least serve a sandwich on an international flight - what does it cost? 50 cents?,1
"Hong Kong to Cebu via Manila. I concur from experience with much that has been written in complaints as warnings to prospective passengers, but the worst scam from Cebu Pacific, and most likely it is Company Policy, is their one of an onward or return ticket requirement. My partner and I have both experienced that demand from their check-in staff, yet from no other airline during our frequent travels. In one instance my partner's destination visa was clearly annotated Return/onward ticket not required, and we subsequently found that it was not possible to obtain a refund for the return ticket purchase demanded by check-in as a condition of boarding. I was told just several weeks ago that return ticketing (to where? country of departure or home country?) was a requirement"" for my return to the Philippines, despite holding a 59 day visa as I have used regularly for 5 years, taking usually 4 flights every 2 months, almost exclusively with Cebu Pacific. On arrival at Manila I was granted entry, and no evidence of an outbound ticket was requested by the border staff. Both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bureau of Immigration suggest that this an ""airline requirement, which means that everyone, every time they fly international routes with Cebu Pacific, may be scammed into purchasing a new ticket with no refund option, reschedule fees exceeding the value of a new booking, and only a smug reply from the Customer representative suggesting you Put up and Shut Up! My experience suggests that any further correspondence or discussion will be ignored. So if the check-in delays dont steer you towards another airline; as untrained staff study the worlds immigration requirements, then check with their superior, before eventually accepting the next Guest from the queued backlog; maybe the very real likelihood of your ticket actually costing you twice as much as advertised, and reasonably expected, will find you seeking out an airline which cares just enough to complete your journey without further blackmail. Im not willing to take that risk again, despite their cabin crew, aircraft, and timeliness being quite acceptable, as their admin staff and I-hate-to-call-them managers have finished them for me! I have seen many other passengers subjected to this same arrogant inconvenience and expense, our experience appears very common, but Ive seen it only with Cebu Pacific check-in staff. Online booking hassles are a warning of things to come, both price changes and charge confirmation difficulties requiring calls to CP. When you finally are accepted at check-in there are pedantic baggage weight limits applied indiscriminately, apparent separation of baggage for customs scrutiny at the destination, last minute flight cancellations with no alternative offered, musical chairs boarding gates and unintelligible announcements - its an impressive list, and dont think youll forget the hassles over a delicious in-flight meal, either!",1
"Be very careful with AirAsia, we booked an flight and after once changing our timings from Air Asia they just canceled our flight. We have to book another airline to get to our vacation, of course much more expensive. There was flights from AirAsia available but they didn't offer us. So now they are not paying the money back, they hold it on the air Asia credit account. I try to get my money back but AirAsia refuse to pay back.",1
Flew BOM to Goa return and BOM to Delhi. The Goa flights were rescheduled many times and we got constant updates by SMS many weeks in advance. Check in at Bombay was smooth with the web check in counter being empty. Flights on time and service was good.,0
"Hyderabad to Ahmedabad. Generally good in terms of punctuality & service, I had a horrible experience when I missed the flight. They are not accomodating in such matters & charge you for rescheduling the same. In my case I had just missed the flight by 5-10 min. They now charged more than my original flight to reschedule it where I have to wait for 6 hours.I missed my flight due to cab strike in Hyderabad but it was not their responsibility! While one can argue that they did everything by the book, customer satisfaction was not at all their priority",1
"Manila to Bangkok. The worst part was the check in counter. I had already checked in online but had to check in my pre-paid for luggage. I was there approx 3.5 hours prior to boarding time yet the line up took over 1.5 hours. It was  chaos and only 2 employees checking everyone in. Standing for 1.5 hours is outrageous. Then we boarded the plane 40+ mins late. Once we got on the plane we didnt leave the tarmac for another 70 minutes. I was unable to make my connecting flight to Chiang Mai. The next flight out was over 7 hours later and air Asia did nothing about it. No hotel, no vouchers, no compensatio.. I had to sleep in the airport, miss a half day of my vacation in Chiang Mai and forfeit my hotel I had pre purchased for in Chiang Mai for the night. Talked to several different air Asia employees in Bangkok airport, none of which were even the least bit helpful or simpathetic. Wont  fly airasia again.",1
"Phuket to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. Within less than a month of my scheduled flight, they cancelled my returning flight home to Sydney and rescheduled my flight for 2 days later with a 17:30hr Layover in Kuala Lumpur airport. They would not compensate for any of this the only thing they could do is give me another flight time 2 days earlier than my original booking date and with a 9 hour wait in Kuala Lumpur Airport which means I had to lose out on money with pre booked hotels and ferries and pay for taxis.",1
Flew MEL-MCY return on JQ794 11th Jan and JQ793 18th Jan. JQ794 - 11th Jan 2014. Aircraft: A320 VH-VGT. Seat 20F. We had carry on only and we used web check in so we could go straight to the gate no queuing or anything. Flight was on time and aircraft was clean. Seat was adequately comfortable however the legroom was limited it would be a bit uncomfortable on a longer flight. Crew were especially good on this flight very welcoming and helpful. Didn't purchase any food onboard or entertainment onboard - no need to spend the extra $$ on a short flight. Arrived early. JQ793 - 18th Jan 2014. Aircraft A320 VH-VQQ. Seat: 28F. Flight was good seat pretty comfortable more legroom on this older and differently configured aircraft. Once again didn't purchase any food or entertainment. Crew were helpful. Arrived on time. Overall I was very pleased with the service. We just wanted the cheapest fare so we don't care about extras like luggage entertainment food. There was nothing to complain about - Jetstar excelled in every area and I would definitely fly with them again.,0
"Our flight was cancelled, which we did not know about until we got to the airport early hours of the morning. We had been contacted via email the previous night while we were sleeping. Although it was heart breaking to miss a whole day of being in Australia since we were only going for the weekend for a wedding. We were grateful that we were able to be scheduled on a night flight via JetStar the same day. However, this review is to provide feedback on the staff that was on duty to provide other options for us customers whose flight were delayed that morning. It was a long que and everyone were waiting patiently despite the lack of sleep and change of plans. It was disappointing to view that the staff kept on cutting corners in serving his own people in which we witnessed a total of three (not travelling together) before we got served. None of these customers stood in the que and walked straight to the desk and chatted with the staff in their own language. Fed up, another had walked to the counter just when we got there and one of us told him to go to the back of the line in which the staff stated that we needed to calm down and threatened us with calling security. We left it as it is because we were desperate to get on a flight that day as we did not want to miss the wedding altogether. Hopefully staff gets taught about fairness and it is not about cutting corners with your own people.",1
Singapore - Miri Miri - KUL. Cabin staff were more interested in themselves and each other than actually doing anything vaguely like serving passengers. A smile from half way across the cabin isn't service it is nice but that is all. The only good thing about AirAsia is the price. There was not even cabin staff ensuring passengers stored their bags for take off and landing properly.,1
Singapore to Pune via Chennai. It was reasonably good flight. Specially it was on time. Connection was swift. Ground staff was little rude but cabin staff was very good. I think it was quite value for money service as it was cheap ticket to Singapore. Quite minimalist flight service as expected for a cheap ticket. Overall experience was good and will definitely give it a go next time. Thanks.,0
"Worst airline ever, changed the flight time three times, so in the end we were not able to take the flight due to the airline constant timing changes. We had to buy tickets with another airline, and chose the refund that was presented by AirAsia as an option. After months of emailing we never received even a reply on the sent emails, and no refund was received.",1
"Lion Air did their best for my flight from Bandung to Denpasar. The flight was on time. The baggage was also delivered quickly. It took less than 10 minutes for us to go out of the airport. The seat is OK for LCC, but the cabin was not clean enough. Not all cabin crew is friendly.",0
Jaipur to Bangalore via Mumbai. We were a group of 6 students who happened to miss our flight. The IndiGo staff at the Jaipur airport as well as the security were all really helpful and they helped us get through the critical situation. They were with us till the issue got solved. We will never forget this experience which was turned into a pleasant one by the IndiGo staff.,0
When I eventually get into my seat I'll leave another review but that's not for another 2 hours just a minor 7.5 hour delay. What is so spectacularly unacceptable was the lack of timely/accurate information so now we have wasted a day here in Melbourne and lost a precious day of our holiday. We chose Jetstar as it flies direct from Melbourne to Honolulu rather than Qantas which goes via Sydney to save 4 hours. Foolish us.,1
"Flew Jetstar Airways from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. Terrible delays! Will never recommend! We received multiple messages of delays within hours. Our flight kept getting pushed back hour after hour. We had reservations for a pick up in Hanoi and a hotel we had to cancel because of this! Terrible airline, never flying again.",1
"Following the Jetstar email suggestion I web checked in but upon arrival there was no web check counter so joined a 45 minute check in queue. The fit out of the 787 for my flight from Tokyo to Cairns was the most cramped of any plane I have flown on besides maybe small turbo props. I had to have my legs slightly sideways the whole flight, and the back of the seat in front was closer than I have experienced on a jet before and I have flown all the low cost carriers, you were literally shoe horned in like a sardine with no room to move. Really surprised me being a new 787 I expected it might be a nice fit out but actually the opposite. For me Jetstar have crossed a line with this latest ultra tight squeeze seating and I will only use them for short haul flights in future when they are occasionally competitive on price.",1
"Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur. The only flight that would suit me on my date of travel. AirAsia had great check in crew and answered all my queries promptly with professionalism. Boarding was swift abeilt the slight delay. The interior of the cabin looked tired and perhaps a big of a facelift. Seats were showing signs of replacement required. Other than that, all went well. Good flight for this route.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Yogyakarta. Something very unusual happened, I was given a red seat for free. Probably the plane was full and there were no normal seats available. Although it didn't make any difference, because this seat didn't have any legroom (same as regular seats). Not very friendly flight attendants, tiny seats, not so low cost.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. The flight was cancelled and Jetstars refund terms limit your ability to make other options. The return flight was not until the next afternoon, costing me a days work. I paid for premium seating but the staff member sitting next to me got the window seat and felt like playing loud YouTube clips without earphones. I was told a refund would be possible but following up a week later they said because I took the flight home no refund (even partial for the inconvenience) was possible.",1
"My Daughter travelled to Melbourne with Jetstar. She tried unsuccessfully numerous times to check in online. It constantly came up with either an error or time out message. We decided that we would explain it at the airport and at worst be charged a small extra fee. They were not only not helpful but rude and charged her $160 for one checked bag! We ended up paying as they would offer no alternative. My daughter arrived at the airport excited and looking forward to her trip but left check in in tears from the rude service. I contacted Jetstar by web chat (you can't speak to them). They were equally unhelpful. They asked if we took a screen shot. we didn't as we had no idea this would turn into what it did. The ticket was booked on Kayak.com and there was no mention of these crazy fees. Even on the Jetstar site, it was very hard to find. They offered a $50 voucher. No use for someone living in Seattle! It would have been far cheaper to pay the extra for a Qantas flight. I used to think US airlines were bad. They have been out done! I recommend anyone looking to book in Australia to add up the real cost and try a different airline.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. Really good value for money. Plane is new. Very punctual. Cabin crew are well trained and nicely dressed. Seat is fine. Food is inexpensive but good quality and you can choose from a quite diversified menu. Boarding and disembarkation was organized very efficiently. Only inconvenience is you had to walk at KUL budget terminal for 10min from gate to plane through a shielded corridor.,0
LOP-KUL 17 May. I checked in online and got the boarding pass. Since I had no checked-in baggage I went straight to the immigration counter which was very convenient and save a lot of time. The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. Luckily the ground staff provided us with a simple meal. The flight was not full. I had the whole row to myself so that I could lie down during the entire flight. Of course the flight arrived late. The FA was ok. The seat pitch is a little bit short for me. I didnt order any on-board meal as I just had dinner prior to the flight.,0
"Never again! Over promised and under delivered. Found out at check in, my 2 teenage kids were downgraded to economy despite having bought scootplus tickets for them in advance 6 months earlier. Worst, at scoot check in counter, they promised SGD150 voucher per person and refund of difference in economy and scootplus ticket price or 30% of ticket price whichever is higher but failed to honor this after we landed back in Singapore. We called customer service but they just ask us to check our emails but never came through with a email notification of the refund and voucher. An airline that has no integrity and professionalism shouldnt be operating from Singapore giving SQ and Singapore such a bad image!",1
GOLD COAST-KUL-BKI-KUL-GOLD COAST. Flights took off on time. Our pre-booked meals were hot and delicious. Service was good but seats were very uncomfortable as it had no proper back support. Online booking for KUL-BKI sector had us all in different seats so we had to pay again to sit together. LCCT needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The signboards and facilities are in dire need of improvement. Toilets are wet and slippery. The taxi coupon tickets are a blessing and I have discovered during our shopping trips in KL that the taxi drivers driving the red and white cabs will refuse to use the meters to charge more.,0
Singapore to Bangkok. The rows of seats were very close together and seemed narrower than other airlines. Nothing was free or included in the fare not even water. They not only weighed my checked bag but weighed my carry-on. The flight itself was very smooth. I would definitely fly Air Asia again although admittedly it wouldn't be my first choice.,0
"I was flying to Singapore from the Gold Coast. My friend and I had some food with us. My friend is vegan, and there was nothing for her on their menu.  A stewardess came up to us after boarding and said that we were not allowed to consume our own food on board, we needed to buy food from them. After a 10-minute discussion she said she would make an exception for us and allow us to eat our food. She also said that it was her job to make us follow such rules. If you want to watch a movie they bring you something like an iPad. They do not have USB sockets to recharge your phone either. What they do have are the staff call buttons and light buttons located where you put your arms, so that you cannot prevent from hitting these buttons unintentionally while sleeping or sitting. As for the food, I had to order some food on the way back. I ordered Beef Casserole for $11. The taste and quality was mediocre.",1
"Cebu to Manila. Nearly 4 hours delayed. First it started with an email that the flight will be delayed due to further servicing then a second email on our way to the airport. However I heard at checked in counter desk a different reason that the assigned aircraft is not available but a new plane will be coming from Manila. And the lady at the counter told me that the plane will be further delayed. Once we passed security, we saw the departure screen was flashing further time of departure. So not sure who to believe anymore but I see lots of lies from AirAsia. This is the second time I actually experience this coming from Cebu so will try other airlines from now on and see who is better at keeping their time and also with communication consistency.",1
Flew Bangkok to Bali then Bali to Singapore. Planes were clean and new and seats were comfortable but small. I paid extra to book the first row and there was plenty of legroom. The first five rows are reserved for anyone who buys the premium seats (I think it cost about 10 bucks) and they were mostly empty on both flights so I was able to lay down and sleep across the second row. I pre-booked a meal for a few dollars and it was pretty good. Only complaint is they bus you to the plane from the terminal so boarding is a bit hectic. Overall great experience for a budget airline.,0
Bangkok to Melbourne. Just don't book your ticket with this airline. I had a direct flight from Bangkok to Melbourne 8.50 hours. It got canceled on the morning I was flying due crewing requirements. The ticket they could offer me was a flight from 20 hours and a layover. The next day it would again be a 20 hours flight. When I asked what they would do to compensate this flight the answer was: a refreshment voucher. They wouldn't book a flight I had found with a different airline because they wouldn't be able to guarantee the safety of the flight. So I booked a other flight with a different company and I needed to pay this myself. The staff was not helpful at all.,1
Bangalore to Delhi return. Ground staff and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. The planes used also were new clean and comfortable. The food too was pretty good. However it is better that they sell at least a water bottle. Although they do sell water they provide it in paper cups and every time I had to pay Rs 40.,0
Jakarta to Tarakan via Balikpapan. Seat pitch is the smallest I have seen on any airline. Boarding in Jakarta was from both the front door and rear door. They have assigned seats so people boarding from the rear door were trying to move up to the front of the plane. Needless to say this is impossible. The amount of pushing and shoving is brutal. Left 23 minutes late due to boarding. Inflight nothing is offered on a 2+ hour flight. Flight attendants are young and stay in the galley with the curtain closed. The 737-900ER holds over 225 people. They only have 3 toilets - that's it.,1
My flight to Tokyo from MNL Jan 6 was canceled due to hydraulic problem as mentioned by the captain when we are already onboard the plane. They said we will be delayed for an hour but eventually it was canceled and rescheduled the next day. Jetstar accommodated all pax in a five star hotel with free meals so for a budget airline it was very good.,0
JQ 401 on July 14th was cancelled due to staff shortage. Were kept waiting and chased from gate to gate forwards and backwards only to be told after 3 hrs that the flight was cancelled. Were offered transport to ibis hotel at olympic park after another 4 hrs am wait. We preferred to take the train where we had to deal with our luggage and changing trains 3 x. The food allowance was $30 in a hotel where the cheapest hot dinner meal costs $28. No money left for the $35 breakfast. The first flight they could book us on was the following day at 2:35 pm. At 2:29 we were told the captain is late for work.,1
"The flight was just about alright for the 2 hour hop between Delhi and Mumbai. IndiGo has introduced automated baggage drop but the instructions etc are not very clear so most end up needing assistance. Delhi's Terminal 1 is undergoing significant modification and hence the on-ground experience is not very good, with chaotic security lines and limited food options and charging stations. The in-flight experience was courteous but clinical, a typical LCC experience. The legroom was adequate and being an Airbus, the seat width is better but the slim seats are not very supportive and I would hate to be in them for anything longer than a 2 hour journey. The crew do offer free water on the flight on request and in a small glass but only after the pre-booked meals are handed over which on a hot day can be awful. Remember to carry a water bottle since in flight water bottle cost The absence of chargers, app based IFE will be felt on longer journeys. Overall a no-fuss experience but worth it only if you are saving at least 1000-1500 over full fare carriers like Vistara/Air India on the Bom-Del leg, other wise the cost of food at the airport or on-ground will mean the net savings are nil. For Frequent Fliers with status on other carriers, the bar is even higher.",1
"A typhoon had hit the Philippines and they had announced cancelled flights. 5J 805 was not in the list, so I went to the airport. I go to the airport and they tell me to go through check-in. Overly long line only to be told at the end of a 1 hour wait that the flight was cancelled and that I had to rebook. I rebook to a later flight that they said will fly. 5J 801 is then cancelled 2 hours before. Insurance for both flights are suddenly eaten up by the void. Refund takes 2 months to push through. Definitely will not recommend. Quite the terrible cash grab and blatant highway robbery.",1
Was a bit sceptical flying business class on a LCC. But it worked perfectly. SIN-BKK on a rather old but well kept 777. Seat pitch ok for the short flight was addressed by name food very tasty. Flight was on time and thanks to the complementary streaming IFE I did not get bored. It was better than a C class flight of a similar length on Qatar the day before but at a fraction of the cost.,0
"I had a recent travel with Indigo from Dammam to Bangalore via Hyderabad. While transit one of my Hand Bag was missing from Hyderabad, upon asking the same the staff behavior was so bad that they didnt even apologize for the missing bag and not bothered to answer properly. After waiting for one hour in airport finally they said that they have made a mistake and my bag was still in Hyderabad, they handed over a PIR stating that they will send the bag ASAP, after two days when called there is no proper response and still they are unable to trace the bag.",1
Basic. Budget. Seats though new are small. Inflight meals and drinks are not served and youve just got to wait for them to reheat your food if you ordered. Inflight orders are suspended till much later in the flight. So pack your drinks and snacks. It doesnt seem like were getting served anytime soon. Ordered the katsu sandwich. Its served cold. Yucks. Selection of meals are poor. Just snacks and majority are sweets with a few cup noodles on the very basic menu. Inflight shopping is poor too. I hope we last the flight! Not sure if we will fly it again. We feel neglected.,1
"Tirupati to Pune via Bangalore. Traveled with few airline during visit to India this time. Found seating arrangement of IndiGo much more comfortable than others. The best part was, ground staff Nagraj at TIR airport was serving customer extraordinarily. I needed flexible info. for my return flight to Pune, and within short time he provided the same. Simply marvelous. Thanks IndoGo for serving your customer in this fashion.",0
"Beware, you think one checked bag is available per person because you are flying internationally and that's the norm. However, the fine print, very fine print, since no where in the ticket purchase did it say you have to go in separately to purchase bags at least 24 hours prior to trip. When you get to the airport, they say you cannot check bags or must pay $25 per kg! What? I've never heard of such a policy. After some haggling (while worrying we'd miss the flight entirely during this lengthy process) we got the price to $225 for both of our bags, which is still far steeper than the $105 it was supposed to cost (again usually international bags on most airlines are free). We did pay $800 for a ticket after all. Then, on board, you cannot even get water, soft drinks, or coffee without paying a fee. Nothing is free. Plane is cramped. I'm simply writing this review to save another person from this unexpected horrible experience. Fly another airline at all costs!",1
Very efficient and professional. All flights on time plenty of leg space for decent additional fee friendly staff.,0
Flights from Pekanbaru to Bandung and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to me. However flight attendants are not very friendly towards passengers. Other than that I think no problems the flight on time.,0
"Goa to Bombay. Flight delayed an hour ""due to runway issues"" in Goa. Ground staff very helpful and accommodating and blocked out 2 adjacent seats for us at the front of the aircraft. Aircraft (A320) was clean crew were efficient although a little harried with the buy-on-board meal service given the short flight time. Good value for money and would fly them again.",0
"Lombok to Bali. I'm 6'2"" and could barely fit my legs in, would be impossible for taller people. Shortest leg room I've ever experienced, do not take anything other than very short flights.",1
"I am flying from Denpasar Bali to Melbourne on 21 January 2017 with Jetstar Airways. I was surprised with the flight. Low cost but they have audio video on demand. Free for general information, USB gadget charging, and headset. Pay for movies and music. Pay for meal and drink, but free for still water. Check in process running well. Good services from local staff. Then flights attendant is plain/fair. I think this flight exceeded my expectations.",0
"Osaka to Honolulu. Shameless price gouging with combined 7kg limit for 2 pieces of carry-on. Flaky website so that you can't pay for checked-in luggage online and forced to pay double the price at the airport. Terrible customer service: staff openly mocking you suggesting to put on all the clothes from your luggage to make 7kg limit. No empathy, no compromises, no apologies, instead rude, dismissive attitude. Staff members covering their ID tags and refusing to call their names so I could file a complaint to upper management. Just out of spite check-in counter staff put me on SSS (selective security screening). The last manager I spoke to had a strategy of listening to my complaints with a poker face, not responding until the gate is about to close, and I am forced to shut up and board.",1
"I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with missing luggage during my travels with Indigo. Upon arrival at my destination, I discovered that my luggage was nowhere to be found. The process of reporting the missing items was time-consuming and lacked clear communication. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and there was a noticeable lack of urgency in resolving the issue. While I understand that mishaps can occur, the delay in locating and delivering my luggage was frustrating. I felt a disconnect between the airline and its passengers during this ordeal, and the updates provided were minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my belongings. In the end, my luggage was eventually recovered and returned to me, but the overall experience left me with a sense of dissatisfaction.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. Jetstar has to be one the worst airlines I have come across. The service is appalling, the staff are curt and very unhelpful. We were charged $120 for a few kilos over the 15kg limit. I appreciate it is our fault that our bags were too heavy but what airline only offers a 15 or 40kg weight limit. It clearly is a money making scheme. I wouldnt mind if their service was efficient and ran on time but now after spending $120 our flight is now delayed. I will go out of my way to make sure I never fly with this airline again.",1
"Jetstar Airways exceeded expectations and one of the best flying experiences I have encountered. We booked late and had to take the last two seats available - 1E and 2F. At check in we were told we mustn't sit apart and we were reassigned to 1G/J. Flight staff were friendly and efficient for the 5hr 30 minute journey - from orange juices prior to take off, to drinks after, food (which was excellent, by the way) and coffee and sweets a little later. IFE offered most of what Qantas offered - wide selection of films, tv, radio etc.",0
Bali to Cairns. I understand its a low-cost airline but their excess wait for baggage fees are excessive! I had to pay $100 each way to have five extra kilograms and then on the return trip had to pay an extra hundred dollars for excess carry-on luggage that had to be checked. It wasnt so cheap one that was all over with. If I ever fly this way again I doubt I would use Jetstar.,1
"Sydney to Singapore. Planned flight: 14th December 2017 at 10 pm. Actual take off: 15 December at 2 pm The worst budget airline. The flight got cancelled. It was announced at the gate few minutes before the boarding time. We had another connecting flight from Singapore to Sri Lanka. However, we were informed that we would be given another flight next day early morning. So we were forced to collect our luggage and return home.Since we had a connecting flight, wehad to pay another 900 aud to reschedule the flight to Sri Lanka. When we returned  next morning to Sydney airport, we were informed the Scoot flight got delayed by 2 hours. Ok fine, still we had a hope that we could catch the rescheduled flight to Sri Lanka. However, finally the Scoot flight got further delayed and it left Sydney at 2 pm on 15 December. When we arrived Singapore, our (rescheduled) SriLankan airline flight has left and we had to book another flight to Sri Lanka by paying another 500 AUD which leaves next day morning. Finally, we arrived Sri lanka exactly one day later the scheduled arrival and paying more than 1500 aud extra for tickets and taxi. It was a horrible experience and like a nightmare to us. The ground staff at Sydney airport do not even know how to handle such issues. They were unprofessional and appalling. One staff member laughed at us when we asked for compensation for the connecting flight rescheduling cost, and the manager even threatened my husband saying she would not board us if we do not stop complaining. Overall experience was unspeakably awful.",1
"Sydney to Cairns. A while back I was involved in a car accident and approximately a third of my body was burnt. I now wear compression garments which act to compress the skin. I go to the gym and weight train approximately 4 to 5 times a week and regularly go jogging and hiking. Over Christmas I flew from Sydney to Cairns with Jetstar. I booked an exit seat as I am 6 foot 2 and I like the leg space. On arriving I was told I was not allowed to sit in the exit as I was not physically capable of doing anything. After trying to explain that I had no issues at all and the garments were only for burn compression, I was moved to another seat and told to contact Jetstar if I wanted a refund. If that was not enough of an insult, I boarded the plane to find that my seat and the other exit seats were filled with people who I highly doubt were able to physically help anyone. I was obviously discriminated against purely on my appearance and at no time did they consider my situation.",1
Hobart-Melbourne on an A320. I used Qantas Frequent Flyer points for this flight and couldn't check in online beforehand either on the Qantas or Jetstar websites. The flight was smooth and the service was efficient. However the seating was much tighter than on the Virgin E190 I had used a few days earlier. A kid behind me kept kicking the seat. This wasn't Jetstar's fault but the seat felt very thin and I felt every kick!,0
Bangkok - Melbourne Return - Business Class - May 2013. Could not fault either flight - brilliant value for money comfortable roomy seats great friendly staff and all in all an enjoyable and memorable experience for our annual holiday. Definitely great value.,0
Three flights Kolkata (CAL) to BBK and BBK-CNX return. All flights comfortable and with one exception on time. Air Asia's offer is basic but good. The seats are reasonably comfortable and better than many budget airlines. Having flown Air Asia for many years I notice the staff are not as enthusiastic as in the early days nor do they have time to interact with passengers. I wish the company would enforce their 'one carry-on bag' policy. Some passengers on one flight had up to four large bags. What's the point in having the policy if it's not enforced.,0
"Manila to Bangkok round trip and Manila to Kota Kinabalu return. All flights on time. Good, efficient check-in at all airports. Pre-paid baggage  so no hassles. Usual fairly expensive and not very tempting food options, so I tend to take my own food. Excellent fares and good service in the cabin. Terminal 3 in Manila is getting busy now but Cebu Pacific is still preferable to Philippine Airlines on these regional routes.",0
"Jakarta to Singapore. Tremendous online website, especially for mobile devices. Booking and paying for a flight has never been more easy. Two days before the flight I received a reminder email including flight and departure/arrival terminal details plus a direct link to the online check in website . Save/print or screenshot the email and thats really all you need. According to the email the departure terminal was number 3, in reality it was terminal 2F. The difference is a 30.000IDR taxi drive that can take up to 30 minutes. This can make the difference between making it in time or being late. Very sloppy from Air Asia as they have greatly invested in a big marketing campaign at terminal 2F itself. Simple mistake, big consequence. Check in was easy, quick and efficient. All the check in desks could be used for all Air Asia flights. Boarding was done by a bus that brought us to an aerobridge which seems an odd thing to do but ok, it works. Boarding was a little late, as was the push back of the aircraft. Jakarta can be a very busy airport but this was not the case for this specific flight. Total delay before take off was about twenty minutes. The aircraft cabin had a pleasant cold temperature and the boarding process was relatively quick, although the aircraft was not full. The aircraft itself felt it needed a big cabin overhaul. Carpet was dirty and the safety card / inflight magazines were sticky and dirty. As we all know, this is a low cost carrier and we all enjoy the low fares. Air Asia's main focus is delivering value for money. But, is it necessary to have a pink, brown and greenish advertisement for a coffee company all over the overhead luggage bins? Service onboard was friendly and all crew spoke good English. I even got a free sandwich and a glass of water as it was included in my added cargo baggage package.  In terms of service it is all you want and need from a low cost carrier and more.",0
"Chiang Mai to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. We needed to pay close to 4,000 baht just to check in our bag (weighing 23 kg). When we got on the flight the seats were so close together. They expect you to pay for any sort of beverage or snack during the flight- this includes water. On the way back, we decided to try to skip the hidden baggage fees and pay for it online, only we couldn't. Every time we tried to do so, we were met with the warning that their site was experiencing a 'glitch' and that we had to do this at the airport.",1
"AirAsia have provided an excellent customer experience throughout our journey. The cabin crew were very polite and helpful. I have found that most of the passengers traveling from Hyderabad to Mumbai are local travelers with ""Telugu"" as the native language. The announcements made in flight are in ""English"" and ""Hindi"" languages. It would be very helpful for the passengers if the announcements in flight are made in the native language for the domestic flights. All the elderly passengers would be comfortable with this change. Hope to see this change from my next flight with you!",0
"After booking, AirAsia cancelled departure flight citing ""operations reason"". Have to change flight to 1 day earlier. Next day AirAsia cancelled return flight also citing ""operations reason"". This caused travel schedule plans to be greatly hampered & I have to change hotel bookings etc. This is my 3rd time AirAsia cancelled flights abruptly causing inconvenience. I will never fly this airline again!",1
"I fly budget several times a year with AirAsia, Jetstar, EasyJet, Ryanair, etc. Cebu Pacific is by far the worst. I booked 4 flights with them, 3 of which were significantly delayed and the fourth from Puerto Princesa to Manila was cancelled. The boarding process is frustratingly disorganised and very slow and the customer service is non-existent. The cancelled flight was not explained, we were offered a different flight more than 24 hours later but this would've caused us to miss our connection so we opted for a full refund, which I have not received more than a month later. I have spoken to the airline and they say they have refunded me already, they have not. Don't be taken in by the low prices with this airline, fly with somebody else and pay whatever extra you have to.",1
"Pre purchased seat while booking was not allotted in boarding pass. In flight, pre purchased meal was not served. Flight attendant was non responsive to resolve issues. Finally asked to get in touch with ground staff to resolve issues. Extremely bad experience and will definitely try to opt for other options.",1
"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. Travel Insurance what a scam. I went online to book a return ticket to Thailand all went well past the flight from point of origin, then came the fun part, the web site opened a second link continuing with my booking, I paid for all and felt little unusual having to pay in 2 different segments one there in AUD and one back in Baht, so far all good. Then I read the fine print a few days in re my ticket, saying I'm only covered with my travel insurance while on flight to and fro, no holiday no time outside the airports, contacted the insurer being part of Scoot and the excuse was they insure the trip out but another insures the trip back. I said I want a refund they told me to contact scoot - now after 3 emails and no reply links so we cant continue the conversation - only after a number of days. Every time you submit an email again it takes up to 10 days. The frustrating thing is with such large companies there is no direct input to record your side of any story in hard copy or email. And no refund I needed to get new travel insurance. I will never fly with them again.",1
Bangkok-Delhi. Plane was new though no inflight entertainment which most of them have. No food or beverage unless you buy. For a flight of 4.30 hours strange thing. A cup of premixed tea cost 100 THB (INR 170.00).,1
Bangkok to Siem Riep. They charged us for our backpacks that were overweight by a few pounds. Their limit is 7 kilos and charged us $180 for a few pounds. We will never use them again.,1
Flew Coimbatore to Delhi. First of all thank you IndiGo for such caring staff. My daughter met with an accident and her left arm was affected. She had treatment from Ganga medical center Coimbatore. She was carrying an extension rod attached to her arm. We had three tickets but of different nos. The air hostess took proper care with arranging front seats for us. She made her relax throughout the journey.,1
"Melbourne to Manila. A truly awful experience, poor catering options, dismissive staff who seem more interested sitting in the galley gossiping, filthy toilets that staff never checked and a delay of 4 hours plus. Well priced flights but the trade off simply isnt worth it, use another airline.",1
"Asked to change to aisle seat denied at ticket counter and on plane even though they had several open available. When I booked ticket I didnt know or see wHere I wanted to purchase meals, I thought meals were included. I said I would pay and I had to wait over an hour till they accommodated other passengers. Then I could buy only certain and few items.",1
"This airline is a shocker with little respect for their passengers. Booked to go to Sydney today for a 12.45 flight only to have it delayed until 2.50 with no explanation, and then went into a holding pattern for one hour at Sydney, only to be told that the airport was closed so we all had to return to Melbourne again. Once down we were told that there was no more flights until 3.30 Saturday afternoon which was the next day. Now I understand about the closure in Sydney but Qantas were still flying and landing at the time of our departure and indeed they were still flying that night but rather then make the effort to fly later that night they just cancelled everything leaving me needing to get to Sydney but unable, not to mention that when I asked for a refund they told me that I should have taken out travel insurance and it was not their responsibility: Until I questioned why Qantas was able to land and Jetstar wasn't they stated that Qantas have landing rights over everyone and indeed they were also flying that night they then paid up.",1
"Bangkok-Chiang Mai Chiang Mai-Phuket Krabi-Bangkok. Tickets were considerably cheaper than similar options with competing airlines. Check-in was quick and efficient in all cases. You don't get any food or drinks. This being said service was good and efficient. For tall Europeans I would recommend you pay 10 USD extra and get extra legroom in the ""hot seats"". The planes were new and seats comfortable. Luggage arrived very quickly except on the last leg of our journey.",0
"Udaipur to Cochin via Delhi. Well this was a positive experience. I knew what to expect so was prepared taking my own water and snacks. The plane arrived on time and as soon as passengers were off, we boarded. Very efficient. We left on time heading first to Delhi. We had a long 6 hour wait but had to change terminals which you do by bus. The bus takes about 30 mins. We prepaid three hours in the lounge (good idea). Again the flight departed on time. Food and drink was available on board at s reasonable price although we took our own. The seats are just pads over a formed plastic seat but for short flights not a problem. The price was great, arrived and left on time both times. Would be happy to fly with them again.",0
"Brisbane to Hobart booked for November 2019. Needed to cancel my flights, I had to change them manually for another there and then with a $170 fee, I cannot just change dates, I have a family to take into consideration. Couldn't even book flights for my family at the same time, so we can't sit together. Supervisor wouldn't take the time to talk to me, and the staff member I was talking to said there was no complaint team I could speak to, then they left me on hold for hours until I just couldn't take it anymore and hung up. Lost $500.",1
"Another flawless flight. Flew Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata with IndiGo. On time, both departures and both arrivals. Smooth boarding from Bangkok. Impeccable onboard service und attitude. Chaotic boarding at Kolkata: a long queue formed at boarding. Fine. Then an announcement was made by a ground staff member, in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 16-30 would board first. Since the announcement was barely audible, people waiting in the queue were confused, thus standing in line, not knowing what to do. Ground crew member - only one IndiGo staff manning their pre-boarding desk/area - did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board. People waiting. In the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person, spoke to him and were allowed to board. No idea if these people were going to occupy rows 16-30. Nothing happening; line not moving; IndiGo staff still looking as if he was in a daze. No repeat announcement, in an audible voice, re rows 16-30. Since I was in line, had a seat in row 21, I broke the queue, presented my boarding pass, and passed security. Don't know what happened after that. IndiGo needs to get its act together in this area. Inflight service again impeccable.",0
"I am fully accepting that flights get cancelled. Currently I am in the Philippines with no more money, and I really needed to get home on February 11. After hearing of my cancellation, the first thing I did was went onto Scoot's webpage, and see if I could re-schedule a new flight at a later date. I forgot to add that this was not an option in my email to do this. I had a look at flights a little later, and found identical flights that were departing on March 29, and April 1, 2, and 3. In all cases, these flights were already mostly booked out, usually with 3-4 seats remaining available. I spoke to Scoot customer service to see if I could be transferred to one of these flights in lieu of my own. I was advised that this was not possible. Now, call me old fashioned, but shouldn't you take care of the customers you already have?  If this is how Scoot want to treat their customers, they deserve to lose their business. As for their call centre, OK people, but the dumb rules are enforced by the management.  And why a refund to my credit card takes 30 days when it was taken from my card in seconds, defies my understanding. Scoot have lost me as a customer forever.",1
Business class to and from Australia was well up to expectations. Flights on time comfortable seating clean and modern aircraft edible food polite helpful and welcoming crew. Likewise the 3 internal Malaysian flights in a single-class aircraft.,0
MNL-BKK-MNL 7 times in the past year. No problems at all with online ticketing using a foreign Debit Card. Prices can vary quite a lot from day to day and I've never managed to get one of their so-called very cheap GO Fares. Changes can be expensive and I usually do those at their ticket office in NAIA-3. This terminal is by far the best in MNL. Check-in is efficient in MNL (though less so in BKK) and pre-paying for excess baggage (over 15kg) is now available when you book. Excellent on-time reliability on all flights. For some reason they do run the cabin temperature very cold on the A320 and this can be uncomfortable on a 3 hr+ flight. I've no problem paying for a snack and a drink if the ticket price is significantly cheaper than the competition which it is. No in-flight movies so bring a book. Good value for money on a safe and reliable airline and I'll continue to use Cebu Pacific.,0
"Taipei to Singapore with Scoot. I paid extra for 50% more leg room with my wife, but was allocated 2 seats (6J/K) with faulty meal trays. Mine was labeled with a sticker that sealed the cover of the tray, while my wife's seat had a slanting tray. I alerted the stewardess about the problem before the plane took off, but no action was taken. When the meals were served, the stewardess didn't know what to do. After a few mins, she came back and asked me to have my meal at the biz class seat while my wife was unattended. She was holding on to the food all the time until I finished eating. She was then asked to go over to biz class to have her meal. My wife was very furious with such arrangement and refused to eat and requested for a refund for the service paid but not delivered. 2 more stewardess came and said there is no refund policy. This is the worse experience I have with any airline. If the seats are faulty, Scoot should not charge extra for the 2 seats. My journey was ruined by the poor service.",1
"Cengkareng to Denpasar. I am quite dissapointed with the service of Air Asia, they are not punctual with the schedule. Although they are cheap, they gave us poor service. On 7th July passengers were asked to proceed to the plane by bus. However, we were asked to stay in the bus for 30 minutes and asked to go back to the waiting room until further notice. Today, 4th August, using the same route, I experienced delay for my 21.00 flight. I just want to assure that cheap flights cannot degrade its service and punctuality, because, next time, I will rather use other airline (even more expensive one) in order to fly on time.",1
"Kunming to Bangkok. I booked my ticket with them well in advance and also pre-purchased baggage as it is cheaper to do so. I realized my ticket would be non-refundable if I had to cancel this flight, but I expected them to grant a credit with the airline for future flights. But they refused to refund any amount, even the baggage fees, and didn't grant any credit for future flights. This level of customer service is appalling.",1
Chennai to Visakhapatnam. Very good experience. Fantastic customer care. The piloting is awesome. Smooth take off and landings. International levels. Very good and courteous behavior of crew.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya with AirAsia Indonesia. It was a morning flight from KUL to SUB. The flight took off lakte about 20 minutes. The senior flight attendant apologised for the delay. Weather during take-off was cloudy. Generally, the flight was pleasant all the way to Surabaya. Landing was okay.",0
"Manila to Busuanga. Self check-in and drop-off of the case was quick and effective. The aircraft made a well-maintained impression. The seat spacing was good, the on-board staff were friendly and the food could be expanded against payment. Overall a good experience.",0
"Vientiane to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok. Worst flight experience I ever had. The only reason I went to the check in counter at my first leg of the flight was to see whether I was correctly checked-in since I booked through a 3rd operator. Showed my boarding pass on my phone, that was all fine, and then they gave me a paper boarding pass. While boarding, I showed my boarding pass on my phone, as I had put my paper boarding pass away, they acted like I was from another world having a boarding pass on my phone. They took me out of line, saying paper boarding pass all taking my pasport out of my hands. Then at my stopover, I couldn't transfer like I normally would on connecting flights, because my boarding pass had to be verified.  Really inconvenient to say the least, almost missed my connecting flight because of it.",1
"We flew with Scoot on our Singapore-Sydney route on the way back from the UK, which we booked through Singapore Airlines.  However, we were disappointed. We paid a little bit extra for a ""Scoot in Silence"" seat, which was like a small economy area where children weren't allowed. Food was pretty terrible (but included) however drinks were not included, except for water. We had brought our own water on board but had to pay for any extra drinks, which I wasn't happy about. No entertainment system, so come prepared with your own devices. I wouldn't fly Scoot again, and next time will pay extra to fly with Singapore Airlines the whole way.",1
Airasia Indonesia. SUB-CGK. Overall the trip was good. The cabin crews were polite. But the staff service wasn't very good when I entered the boarding gate the staff hasn't placed the airport tax thing behind the boarding pass although we had paid to her. Because of that we should wait for minutes before boarding the aircraft.,0
Satisfactory flight from a low cost carrier. Late to board but caught up some time. There was no inflight entertainment- I would have paid for a film to while away the time. The food we ordered was ordinary and I wish Id brought snacks on board. We had extra legroom seats . Recommend but bear in mind low cost carrier,0
My wife and I had to fly them 3 times on a recent trip to Indonesia and wouldn't go near them again. On the first flight even though we booked together and checked in together we found we were sitting in opposite ends of the plane. On the next flight we paid more online so we could sit next to each other only to be told after waiting an hour and a half to check in that we weren't sitting next to each other and to pay another $50. I explained we had already paid for this and showed proof it fell on deaf ears and we still had to pay the extra fee. Our bag was 1.5 kg over weight so they stung us for that. On all 3 flights we could not hear a word they said over the intercom onboard the flights.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Krabi and Return The flight was just 1.5 hours long and on time with decent legroom, though I did not book a hot seat, just a regular seat. Overall quite comfortable, clean aircraft and a good flight. The complaint if any is the fact that the lowest baggage allowance you can purchase is 20 kg, it would help if Air Asia gave a 10 kg or 15 kg option as well.",0
"I was surprisingly pleased with my OOL-SIN flight. I had spent the extra A$24 on a Super Seat and was very pleased with the legroom and recline angle as well as the comfort of the seat padding etc. The lack of headrests still baffles me though and I would hope they do something about this in the future. The crew seem quite inexperienced and do not show the calm and assertive behaviour that I am used to from most airlines yet they are friendly and polite. The scripted announcements with things such as ""Scooting off"" (instead of taking off) add to this feeling: friendly attempting to be fun yet not assertive or what I would consider professional air crew behaviour. The flight was delayed by some 30 minutes. All in all I would not hesitate to fly with Scoot again.",0
"When I reserve the ticket, the itinerary and agent says my ticket with Qatar airways, but reach at Qatar they says I am flying with Indigo. But it was ok. After check in, there were very bad customer service. They serve low quality food. There were not great customer service. Leg space was so narrow. Compare to Qatar Airways quality of the service very bad. Normal international flight they serve liquor. There were one time meal serve that that is pre packed with very low quality",1
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Not recommended if going on a business trip! Long delays, irresponsible staff, improper handling of baggage. Will never fly this airline again.",1
"Bali to Tokyo via Singapore. I had the worst experience during check in at Bali international airport. I was flying back home using 2 different airlines, no baggage, terminals I fly in is the same I fly out, all airports I fly in have transit zone.  The employee of scoot refused to give me my boarding pass cause I did not have visa to Japan, I did not need visa in this case I could easily transfer to my next flight without leaving the terminal. After asking him for a while to verify everything he was just sitting there and replying all the same ""I cannot"" . I asked to give me my boarding pass only to Singapore and he told me I cant get it as well cause I need flight back and if I buy a new ticket in front of him he can give it to me otherwise I wont get anything and simply losing all my flights. I asked for a manager and he refused to call the manager or somebody, I asked to provide me a complaint form and he refused to do so, he refused to give even a phone call to somebody who knows more then him.  All I wanted is to go home and not being stuck in Indonesia. Somehow I was able to get my boarding pass to Singapore from other agent who was very nice an understanding, she checked everything and verified that I actually can get my boarding pass. Thanks to other employee I was able to fly home without problems. As a company who are involved in international flights every employee should be familiar with every aspect of international travels. It is very serious for many people to be where they need to be on time. Please make sure your employees are not refusing people boarding passes and please be more understanding even if you are a budget airline.",1
"Flew AirAsia from Siem Reap to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. Every flight to get to and from our final destinations were delayed, causing us to miss our connecting flight and having to be put on one 10 hours later, with no offer of hospitality we had to ask for a hotel to get some sleep and the assistant then took 2 hours to actually walk us to this hotel. When it was time to fly, our flight yet again was delayed, and our gates were changed without notification forcing us to run from from one end of the airport to another, the flight attendants were unfriendly and to finish it off our bags were lost.",1
"I was travelling with my infant and wife, so tried to do web check-in so that we can get seats together, however all seats shown as occupied. So I reached the airport 2.5 hr prior to get seats together. I waited 15 min in queue then requested same to counter. She sent me to a different counter then again waited for 15min in a queue, then finally she said, we couldn't do it, so we were given 28A which having a baby seat also, you keep your baby in the baby seat and request co passenger for interchange. We couldn't find baby seat there, same thing asked to airhostess, she replied, there is no baby seat. They didn't even gave the baby belt, which is mandatory. Airline not for babies.",1
"Denpasar to Sydney. Staff were rude and lack of customer service. They hardly smiled and when asking for Pen to fill up the declaration form, they just had a rude face and was like ""Somebody borrowed mine"". Pilot was very good though. He was keeping us informed.",0
"Booked a few Lion Air flights in the past and most have always been delayed due to operational reasons. After a few years of banning Lion Air for my own sanity, I tried giving it another chance especially as the price is much cheaper than other airlines. Lo and behold, its delayed again - initially delayed for 30 mins, informed that its delayed for another 30 mins, and as I typed this Im in another 30 mins delay (no further hopefully but if there is any further, Im not surprised). Unless youre really tight on budget and really have all the time in the world, or perhaps you like to gamble, I don't suggest taking Lion Air.",1
"Worst flight experience ever. Had double booked due to system error. Filed in a refund request for one ticket to AirAsia but seems they don't want to give my money back. The process took so long and no customer service available anywhere to give your complaint directly. D-1 before my scheduled flight, my morning flight got rescheduled to the afternoon without other option available to refund or even reschedule my flight. The system in the check-in terminal is slow. I think the company is facing bankruptcy.",1
"A320-200 Sydney to Darwin.Boarding commenced 25 mins prior to departure and left on time. Information on the flight was provided by the cabin supervisor. Shortly after take off food and beverage for purchase was offered throughout the cabin, snacks were offered - $5 Soft Drinks $4 & Beer starts at $8. The leather seats are comfortable but have a limited seat pitch.The crew were friendly and attentive and dealt with customer requests efficiently.There is no wifi or ports to charge devices on the aircraft which can be frustrating on the longer domestic flights over 3hrs. The flight arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule.",0
"Extremely poor accountability when it come to Flight Cancellation. Jetstar is becoming renowned for its last minute flight cancellations. This is made so much worse by their lack of accountability or responsibility to their impact on their customer base. Had my flight cancelled by JetStar and they could offer another flight for 36+hrs , on top of this they offer horrible compensation for expense incurred and only if you choose to rebook with Jetstar. ($150 for accommodation and $30 for all other expenses per day) If however you book another airline the next day (24hrs earlier than their offered flights) they will not cover any of the costs.",1
"Flew from Hong Kong to Phuket on AirAsia. My first and last flight with them. A very unplesant experience overall: Long and slow baggage drop-off process, flight delayed, most unconfortable, old and tight seats. Food and beverage only with cash as they accept no credit cards. They don't even give you a glass of water for free. They are cheap, yes, but if you look at what you get, they are actually extremely expensive.",1
"Taipei to Singapore. I was on Scoot biz on the 22nd of June heading back home from Taipei. It was my 2nd flight with Scoot and I am very impressed with the crew on ground and onboard. The check in staff was polite and efficient even though she had to handle a big tour group before us. After getting onboard, we were greeted by smiley and polite cabin crew when offered water and confirmation of our meals. It was a great start to the flight. Soon after take off I tried to charge my device with the in seat power supply, however it wasnt working. We informed the crew in charged and was quick to get a response that the seat power supply for both 2h and 2k was down. I was disappointed but was lucky to have my own portable power bank. A few moments later, the crew in charged passed me a pink power bank and she explained that its her own personal charger. She apologised and went the extra mile and took the initiative to offer me hers even though I didnt ask for it. During the flight, she was seen helping 2 elderly couple in front of us with the Scoot tv app. She kept coming back to check on them and it was when meal service was about to start. I understand thats a very busy period for crew but she was professional and very patient with them and assisted them for at least 20-30 minutes and had left me very impressed. She was also always seen in the cabin during meals and duty free sales service. During the lull period, while walking to the lavatory, crew was also polite to inform me that there was a queue. Toilet was also clean the whole flight. Call lights by passengers around me were also quickly attended by them or passing crew from the economy class. I didnt expect much from a budget airline but I am left with a great impression with this experience. I will be looking forward to flying with Scoot again.",0
I will never fly this airline again. Our flight at the moment has been delayed 11.5 hrs and increasing as I sit at the airport. We have missed the Singapore Grand Prix day 1 race and concert (which we had tickets for). The communication to let us know what was going on was appalling. By the time they decided to let us know what was going on the earliest flight we could rebook for was 10.5 hrs later. My advice is never fly Jetstar.,1
"Flew AirAsia from Kolkata to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. As per the itinerary there was 90 minutes to make the connection. The first flight arrived 30 minutes late to Kuala Lumpur so I only had about 30 minutes to run through security and make the 15 minute cut off for my continuing flight. KLIA is a very large airport and I was unable to make the cut off in that short duration to board the connecting flight. AirAsia took that as a no-show and made me pay 74 Singapore dollars as a ""change fee"" to board the next available connecting flight. Terrible on the part of Air Asia for doing this. This was an AirAsia reservation and if they know that 90 minute was insufficient, they should not put it on their website. Secondly, the mistake was not mine. Why did I have to pay 74 dollars?",1
"I was due to fly out today 9/1/21 at 7am but due to the Covid so they say closures they cancelled the flight and sent me an email at 9.30pm at night! I was lucky to have gone to bed late and checked my email by coincidence and there it was cancelled flight. You can imagine my disappointment as I have called them twice previously and waited 2.5hrs on the phone to speak to an operator. I thought being 11.45pm I would be waiting only like half an hour but no I waited 1.5hr. No call back facility available. Then I get a lady who was very, very rude. I told her about my disappointment since the first time I called was due to Jetstar having messed up my transfer in a way that I missed my connecting flight. No apologies for having waited so long at 1am in the morning or for the inconvenience of cancelling the flight. So I asked her to see what other flight i could take so i could make my connecting flight to which she says and 11am flight but its through Qantas and yours was through jetstar so you will have to pay the difference. I questioned her on this as i said but Qantas and Jetstar are the one company and you are the ones who cancelled the flight not me. To which she retorted `You were the one who chose Jetstar'. So then after she calculates the difference and i think this is so wrong from all levels of customer service I instead asked for a flight with Jetstar for the Sunday which is a direct flight to my destination (no transfers as I cant trust them to get it right a 3rd time). So my question to Jetstar is why such long waiting time on the phone? Even after midnight? Is the Call centre in Mumbai as only one time out of the 3 times I called I got a clearly spoken customer service agent that resolved my problem swiftly and courteously. Why do you hire Customer service agents who cannot express them selves clearly, have no aptitude or problem solving skills or desire to help the customer. This is terrible for your business as I will not book with Jetstar again to sit in a phone line 2.5hrs average is just unacceptable. Last minute changes and no apologies and rude customer service agents who can't articulate themselves properly, have attitude and down right rude. My biggest gripe is why cant I change these flights online myself? It says you can but when you go to do it it says you must call a customer agent so its a futile process deliberately done to frustrate the customer and beg for something or a service that you have already paid for but will not get.",1
"Melbourne to Christchurch with Jetstar Airways. Our flight was cancelled two hours before it was suppose to take off due to crew requirements. All our plans had be changed because of this. It was good enough that Jetstar agreed to refund us our return ticket. The chaos and stress didnt stop just there. When we arrived at the Jetstar Check-in in the counter, we were told we had to apply for a tourist visa. This new rule was only implemented in October 2019. This rule applies even if you have a PR in Australia! We were so anxious about it because our flight was scheduled to depart in 1 hour. I would have rated Jetstar a 2/10 but Im thankful for a staff member at the check-in counter for helping my partner and I. She was really understanding and helpful with our situation. She managed to expedite our process. Lets just hope there are no more stressful surprises ahead.",0
"Bangkok to Chiang Mai. After boarded it was announced we need to get off and take another plane. This is the second time I have used AirAsia and a second unpleasant experience with them. First time was getting charged $140 for my first and only luggage at the airport, its only around 10kg.",1
"Nelson to Auckland. Jetstar canceled the flight four hours before takeoff. Next available flight was next day, 31 hours after scheduled flight. Made the trip impossible for me and I opted to cancel flight. Refund given after 15 days. Thanks for holding my money, Jetstar. I urge people to think twice, at least, before booking Jetstar.",1
"Very bad customer service and servere issues with reliability. I have flown with Jetsrar twice in a month and both time the my flights has been cancelled and rescheduled so that I have had to wait at the airport for half a day. The staff was uninterested in helping us and the fact that we had a baby at home and was unable to find a babysitter to look after our child until new flight arrived was ""not their problem"". Now sitting at the airport again with a cancelled flight. 5 hours to get through and screaming children. No apologies by the jetstar staff, not worth it for the cheaper flights. No way.",1
MNL-PEK-MNL flights were both on time. Staff friendly and attentive to every need. As it is a budget airline food is available for a cost but not really a problem. Very good value for money and would continue using them.,0
"AirAsia is by far the worst airline experience I've ever had. I had four AirAsia flights in the last week for my trip to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and Penang and back to Changsha) three of which were delayed. The ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. The chairs are quite uncomfortable, when it was time for landing, I didn't even realize my seat was reclined. Many of the passengers used their cell phones at inappropriate times which made me very uncomfortable. I would rather pay for a more expensive flight than take AirAsia again.",1
"2 delayed flights in one month due to late arrival of aircraft. First time, you could blame it on accident (although no explanation was provided). Second time in the same month on the same route shows a flaw in aircraft / route management. Each delay was at least an hour. The worst part is they didnt inform us well in advance as to the delay or how long it is expected to last. I would not fly Scoot again if theres an alternative.",1
"I booked my first flight ever with Scoot through their app. My flight was from Bangkok to Perth with a layover in Singapore. I did not realize that you had to set preferences for both legs of the flight. I booked 40 kg of luggage, as I was making a move. But apparently, it only booked for Bangkok to Singapore. Why wouldn't I be taking the same amount of luggage for the following flight if that is my final destination? I've never had to book preferences for each leg of a flight. Not to mention when it comes to seating, if you just 'continue' it will automatically pick a seat for you and charge you, you have make sure to uncheck the box if you don't want that absurd charge (that I actually caught on to). Anyway, on the app if you have a layover you have to slide the screen over to set your preferences for the following flights, which I didnt realize, because like I said before I've never had to do that. They could make the app more user friendly by actually guiding you through each flight instead of trying to trick you and making you pay more in the end because you had to book extra luggage after the inital booking. Also, when I called customer service the lady was extremely rude, she kept talking over me while I was trying to explain what happened.",1
Sydney to Brisbane. Budget service for a budget airline. Honestly I have never met so many rude staff members. From check in to the flight and return they were very rude. Food was overpriced and average but I get that being a budget airline. What I don't understand is why Jetstar offer appalling service when a smile doesn't cost them any extra.,1
AirAsia charges its passengers for practically everything that it possibly can. Did web check-in 14 days prior but could not select seat of my wish free of charge. Was alloted a seat by the system randomly. The ground service at Bhubaneswar airport was pathetic with the airline staff not clear about the transit rules. There was no line at check-in counter and people were literally crowding at the counters to get their check-in done. flight departed 15 mins late but arrived on schedule. The staff were a little cold on this flight. Did not have any issue with seat pitch (my height is 164cms). The pilot made periodic announcements regarding flight progress which was nice. Had pre-ordered kabali biryani which was served with coke. Quantity of the meal was fine.,0
Check in great. On time departure with an almost full aircraft both ways. Hawkes Bay airport are not helpful giving Jetstar a gate way out of the way. Could be much closer to the terminal as Jetstar was the only aircraft on the tarmac. Great service and great price.,0
Flight 6E 284 from Chennai to Delhi on 6th Feb 2014. I took the morning flight at 8.20 am this meant that I did not have my breakfast before the flight. The flight duration to Delhi is 150 minutes. I wanted to have my breakfast on the flight I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least. They just walked past me and did not ask if wanted anything. They simply pushed the trolley past and went and sat down. I gave up and sat extremely hungry and frustrated.,1
"Jakarta to Denpasar. After the flight was already 30 minutes delayed, I had to search for information myself, only to find out that there would be a delay of 45 minutes because of ""technical difficulties"". The airline's zero information policy towards its guests is shameful. Passengers are not ""customers"" at Lion Air, but simply ""numbers"". Not even the minimum requirements in the linguistic handling of passengers of other countries are met by the cabin crew. The crew speak a gaping English and can barely communicate with simple sentences. Even though the planes are outwardly standard, the care inside the planes is miserable. The cabin is dirty and more like a citybus instead of an airplane. Departure times are more of a guideline and changed at will, information will not be shared, the airline's constant delays are really ""remarkable"". On the returning our flight should have been 3 hours late without any advance information. It was not until I took a look at the boarding card that there was a different departure time than planned. Asked about the new departure time, the check-in staff member from Lion only commented: ""Yes a new shedule time ... we have technical problems with our aircraft"" ... then it would be better to rebook and return to Jakarta with another airline. As a passenger, I would like to be informed about changes to the timetable, etc. without being asked to do so and not have to do my own research first. There is also no service on board. Unless you pay. Is so far to agree with the pricing policy of the airline, but not that one can not even place his orders in English. For me it is by far the worst airline with which I have flown so far. Never again!",1
"Melbourne to Sunshine Coast. The flight departed and arrived on time. Check in was quite easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful . My pre booked meal (toasted ham and cheese sandwich) was quite tasty. One criticism, the beer could have been chilled. They had to offer ice. Overall an enjoyable flight.",0
Bali to Siem Reap via Kuala Lumpur. They charged me around 250 dollars for my baggage of 24.4 kg although it did not let me buy luggage online beforehand.  What kind of airline has such costs and flexible luggage rate based on which check in agent you get?,1
Manila to Singapore. Scoot rescheduled our flight for an earlier one. I even paid for the seat I chose which is the window seat. But when they rescheduled our flight we were seated in the middle seats. It really messed up our plans for that day. The worst part is the tickets are non refundable.This is the first and last time I'll ever fly with them.,1
All the paid window and aisle seats are reserved for those who will pay for it. Me and family got scattered from seat no 15 to 31. During boarding they made us a call to run fast towards gates even when we checked in an hour before the departure time.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Siem Reap with AirAsia. Flight left KUL a little later than scheduled but we managed at REP to arrive on time. Departed from KLIA2 and it was bumpy all the way. Got our pre-booked in flight meal which tasted good. Flight was uneventful but pleasant. Crew did the normal low-cost standard service. On the way back to KUL, I pre-booked a merchandise but didn't get it at first. Alerted the crew but he said they have no record of it. Showed my proof of payment but they still can't give it to me. Finally the senior crew did whatever in is ability to get it done for me and I finally got my merchandise. Good effort though",0
"Flight was cancelled a week before the departure, due to Covid19 travel ban. Refund was not generated automatically but I have to submit manually but unable to due to their system error. Keep appearing as cancelled. Despite many trial time, we are not able to reach to speak to an agent,  wasting much of my time.",1
"Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.",1
"I would not book with Jetstar Airways again and would not recommend it to anyone. My flight from Auckland to Palmerston North was cancelled a few hours before I was due to depart. I have since learned that this is a common occurrence with this airline. We were offered other flights the following day but believe that at least one of these flights was also cancelled, thankfully we did not take the chance of finding out and booked with another airline. During our flight we heard stories from other passengers of repeated cancellations!",1
The worst flight ever experienced in my life. My next IndiGo flight from Mumbai to Trivandrum is at 8.45 pm. The departure time of this flight was at 2.55 pm Im still sitting in the flight (Now the time is 5.18pm). We had spent a huge amount to book these two flights. And now Im going to miss my flight to Trivandrum. And the cabin crew is telling the flight will reach there at 7.15pm. As far as I know Srinagar to Mumbai will take minimum 3 hours flying time. The worst and horrible experience. Please dont ever choose go first flight even though they give it free of first. You will not only lose your money but your valuable time too,1
We flew from Tokyo to Taipei Taipei to Singapore and finally Singapore to Sydney. Each flight was terrible with each at least 20mins late. The old re-branded 777 planes are falling apart. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. After flying multiple airlines Scoot was by far the worst! Never again. 787 or no 787's the new planes wont fix your poor timing and service.,1
"Auckland via Wellington. we were going to a family bereavement, had a hotel and rental car booked in Auckland, checked in received my boarding passes, then 5 minutes later a flight cancellation arrived. The time from cancellation to departure was less than two hours, we were changed, packed, taxi ordered - no flights available that day.Sorry,  how about tomorrow and sorry we dont refund hotel and rentals. You're better off to walk ... its more reliable if you have a timetable, if you're totally flexible it may be ok. We travel to this destination monthly and this is the third issue of a "" engineering "" nature in the last year",1
"My wife and I checked in at Counter B-03 and we were greeted by a very friendly staff today at about 5.20 pm. After verifying our tickets, she even offered us a packet of peanuts that we love so much. We didnt ask for her name but we really want to thank her for the kind hospitality!",0
Auckland to Melbourne. Flight delayed to the next day without any reason given. This company obviously don't understand the meaning of customer service. Unprofessional and direspectful for their customers. Last time travelling with them. RATING 0/10,1
"Manila to Siargao. Generally, from the booking to my actual flight to the improved after flight customer service experience, no issues at all. I am going to give a low rating because I feel that Cebu Pacific management will not care. This is because of how my nephews changed flight was delivered and relayed. Flight time change should be handled with care and consideration. He missed his flight therefore, ruined our vacation plans.",0
Booked the tickets from Sydney to Melbourne (return) and Sydney to Gold Coast (return) via online travel agent. The main gripe was the check-in process although the system will send you an automatic SMS to check in online but still there's no difference without checked-in online that we still have to queue with the other passengers. Nevertheless the ground staff were really helpful and patient also the cabin crew were very friendly!,1
BKK-HKT return and KUL-JOG DPS-KUL and liked their modern fleet punctuality and cabin comfort. What I dislike is their online-booking system that tries to sell various add-ons that may or may not be useful. This also results in the prices not being transparent and I ended up paying more than anticipated.,0
I travelled with Cebu Pacific on 1 Feb 2015 from MNL-USU and on 3 Feb 2015 from USU-MNL in the afternoon and from MNL-SIN in the evening. I was worried after reading all the negative reviews about CP as it was my first time travelling with them and deliberately gave myself a long layover (about 5hrs) btw my return flight from USU and then to SIN on the same day. I pleasantly surprised when I travelled with them. I did a web check-in and got to the check-in counter 2hrs before flight time. Ground crew was friendly and polite. Flight left on time for MNL-USU and there was only a 15 min delay from MNL-SIN. Seats are typically what you find on a budget air. Didn't eat so can't comment on the food. Good thing CP is at Terminal 3 as I could eat do a massage and shop a bit during my layover. Would fly with them again.,0
"I had booked my flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur via Manila for my next holiday trip in October 2017. A month later they cancelled my flight from MNL-KUL without notice or send email to me but I found out by manage my booking. I have called them from the Netherlands to Manila with this problem and long queue waiting to get to talk with human. Finally I decided to get full refund and I have to call over and over again to get DCN number and my phone cost over 100 euro with this stupid thing. Again they keep postpone and finally told me that refund was credit back to my bank credit card since 14 February 2017. Anyway My credit card company still resisting that they have no any order or refund back. So I contact to then via phone, email, twitter, Facebook with to them and they said that they already made refund so now on is depend on my bank not with then anymore. So I called to bank and ask them to check again and bank still insisting that have no refund. So if you would like to get any refund with this airlines you will totally get nothing and made you more frustrated.",1
"Yogyakarta to Kulua Lumpur with AirAsia. There was no pre-departure announcement made by the captain. The flight departed as scheduled and arrived 20 mins ahead of schedule. Flight was smooth except for slight turbulence a few minutes prior to descent. The captain gave 2 announcements, one while cruising and one before descent. Flight was nearly full. Cabin was clean and cabin staff were attentive to passengers' needs. The aircond was working well.",0
"Out of the latest 10 times I had to fly with Cebu Pacific, 9 of them had at least 1 hour delay. The staff constantly makes updates with delay after delay and you always hear the same thing ""out of airline control"". When you are delayed to for example Manila and you see Air Asia and PAL flying on time with ease and you had the bad taste by choosing Cebu Pathetic and will sit through delay and delay, lost bags, incompetent staff and dirty airplanes.  I have given Cebu Pacific chance after chance and ironically they always state after a delay ""We hope we can make it up to you on your next flight"".  Last time flying with Cebu Pacific and will rather pay higher prices.",1
Sydney to Singapore return. First the positives: the planes were well maintained the FAs were friendly the food was basic but fine and I did not mind paying extra for the frills. Now the negatives: the seats were uncomfortable the legroom was poor (I'm 6 ft 6 so an exit row seat in economy would have been better) the movie selection was dreadful the FAs were inexperienced and the 2.10 am departure time from Singapore to Sydney is a killer. It was an overall charmless experience which was not offset by the admittedly competitive price.,1
"Cebu Pacific have a new policy of doing a 'security check' as you board the plane. Basically, Cebu Pacific staff will make you tip out your water bottle at the gate, under the guise of 'security'. (This is after the aviation security have done a proper search including x-rays, and you've refilled your bottle from the filtered water in the lounge). I asked if they will be replacing the water - they said ""you can buy it on the plane"". So they're delaying everyone, invading everyone's privacy, so they can make a few pesos selling bottled water on the plane. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. Avoid this airline.",1
"My umpteenth flight with IndiGo in the past four years, almost always Bangkok-Pune-Bangkok via Calcutta. As always exemplary cabin service, efficient check in service. This time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb: I checked in and was asked if I had a PowerPac in my luggage and I said no. While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board! A exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an IndiGo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal. Many many thanks. On the downside, no Foreigner Arrival Cards on board the flight from BKK to Cal and no Thai immigration forms on the flight from Cal to BKK.",0
Adelaide to Melbourne. Hadn't even got on the flight yet and was immediately regretting choosing to fly with jetstar. Staff where horrible and condescending. Was reluctant to help you check out bags but as soon as it came to weighing the they were straight over I can only presume thats because they saw a cash grab opportunity. Most airlines let you have a on board bag and a handbag we were made pay $50 each. The staff were Like a gang of mean girls and have left a very sour taste in my mouth will never fly with them again !,1
"Check in was easy, both flights were on time and luggage arrived without incident. That was the best of it. Every announcement was screamed at us in multiple languages. They woke the whole plane up with 2.5hrs to go (scheduled landing at 0330hrs) so they could serve breakfast to about three passengers. You can't bring water on board, and you pay for it on the plane. The passengers were generally pushy and rude. KLIA is a filthy dump and we will avoid flying Air Asia again to ensure we don't have to transit there in future.",1
"Solid airline for locals. I avoided it until they had a very good prices to fly domestically. However, felt the warm flight staff, seats aren't as small as other domestic flights. I am very happy with the flight itself. I think what they could improve on is the website side and helping people claim their vouchers",0
Flew from Bangkok (BKK) to Jakarta (CGK) on 27th June this year 2012. Paid for the trip by credit card now you have pay for the processing of the transaction. Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline. Air Asia when they first started out were a good low cost airline and value for money but they have declined dramatically the prices have gone up and everything connected with the airline has gone down. I won't fly with them again!,1
"Manila to Davao, on a Cebu Pacific A330. Seat configuration was all economy class in a 9-across (3-3-3) seat layout, and I had the last row by the window which was 2-3-2 config. Flight was boarded on time and despite being a busy flight, it flight left on time and arrived on time with great views from the clear sky. Flight price was cheap which was why I chose it but added advantage that everything went smoothly left a favourable impression of Cebu Pacific.",0
"I recently booked and flew Scoot  and had unbelievably poor service. Having booked and paid for my ticket several months in advance, I was most surprised to receive an email about two weeks out from my flight advising that my sector from Singapore to Melbourne had been replaced by a Singapore Airlines charter. The email contained several links for various responses. As I had booked and paid for an extended legroom seat to mitigate a back complaint that I suffer from, I was concerned when I read that all pre-booked anything such as seats, meals or other services had simply been cancelled. When I tried contacting Scoot, none of the links worked. I tried emailing on several occasions, but all my inquiries went unanswered. I eventually tracked down some phone numbers to their call centre, but all my calls went unanswered. When I eventually arrived in Singapore from Europe, I finally had success on the day before the flight from Singapore to Melbourne and managed to get through on a local number. I was then informed that the Scoot call centre had no visibility of the flight and could not provide any assistance, despite being the same call centre to contact that had been mentioned in the original flight cancellation email. When I got to the airport, I found that I was going to be jammed into a middle seat in economy class. Apparently, the extended leg room seats had been auctioned off and as I hadnt been able to make contact, I missed any opportunity to make representation to secure the seat that I had already booked and paid for! After a lengthy stoush at the counter where I had to be quite assertive to achieve an audience with a supervisor, I was finally successful in at least getting an aisle seat. Clearly, they were not happy with being taken to task as on the trip home the cabin crew made sure that any part of my body (I am 63) that slightly protruded into the aisle was deliberately bumped as they went past. They were rude and aggressive when I protested their actions. When I left the aircraft, I was in considerable pain from the cramped seating I had endured and required pain killers for the next two days. My recommendation: under no circumstances fly Scoot as they do not provide the flights or seats that they advertise, have no empathy for customer health needs, are deceptive, mendacious, rude, aggressive and clearly have no interest or intention of providing any reasonable level of customer support or service. Despite their written assurance that I will receive a refund for the seat that I paid for, to date I have not received a cent, so add dishonest to the list as well.",1
We flew Scoot Biz from SYD-SIN on 5th of Jan and found it a very comfortable flight. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. I read up beforehand on their website that IFE wasn't available on their IPads so I brought my own so that you can just live stream movies from their system. Seats were wide enough and recline was ok for a sleep with very good head rests the only complaint is there is no space between armrests so it's just like in economy where there isn't enough room for your arm and the person next to yours. Only 1 drink and meal included but the beers were reasonably priced at $4 AU but water was expensive at $3AU. Flight was on time and check in a breeze through the dedicated Biz counter. Boarding was good with a separate biz boarding so we were first. Pilot was down to earth and entertaining. It was definitely the most comfortable flight I've had to Singapore and will travel with Scoot again.,0
"Athens to Melbourne via Singapore. Scoot brought forward our flights by 5 days! This cut our holiday short and we lost money on our accommodation and holiday! I heard that this was a problem with Scoot so I had left a few days buffer. Not 5 days! They could not book us a new flight until 5 days after the original flight. Customer service over the phone was robotic with long periods of ""please hold"".",1
"Standard red-eye Adelaide-Melbourne flight. Chose the starter plus option upon booking for $30 extra, which allows for several extras, including a $5 voucher to use during cabin service. Crew were very friendly and attentive, and overall a fantastic 58-minute flight.",0
AirAsia Philippines is the worst airline I have ever flown with we were flying from Cebu to Manila and back. The boarding process was a disaster with everybody wanting to go in at the same time and nobody tried to even control the flow of passengers. At check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26. For a fee they could change seats - this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row. The person who checked us in acted as if he was tired and doing all he could.,1
June 7 2014 AK6110 KLIA2 - Penang. Boarding was ok although I didn't hear a call. The seat was small little leg room. It is ok for the short flight.,0
DXB-MNL-LGP-MNL-DXB flew outbound leg on 25-DEC-2013. My review would focus more on reliability of this airline. In MNL I had immediate connection to LGP with only about 1.15 hrs to catch the flight including immigration formalities. A slight delay in DXB would mean missing my flight. However thanks to Cebu Pacific for their timely departure from DXB and arriving 15 mins. early in MNL - could have been earlier without the usual traffic congestion in MNL. I was able to catch my flight to LGP with one day to prepare for my sister's wedding. Return flight was the same - on time.,0
"Staff could be nicer to customers instead of yelling. There are some people who do not fly often and are not familiar with the rules, so be considerate of that and tell them what they are doing wrong instead of being rude.",1
"I was in India on a holiday and I decided to fly with IndiGo from Mangalore to Mumbai. The ground staff and the cabin crew were really helpful and welcoming. The in-flight meal options were limited but it was a standard domestic flight like menu so no complaints there. The flight was tidy and the journey was very comfortable. The best part about the flight was the punctuality. Overall it was an excellent experience and if I would need to travel by a domestic flight in India the next time, I know which airline I am going to look out for.",0
"My good seat given away, and thrown down the back of the plane, 80% Extra Transfer fee to another flight, not telling people that no-one except essential services can enter Queensland now, a police escort on the next flight out of Queensland, with a ticket fee one third extra. $120. Cab fee and $450.",0
I fly to Darwin to visit my 6 year old grandson every 3 months. His anticipation is beyond description as he counts down the number of sleeps till I arrive. Last night he went to bed expecting me there for cuddles this morning. My Jetstar flight was cancelled via txt msg 2 hours before boarding and next flight option is a 15+ hour journey via southern states - 2 x 5 hour flights in the wrong direction plus hang around airport waiting for the privilege of flying with them. My new flights are Wednesday which means I lose 2 days of my holiday with my grandson.,1
"Flew Hobart to Sydney direct yesterday. Booked this flight as it was direct and left at a convenient time for us. We paid for a flexible ticket meaning we had baggage included, and could select our seats. Check in was easy - we were early to the airport but it was no dramas for them to send our bags off. No entertainment but only a 1 hour 45 min flight. Food and drink available for purchase but I had my own snacks. The exit row was comfy with extra leg room. Flight left only about 5 minutes late and arrived on time. Jetstar is fine for short haul domestic flights, I've never had any issues with them.",0
"We had to face a serious issue with our connecting flight from Kolkata to Delhi. We checked in along with our luggage around 2am in the morning for our 6.05am flights to Delhi. However, unfortunately, we still missed our flights.We walked in when the flight status was still showing as ""boarding"", there were no last/final call shown on the flight status. We were not let to board because we were ""3 mins late"" for boarding. We were unaware that the CCU airport is a silent airport as other Indigo flight boarding were announced since we were listening intently awaiting our boarding call. We saw the last bus standing and we pleaded to let us in, the woman officer wanted us to let in but the male officer was arrogant and said no. The moment they heard that we are foreigners, they realized their mistake but they did nothing to correct it or help us out in any manner. They took the time to send back our luggage instead. Finally, we had to get fresh new tickets from another airlines that cost us Rs 5,900 additionally. Other than this incident, our entire flight experience was good. I hope that this matter is looked into and taken care of.",1
"I wasn't really surprised at the 1-hour delay of my Manila to Cebu flight with Cebu Pacific, since it was out of Manila, but I was a bit disappointed at the lack of clear information provided. I booked the best seat in the plane and paid extra for it as there was no business class available. I'd say the extra 200 Php was worth it given that the plane was packed and the extra leg room was well-appreciated. The flight was alright and since they turned the airline into a ""budget"" airline there really wasn't much to it. It was a short flight so I didn't mind too much.  Don't bother looking for more though as all domestic airlines and flights are ""budget"" versions now. I would choose this airline over the others again though.",0
My Daughter and I flew Singapore to Perth 3 weeks ago. My Daughters baggage was over by 5 kgs so the check-in lady allowed her to remove heavy items and take on board as hand luggage which was great. Knowing that there was no entertainment we had a book and magazines to read and had a snooze. We bought subway at the airport and took it on board to eat. The flight attendant told us it was not allowed but to quickly eat it - which we did. We had no issues with the seats the flight was early arriving into Perth which we were pleased about. All in all a great flight which we could not fault and would definitely fly Scoot again for a cheap flight of $192.00 each.,0
"Bought a through ticket from Yahukimo via Jayapura to Jakarta with only 30 minutes time to change. The flight from Yahukimo left almost an hour late, and despite rushing, they closed the boarding gate for the Jakarta flight before I could get on. That was not surprising. However, Lion Air staff at Jayapura tried to blame missing the connection on me (despite their first flight being an hour late) and insist that I buy a new ticket to Jakarta! It took almost an hour of arguing to get them to rebook me for next morning's flight at no cost. Other than this issue, both flights were uneventful.",1
This has been the last time I have booked on this airline. Flight to Sydney canceled 5 min before boarding. Current flight delayed twice. Its is not a reliable service and if you need to be somewhere on schedule Never never never use this airline.,1
"Singapore to Kalibo via Cebu. We are utterly disappointed with the service and food options on our flight from Singapore to Kalibo and Kalibo back to Singapore! While we were flying to Kalibo, we have ordered some food on Scoots menu but we were informed rudely by the cabin crew that it was out of stock. And when we return back to Singapore after four nights, the same food choice was out of stock again. When we asked the crew why is that so and he said that it was due to the food choice being only available on flights from Singapore to Kalibo - which is blatant lie! - because we flew the exact said route four nights ago and were told that it was out of stock. Disappointed! You guys at Scoot need to renew the on-flight menu and educate your crew members!",1
"Jetstar cancelled the departing flight within a few hours of scheduled departure time. We lost a nights accommodation, transfers and meals. Jetstar refuse to compensate the minimal amount they offer as they stated ""they will not compensate for pre-booked accommodation""- service was appalling and live chat was disconnected when challenged as the reason why they would not compensate for lost accommodation.",1
I'm not sure what people are expecting when flying with a low cost airline. My trip Bali - Singapore was great maybe having average expectations when booking helped. I made a point of reading the fine print on the Air Asia website which saved me money by pre-booking my luggage and my seat first row of the plane. I was also happy to have paid for the meet and greet option as there were long check-in queues at 05.00 with 3 Air Asia flights departing early. No queue for me right to the front and then assisted with passport control and led to the business lounge (the lounge was pretty poor not Air Asia's fault). Crew were young polite and efficient. Well- done Air Asia!,0
"Missed the flight as the plane took off 10 min before departure time. No announcement, no warning. Just because they can. Then, when trying to re book, most of the staff were extremely short, rude, with an attention span of 3 seconds. The gate number printed on the boarding pass, was of a non existent gate. Yes, you've read correctly. Added to stress. Gate number shows up on the board 10 min before gate closes. Hired a vehicle while booking the flight, to find out at the car rental company that the charge is double and Jetstar hid that information. What a horrible service. Never again",1
"Bangkok to Singapore. Most horrible airline ever. Reached the boarding gate 5 minutes late and the staff was unhelpful in trying to help me check in and argued with me about being 5 minutes late. I must admit I was at fault for being late, I felt that the staff made no effort to help and was rude. Lousy service. Definitely not book a scoot flight again.",1
"Jakarta to Bali. Despite the dire reviews, my wife and booked flights from Jakarta to Bali with this airline. Flight departure time was supposedly 5.55pm. At 5.25pm, the posted boarding time, nothing happened. Passengers shuffled their feet hopefully, then at 5.40 an announcement came. Due to operational reasons the flight would be delayed by 2 hours! So we went back through security and got something to eat. Then 1.5 hours later, we negotiated security again and arrived at the gate - and there was a further 1 hour delay. But the man behind the desk couldnt even guarantee that and so we left and caught a taxi back home, weekend ruined. Thanks you Lion Air, we shall not book a fight with you ever again. I knew this review will make no real difference to the shoddy way they treat their passengers, but if just one person decides not to book with them and instead goes with Garuda (like we should have done) then my job here is done.",1
"I booked a flight with them from Auckland to Christchurch on 31st August and back from Queenstown to Auckland on 9th September. The first flight was cancelled due to coronavirus alert level3. Just to let you know, Air New Zealand kept their flights going so why have Jetstar cancelled? The answer is the company don't want to loose money and don't care about their customers. Believe me, the reasons is not Covid19. Instead of giving me a refund, Jetstar just offered me a voucher (still haven't received anything yet). Because it's really important for me to go I decided to pay $300 to go with Air New Zealand. Today is 4th September, and surprise Jetstar cancelled the return flight (we are now on level 2 and Air New Zealand keep their flights going). What do Jetstar want to offer me? Of course one more voucher because they don't want to give me back my money! So now I'm stuck in the South Island and my only option is to go back with Air New Zealand paying an extra $400. So because this company is not serious at all I lose almost $700. If they would like to take care of their customers they will refund straight away the money and plan things in advance. But nope, they don't care at all. Believe me, this company just care about money and if they can take advantage of you they will. Do not lose your time and money with them and use a serious company.",1
"Flight cancelled many times, they now didn't add customer service call. Even they have AVA but its harder to some people to reach the staff, can't refund money unless you agree to convert it into credit account.",1
Me and my wife were travelling to Bangalore from Goa on 8th May 6E 281. The check-in agent noticed my wife is pregnant and was very helpful. She changed us to more comfortable seats and offered to check-in our carry on luggage. We are very happy with this sweet gesture and is much appreciated.,0
"Flight was delayed several hours due to strong wind on the day and then aircraft problems. However, staff were very professional and very helpful even though theyve been working 12 hour shift. Lavatory were clean. Smooth take-off and landing.",0
"I flew with my family from Delhi to Guwahati. Indigo crew were super friendly and the flight was pretty comfortable. Service was good and attendants responded to requests, although the aircraft was nearly full. One of the hostess was nice enough and very professional, she actually made small talk with me about their service. Their smiling face and nice humor made our travels much more pleasant.",0
Melbourne - Launceston. Staff rude and not interested in passengers. No boarding call made and had to run to gate after hearing the final boarding call. Plane delayed further as they hadn't fuelled the aircraft. Seat pitch very poor and seat uncomfortable. Hardly any legroom. Food and Beverages ok. Just like any other airline same old food. I would not recommend Jetstar.,1
Just flew Coolangatta - Singapore return Scoot Biz for the third time in two years and as usual excellent for the cost. Flight left and arrived on time both ways cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food is pretty ordinary but have never eaten anything worth talking about on any airline in 50 years of flying. Cabin is clean and seats comfortable excellent value for money. People who complain really need to look at what their saving.,0
"Jammu to Delhi. When LCC in Indian domestic route is concerned Indigo is my first choice and they are improving day by day. Last travelled August last week. Was traveling with only hand baggage so used check in kiosk for boarding pass, boarding started before time and so as departure  seats are okay, food and non alcoholic beverages are available on payment, courteous and helpful crew,. Arrived on time, a good experience.",0
Flight from Changi to Sydney now 5 hours late and keeps being shifted backwards. Staff smug and disinterested. Will never fly Scoot again.,1
"Seoul to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia has terrible customer service and tries to overcharge passengers at every turn. I purchased 2 25 kg checked bags, but at check in, they claimed I had only purchased one, which resulted in by baggage being 11 kg over the weight allowance that I purchased. They then offered to check the remainder of my luggage for 42,000 won per kg, or 1.5 times the cost of my original ticket. They wanted 640,000 won for my 11 kg of checked luggage which they falsely claimed that I had not purchased. I am never flying AirAsia again.",1
"Sydney to Singapore. I've traveled with Scoot many times and I understand this is a budget airline and there are many things that are not great about their services even as a budget airline. but the worst thing, in my opinion, about this airline is that because its a cheap options, they feel justified to mistreat people. I was unable to do check in online, and I have no idea why because no information is provided. I show up to the airport, there is a huge line because there are only 2 counters open, and there are 3 staffs there doing nothing just watching their phone. I tried to approached them asking if we have to wait in such a long quote even if we dont have any luggage with us (I actually waited for 2-3 mins with a big distance behind the counter until one of the attendants made eye contact and then asked the questions). She was really not trying to be helpful and wanted to get rid of me saying its my fault I didnt check in online. But I tried and couldnt, Can you explain why?, with a really bad tone she said I dont know what is the issue with your device, lots of other people could!! So I just said youre not being helpful but thanks and walked away while I heard her saying and youre rude and shouldnt be helped! Excuse me?? The whole time I didnt changed my tone, I didnt ask for something unreasonable or said anything rude to you. just asking if people without luggage should also wait in line and trying to understand why we couldnt check online. Scoot staff think because its a budget airline, they can treat people however they want and they are not held accountable to anything. And thats just despicable.",1
Delhi to Jaipur. My flight was rescheduled without information and staff was rude. I was a regular traveller but this incident ruined my day and no initiative by the staff to satisfy the customer. I had an important meeting which was missed. Would never travel with indigo again,1
"Terrible experience! The airline delayed my morning flight from Denpasar to Jakarta by 4 hours and did not notify me. They do not even tell me about the delay at the check-in counter. I figure it out by looking at the time on the boarding pass! I reason with them that if I take this flight Ill miss my connection to Kuala Lumpur. They dont seem to care at all. All they kept saying was if youre not happy, well provide a refund. Nobody even moves a needle to help a customer out. I had to run from pillar to post to cancel my ticket, book another flight and obtain my refund. Horrible airline. They should be banned!",1
"One of worst hospitality. On 19/11/2023 flight is delayed for 2 hrs, no announcement or any information on delay. Staff at terminal gates does not have any idea on delay and are not ready to provide any proper information. They are just chilling out and avoiding customers. They are not ready to provide their superior number or call him to the gate. They are simply saying you can send an email on delay or else can go to the main counter for further information.",1
"The single worst airline experience of my life. This airline is a joke. Absolute disgrace to abandon passengers in Manila airport with no food, water or information! Would definitely have not booked had I known this is how they treat passengers",1
20th Apr 2014 Perth-Kuala Lumpur flight D7233. 18th Oct 2014 Kuala Lumpur-Perth flight D232 in Business Class. Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline but the seat does all the work thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class. Aircraft clean and crew very helpful.,0
SRG-KUL. Check in at Semarang airport was very messy and immigration was slow. Plane arrived early and at around 9am we took off. The meal that I ordered was delicious and the crew was very friendly towards the passengers. Don't expect too much from a low cost airline but at least the service offered by air Asia is good value for money highly recommended.,0
"Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu in October 2016. All flights were cancelled due to the supertyphoon, we got offered to get a refund of the flight. I filled in the form the same day, now like 3.5 months later my refund is still in progress. I got an email that I got my miles for that flight (I had to open one of those accounts at Air Asia just to check my refund status which is not nice as well), but the flights were cancelled. Bad customer service.",1
SYD-SIN. Flight was 2 hours late leaving SYD and we arrived in SIN one hour behind scheduled time. Check in at SYD was quick even with plenty of people waiting before me for check-in to open. Staff were attentive and smiling. I had a stretch seat (yellow) at the rear of the aircraft cost me an additional AUD $24. Leg room was great and seat was comfy enough. I didn't eat the airline food I took my own sandwiches. I didn't hire the inflight tablets I read a book. Drinking water was available on the flight near the toilets in the middle of the economy section. Overall for a one-way ticket that cost $240 all up I was pleased with the value for money. I would fly Scoot again if I needed to.,0
"Cebu Pacific is more realistically Cebu pathetic. Disinterested crew, hard uncomfortable seats, bus gates, dirty planes. Really it was a sad airline to have to fly with and I won't do it again.",1
"You will not get a refund at all. Bought a flight tickets with AirAsia in Jan-2020, but it got cancelled due to Covid-19. Requested for a refund back to credit card but failed, they will give excuses just not giving back the refund, instead they offered with credit account which I will never use it again.",1
MAA-TRV and TRV-BOM. Easy to use website for online booking and immediate text confirmation to my mobile. Fast courteous check in . New aircraft comfortable seats and departures ahead of schedule. FAs were all smart friendly and attentive. Great fare and an extra 600 rupees (about 7.50) got me a reserved extra legroom seat food and drink. Food was fresh excellent quality and well presented. Everything about this airline was slick and professional with an element of fun. A great experience and highly recommended.,0
"Melbourne to Launceston. At Jetstar boarding gate. Dressed T-shirt & sandals with standard 7kg carry on bag. Attendants everywhere checking baggage weight. At 7kg, all is fine. Then instructed to place computer bag from under my arm on scale. The combined weight is 10 kgs. $65.00 demanded. Having arrived from interstate on another airline an hour before with same everything, the depravity of Jetstar's business model floors. If you or your family have to risk flying Jetstar, be prepared to be shocked.  Jetstar has no concept of the fair go for customers.",1
Recently spent a week in Tasmania and traveled to and from Hobart on Jetstar Australia. I have to put my hand up and admit that my wife and I have only traveled with Jetstar once some years ago. From the outset (booking your tickets) the experience was horrendous with each separate step being asked if we wish to purchase an add on. And the number of times where we were reminded that carry on luggage that breached the weight limits (which apparently have recently been reduced) would be severely penalised and baggage placed in the hold. On our flight to Hobart passengers were called to board the aircraft then spent 20 minutes in a holding pen waiting to board. The flight left 20 minutes late. On our return journey from Hobart we arrived at the recommended 60 minutes before departure time to be told that the plane had been delayed and would be an hour late arriving which eventuality extended to two hours late arriving and departing. The cabin crew were actually OK. Not overly friendly but courteous and attentive. Overall our latest experience with Jetstar was not one that I don't intend to repeat too soon. I will pay extra for a full service airline.,1
Cebu and Singapore last month September to watch the F1 Night Race. Both flights heading towards and returning from Singapore were on time. Both also arrived at least 25 minutes ahead of schedule. Sat in premium seats up front (row 1) so leg room was definitely not a problem. Arrived in the Budget Terminal but one of the first to leave through Terminal 2 after the Budget Terminal's closure. I just wish they use the tube in Cebu when boarding. Some people tend to forget that 5J is a budget carrier hence buying everything on board the new Hot Meals being offered actually was pretty good a bit expensive but pretty tasty. Really made the cabin smell good. Only suggestion is that they could provide passengers with food trays so things don't get messy or the mess could be kept in the tray since 5J tables are pretty flimsy. Just remember to Bring a good inflight kit (Bedroom/Hotel Slippers Blanket Neck Pillow Eye shades ear plugs headset fully charged iPad and MP3 Player thick socks lip balm and probably something good to eat). All in all a pretty great experience. Cebu - Singapore flights with 5J have always been traditionally on-time.,0
"JQ 62, B787-8, 10th April 2018 (7 hrs 45 mins). I arrived about two hours before my flight and the check in process took about 50 min to complete. The immigration and security screening process took about 20 mins despite the airport being relatively busy. The Duty free shops in Ho Chi Minh airport offer competitive prices for spirits and other duty free items when compared with Australian airports. There are a limited selection of snacks and drinks by the departure gates, however they are 2-4 times the price when compared with a convenience store in the city. The flight started boarding about 40 mins before departure and the aircraft left the gate on time. I was seated in an aisle seat 34G, the Jetstar seats are charcoal leather and are relatively comfortable, however the seat pitch is only 30 inches which makes it a tight squeeze on long haul flights. Jetstar had a credit card only policy on this flight for all on-board purchases which can be problematic for those passengers without a credit card. There was good selection of new release movies, V shows and games on the IFE ($10 onboard or $9 pre booked). There are a few free TV shows available however these were predominantly short 15-20 mins fishing programs from the Top End. There were a reasonable range of snacks, hot food and sandwiches available from the on board menu although priced relatively high. It would be nice to see Vietnamese Beer (Saigon/Hanoi brands) on the beverage menu to add to Jetstars limited selection of beers on-board. The crew on the flight were friendly and helpful and dealt with some minor issues that occurred on the flight adeptly. The flight offered great views over the Australian Outback around Alice Springs, Broken Hill about 1hr+ before landing in Sydney. The flight arrived a few minutes early into Sydney, however we had to wait on the apron while an aircraft was pushed back from our assigned gate.",0
"Reading many of the reviews I must be one of the luckiest travellers. Three Cebu Pacific flights in the last few months all MNL-DVO-MNL and all close to time with no dramas. This particular Manila to Davao flight was so empty, it was not how many spare seats but how many spare rows! For the money paid I remain very satisfied with this airline.",0
"Singapore to Guangzhou with Scoot. Awful airline, pre-purchased front seat, while check in and boarding, have been reallocate to very rear seat without being informed. Feedback to customer service, their standard reply was that there was an aircraft change. I am 100% sure there was no aircraft change, since boarding ticket and booking detail were the same in flight no. and plane type. Even more terrible is they only refund after you have lodged a complaint, and was just refunded a voucher!",1
"Terrible experience from start to finish. Cheap for a reason, Paid an extra $400 due to all the flight disruptions. They delayed the first flight which meant I had to stay overnight in Manila and had to rebook my connecting flight from Dubai. They then delayed my flight in Manila by 4 hours which meant I would miss my connecting flight in Dubai again. Zero compensation or accountability, staff were laughing at me when I was clearly stressed. And paid $50 extra dollars for every extra - totally ridiculous and not worth it.",1
"I flew from BLR to BKK (Bangkok). The Indigo staff at the BLR airport were so rude, goodness knows why. Maybe it was late in the night and they hate their jobs. The flight got delayed by 1.5 hours. The seats were so uncomfortable. They passengers sitting next to me were loud and obnoxious. Most of the people who fly IndiGo are the ones who are looking for the cheapest option. Their behavior and appearance is congruent with their spending.",1
"I ordered my round-way tickets months in advance, only for them to say my return flight will be canceled one week before the actual flight. I needed to talk to someone to get more detail about the process, but no human is available as their system is now only a bot.  The system offered to move my return flight to another day but none of the proposed timing fit my schedule, so I asked for a refund. I was given a pending case confirmation, without any detail whatsoever on the refund processing.  Since I couldnt get any clarity, I decided to go down to the airport counter and asked some questions to the ground staff at the AirAsia counter.  She checked and confirmed the refund request was actually for both depart and return tickets, something that is not made clear in the bot chat. The ground staff could not void my refund request as this has to be done by AirAsia and not the airport staff. I had thought that the refund was only going to be for my return ticket but I had lost both tickets. Because of this, they couldnt guarantee that I will still have my name in the booking system on my departure date. The ground staff said theres nothing that can be done on their side as they have no way to reach AirAsia. Basically, I need to book another ticket which is way more expensive now that I have so little time left before my flight. So before you book your tickets think twice. It could just be a stroke of bad luck on my side, but Im reading so many reviews that are similar to mine and they help solidify why I will never book from this airline ever again.",1
"Singapore to Hong Kong. Terrible overall experience. Every possible excuse to charge you for things that are normally part of the ticket: its not low cost at all, and with petty rules about anything that can be charged for (check the weight of your carry on bags before you leave home!), ground staff who act like they get a percentage of any extra revenue they charge you for and no managerial presence to smooth anything over. The staff on board are fine, the food (don't buy it) is awful, the seats are tiny, i'm not that tall (under 6ft) but couldn't fit my legs in without spreading into the aisle, very uncomfortable journey. They say they are low cost, but if you have been scalped for all the extras, they are not cheap all. I do this trip roughly every month, have used pretty much all the airlines who fly it, and I wont use Scoot again.",1
"I bought a ticket Padang - Kuala Lumpur in february 2017 for a flight in August. With this flight we had 6 hours in Kuala Lumpur to catch the other flight. After a month I a got a message of a reschedule for about two hours later. It still should be enough for the transfer in Kuala Lumpur. On the day of departure when we arrived at the ariport a next reschedule of the flight. This means about two hours for transer. This is very tight for a transer in Kuala Lumpur, due to the two different terminals. We informed the AirAsia staff, they arranged a Priority luggage handling. The man took a picture of our passport and ticket and send it to Kuala Lumpur to inform the office there and probably inform the Oman Air counter, our connecting carrier. Finally, at the gate we waited for three hours to found out that the flight was delayd for almost an hour! The plane had a fast and smooth trip to Kuala Lumpur. At arrival we ran to the luggage band, picked up our luggage as first and run to the next terminal. At the second terminal we found out that the connecting flight of Oman-Air has left already.  The result was that I had to buy 4 new tickets to Amsterdam. Back home filling in the e-form and ask for help or compensation. But the only response of Air Asia, sorry we are not responsible. We can not be charged for costs due to delay or rescheduling. This means that you cannot trust AirAsia if you have a connecting flight. If you cannot trust the schedule you better don't fly with AirAsia.  Im sorry because the flight and onboard service is okay. The lesson is that a cheap ticket can turn to be very expensive.",1
"Auckland to Christchurch with Jetstar. Using kiosk to obtain a boarding pass and went direct to gate after security check. Early morning flight extremely full, cabin crew professional but not so friendly. A surprise is that the captain greeted each passenger when we disembarked.",0
"The airline cant even inform you anyway through texts or emails if a flight has been cancelled. Called customer service and when it was something they didn't understand, they automatically transfer you mid sentence while you are talking and then you have to wait 10 -20 minutes for a new operator.",1
Forget Scoot. They cancelled the flight three weeks before and have not refunded even after 6 mails and 3 months waiting for them paying the money back. I had to pay 100 Euro more and had some stress for searching and booking via another airline and they even do not pay me the money for the original ticket of their cancelled flight. You cannot trust them.,1
Had day from hell arrived at the check in late due to road crashes on the way to Sydney. We were met by a great receptionist who was very sympathetic to all the late arrival people. We were quickly transferred to the next available flight and the holiday was not spoilt. Thank you Jetstar Airways.,0
"I am representing a party of 5 seniors traveling from Medan back to Kuala Lumpur after a 4D3N tour on Mar 14/24, and we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Mr Ruly (Guest Service Officer) of Air Asia at the Medan International Airport Checkin counter desk. Mr Ruly was very pleasant and polite , and quickly booked us a flight back to KL the same day , after our flight on Batik Airline was suddenly cancelled without notice. He went out of his way to help us obtain a flight cancellation letter from Batik Airline at the airport. Further he also helped us saved money in advising us that we could combine the weights of all our check-in luggage, so our overall ticket cost is cheaper. It is not often that you meet nice people like this, especially one who is efficient and served with a warm smile. Our flight back to KL was pleasant, and we arrived 25 mins ahead of schedule! Again not many airlines can match this. Overall we were all very pleased with experience.",0
"I booked a flight to Manila to Surigao and as soon as I arrived at the airport the flight got delayed. When I arrived to my destination, I was later informed that my luggage was left behind due to too much weight capacity in the airplane. Not only did they fail to inform me before regardless of the delay of the plane, they also made it so that we, the passengers, had to adjust to the timing of when our baggage was going to arrive despite our completely packed schedule. I don't recommend flying here.",1
Flight: In last month. Travelled CNS to KIX return in Business Class. Service was ok. However the cabin team leader had a bit of an attitude problem. My wife's side of the plane go to choose bread types etc while I had the team leader giving service and you got what you were given. After meal was served crew were scarce and spent time gossiping in galley. The thing that irritated me the most was the fact people were allowed children on their knee in business who screamed thru the whole trip. As far as I'm concerned you pay the extra for piece and quiet. I have travelled this service 6 months previously and thought the service had dropped since then. Although the fares were very cheap I would rather pay more and receive superior child free service.,1
"Pretentious and unprofessional. We generally avoid Scoot but for this routing the timing and fare were the best combination we went ahead. Most important: we arrived on time and safely, and so did the luggage, so no complaints about that. But in general this airline is really annoying to fly. Their business class doesn't even have paper towels in the bathrooms - you can dry your hands on facial tissues. No blankets - unless you want to pay $15. (Oh, and though it's a Singapore based airline they charge for extras in USD - because they are bigger.) No entertainment - not even screens. Seats recline somewhat. Food varies from not bad to quite mediocre. Service is officious and rigid - even when there were only ten people in the business class cabin they couldn't bring themselves to be flexible on mealtimes. Everything is about the rules, nothing is about the passengers. I don't think that's the fault of the crew - it is probably the management. Trying to check in on line from Tokyo was impossible because the website - whether the JP website or the SIN website - only supplies Singapore as a point of departure, there are no other choices. Condescending - the pilot refers to the staff as ""our Scootees"" - as if they are owned property. It's basically a run-of-the-mill low-cost airlines with pretensions. I wouldn't say avoid at all costs; I would say expect a quality of service and professionalism a little below AirAsia and you will probably get what you are looking for.",1
Travelled Perth to Singapore return. Excellent price for return flights. All aspects of the flight were exceptional - easy and quick check in boarding quick and flight comfortable. All flights on time. Staff very helpful and friendly.,0
Both flights (Brisbane to Darwin and Darwin to Singapore) boarded and left on time. The seats were comfortable and I managed to get some sleep on both flights. I did not feel squashed. There was no onboard entertainment. I had an iPad with pre-loaded movies but I would have been prepared to pay a little extra for the option to access inflight entertainment onboard. I pre-paid for baggage and food vouchers so I had no issues with overweight hand luggage.,0
"We got very cheap tickets so weren't expecting much. Plane was clean and departure on-time. For an international flight the plane was setup like a domestic flight is no blanket, pillow. Seats were hard and thin. We preordered our meals which were delivered with a smile from the crew. I'd be inclined to pack snacks and drinks as the selection available is pretty uninteresting. The entertainment was really good however the headsets were cheap and nasty earbuds. You couldn't hear over the noise if the plane. We put our noise cancelling headsets over them to make it bearable. Flight was easy and no problems at either boarding or landing. Luggage had to be correct weight. 20 kg and 7kg for hand. Much prefer USA southwest 2bags X 23 kg free plus 7 hand or American USA we used for further flights into USA. Jetstar is ok however they just give you a seat .. you need to either buy what other airlines give free or supply it yourself.",0
"Had no problem with fees, checkin, carryons, food or fees. Food was good and much better than United and Hawaiian. Luggage fees were fine and very clear up front. The quiet section (no children or movies) was great but has no way to charge electronic devices so bring batteries. I recommend you bring your own water and snacks as these are rather expensive onboard. My main complaint is the temperature of the cabin  nears 80 degrees F so rather hot for US passengers, seems norm for Asian passengers. Bring water! Easy to press light and flight attendant call buttons on arm rests. Watch out! Love those windows you can lighten and darken. Going to try Air Asia next!",0
"The staff at the counter appeared disinterested in providing good customer service. She did not greet me with a welcoming attitude, and  questioned why do I have so many luggage which I had only 2 bags with me instead of 1 bag. They made me pay for the extra luggage. Seats were also badly allocated regardless was it a full flight or not, while we checked in together. So insensitive of separating couples sitting with others couple's partner instead of having a couple in pair sitting together. I wrote in to Zipair on 31 Oct pertaining this matter via email & yet to receive any response from them. I was booked with SQ for a better returning experience.",1
"We already experienced several inconvenient situations with this airlines such as delayed flights, boarding changes to name a few. But this Manila to Singapore flight we have is the worst. The day before our flight, our schedule was changed. We paid more for the schedule we took but you scheduled us to the cheaper priced schedule which has very inconvenient time for us thus we did not take it. Our important appointment was cancelled because of this. We called their contact center but we were answered after 1 hour of waiting on the line. We travelled quite a number countries already and experienced different budget airlines and I will say that this airlines is the worst.",1
"Hobart to Melbourne. If you value your time more than money do not fly with Jetstar. Getting a flight on time is as common as spotting a unicorn. I had the displeasure to fly with them 4 times this year. My yearly record is delayed 2 hours, delayed 1hr, cancelled (no refund and not even a voucher) and today I am delayed 3 hours (for now!). I would highly recommend flying with other companies, at least as a push to improve their service. It is a pity that their parent airline Qantas does not push for improvements. I hope another budget airline decides to open shop in Australia, would be great to have some tougher competition to raise those terrible standards.",1
"Bangkok to Tokyo. Ive flown many low cost airlines before, but they still served meals, offered beverages, and just had more general information. The flight attendants were there for no reason because they dont even go down the aisle once even for water. Theres less than ten movies to choose from for a 8 hr flight. The customer service is absolutely terrible, not even a phone number on their website, and they never got back to any emails. On our way home from Thailand, we were denied boarding because they couldnt complete the transfer due to the check in counter because outside the terminal in Japan. We couldnt make our flight and had to buy another flight with a completely different airline. Lost over 1000$ due to this discrepancy and inability to transfer in Japan, and misinformation.",1
"This was a morning flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The flight was nearly full and departure was not as scheduled, it was at most 10 mins. late. The flight was generally smooth, and landing was good. Even though we departed late, the plane arrived on time. This time, I didn't ordered any food as I remembered my bad experience with the food on my last flight.",0
This is the second daily scheduled from Bandar Lampung to Jakarta. We took a few minutes behind schedule but arrived on time. The flight was generally smooth. Take-off and landing was okay. The cabin crew were attentive to passengers' needs. The bus service from the tarmac to the terminal was also efficient.,0
"This has been the absolute worst flight experience I have ever had, and I fly a lot. Not only was my flight cancelled last minute (while I was sitting at the gate) but there was absolutely no resolution, and no customer service. I will never fly JetStar again due to how horribly this was handled. Ive had canceled flights before and I am a flexible traveler but a flight has never been cancelled less than an hour before takeoff and with no support about how to get to my final destination. I have been screwed out of thousands of dollars because I cant get to my destination or get any reimbursement or refunds on accommodations. The woman helping on the phone was not helpful and wanted me to fly to a different part of the country to somehow arrive at my destination an entire 24 hours later and thought this made sense. She refused to allow my to talk to anyone else and said I had to cancel my flight and basically figure everything out myself. Other airlines are so much more helpful and understanding but JetStar is absolutely horrible. No one would help in person either, it honestly felt like a practical joke because I dont understand how an airline can successfully operate like this. I will not be a return customer.",1
"Bombay to Ahmedabad return I have long admired Indigo for it's focus on providing on-time service at a decent price with seats which are reasonably comfortable. I never minded paying the fee for better seats in the first row or exit row or for food which is against decent and I recommended it to many. However after a gap of over a year, I flew Indigo again and found the seats so thin, and the fares were not that decent compared to some carriers.",1
Tokyo Narita to Bangkok booked for 6th March. I put in a request for a full refund as AirAsia cancelled my flight. They advised me to wait 30 days for the refund. It is now over 30 days and still no refund.,1
"Overall a fine flight experience. The worst part of flying with Scoot was that I was overcharged $70 on my inflight purchase and have been chasing this up since October last year. I have had no updates (not a single email or phone call) sent to me about the status of refund, the customer service team show no skill at fixing this issue and the last staff member I spoke to over the phone had an attitude and was completely unhelpful. Apparently there was also a problem with the process as they didnt have the cardholders name and I only found out about this through multiple calls to them. Fine to fly with but I wouldn't wish try to chase up any issues with them. Would not recommend. Worst customer service experience and problem resolution I've ever had.",1
The worst airline I have ever dealt with. They would not allow me to book a pre-flight bag and then charged me $80 for a bag that was slightly overweight (10 kilos). I had no choice but to pay as I was on the way to the flight. They were totally disinterested in helping. Terrible experience all around.,1
"Can someone buy Air Asia a Timepiece? SGN to KUL late 22/7. KUL to Pen late 24/7. Pen to KUL late reschedule. KUL to SGN late. AK526 was late for my hospital appt, 55mins reschedule. I arrived back exhausted. I nearly missed my last train, had to run. The worst part of this, they don't care how this impacts on peoples lives. One particular customer facing person at Penang was rude. Luckily the Cabin Staff far more helpful.",1
Travelled from Singapore to Gold Coast in Scootbiz and was disappointed that the inflight entertainment was down. Cabin crew said since we have paid for it we can call Scoot when back home and asked for refund. The food was horrible I ordered chicken in dark sauce with rice but the rice was so soft like glutinous rice and was very salty. On the flight back from Gold Coast to Singapore yesterday there was inflight entertainment but was after several attempts to log in and with friendly cabin crew's help. I thought it was free for Scootbiz passengers but I was actually charged SGD16 for it! The cabin crews on board were very unprofessional. When we landed at Singapore Changi Airport when waiting for baggage claims the group of Scoot cabin crews and captains were making lots of noise standing together with the passengers a rather unprofessional sight. This is my first time on Scoot perhaps the last time.,1
"Brisbane to Tokyo via Cairns. Flights booked to Japan in June 2019, I tried to cancel (with more than 2 months notice). I was Informed that they will not even give me a partial refund due to me buying the flights while they were on sale. I could understand I they charged a cancellation fee or only refunded a percentage. But I just cant understand this policy and it is upsetting as it could help me.",1
"I flew from Singapore to Melbourne (return flight) with Scoot. On both journeys there was a delay with no explanations or any compensation. From SIN to MEL, the flight departed with a 2 hour delay, around 2am. Families with babies were extremely tired at this point and not even a cup of water was offered by Scoot staff. From MEL to SIN, so far it's 3 hours of delay and counting. I will definitely avoid this company in the future and will not recommend it to anyone, especially not families, unless the one and only consideration is money. I'm used to flying low cost companies but this one is really the worst.",1
"SIN - CGK one way flight on time with new B737-900ER. Seat pitch was very tight (around 28"") - very hard to sit and move around. The 1.5hr journey was like a shuttle bus - no services and you cannot even purchase any foods or drinks. FAs were attentive as call button answered immediately.",1
Booked 4 people Business class from Honolulu to Adelaide and paid $9213 one way. Flight was cancelled that morning and we were put on a Hawaiian Airlines flight in Economy. Was late arriving in Sydney and missed our connection to Adelaide so had to book 2 hotel rooms and were booked to leave Sydney for Adelaide the next morning. Boarded the Jetstar flight at 7am and sat on the plane for 2.5 hours without even being offered a bottle of water. Spent hours on the phone and doing Live Chat just to be offered $ 250 per person. If I wanted to travel Economy I would pay for Economy. If I pay the premium to go Business class for the extra comfort I expect to receive it. If I supplied a service that was worth 25% of what I was supplied I would get arrested but Jetstar seem to get away with it. Dont fly with them. Its not worth the hassle.,1
Flew from Gold Coast to Singapore on Scoot. Check in was quick.Service was good. Slept some of the way. Will fly them again. I like leaving from the Gold Coast airport because it is an efficient small airport.,0
"For an airline that does the same routine flights several times every single day, you would think that they could get it right. Not asking for much but it would be nice to see my checked luggage that saw a total of 1.25 hours in total airtime between two flights and a three hour layover before the second flight to get my back pack from one airplane to the other one parked beside it, you would assume that it's not something you need to be able to split atoms for to get right. Furthermore, the logic of having to pay extra for overweight luggage and have it lost is astonishing. Nothing like paying to have your luggage lost by a company that does the same routine flights seven days a week dealing with everyone's luggage as well. It would be nice to see the employees actually care about these types of situations maybe by starting to make phone calls and send emails and giving you updates rather than play video games on their phones.",1
"Economy from Sydney to Singapore and ScootBiz on the way back. Overall, the flight was cheap - you get what you pay for. Bought the fares on a sale, and even with fees with checked-in luggage, it was about half the cost of a full-service airline. The seats were fantastic - especially for a low cost airline. According to Seatguru economy seats were a generous 18""-19"" wide. This is wider than many full-service airlines. Practically speaking, this could mean a difference between being able to tuck your elbows between the seat handles (instead of clashing with your neighbour's elbow) or not. Leg room was also adequate, although I am shorter than average (5'8""). The ScootBiz seat was, obviously, much more comfortable. But note that it is a Premium Economy, rather than Business offering. It involved reclining wide seats but added utility is limited because the leg rest awkwardly stops mid-calf and cuts off your circulation after a while. The major let-downs were twofold. Firstly, the appalling attitude the ground and especially call centre staff. After talking to them I felt like they were doing me a huge favour by allowing me to fly on Scoot. I get that it's a budget airline, but it doesn't cost much (if at all) to be slightly more courteous. The second is the food. You are not allowed to bring your own food, and you need to buy theirs. Not surprisingly, food is not cheap. But unfortunately, the Nasi Lamak I got was greasy and salty. Bottom line: if you're a budget traveller, they are nevertheless solid. If you're an infrequent flyer, I'd consider spending the extra money on a full-service airline.",0
"My flight was 6E 0018 on 27-SEP-2023. The flight had some issues with electric problems but the cabin crews dealt the issue with professionalism. Sabiya, the crew member was awesome and kept her cool throughout the journey and helped each and every passengers. It was a tough day but a big salute to all especially Sabiya.",0
Overall experience with Indigo flight from Delhi to Pune is good compared to others which I have travelled. Cabin space and seating arrangement is better than others. Overall ambience was pleasant. I think Indigo could enhance their service by adding some information devices inside the cabin showing a route map and if possible some outside coverage such as cameras. They could also offer Indian food during meal times rather than junk food.,0
"As a small business owner I am hyper aware of the damage caused by COVID-19 to both the hospitality and travel industries. However, the actions of Australias ""low cost"" carrier airline is almost unconscionable! Traveling with two guests we were changed an ""upgrade"" fee of $65.00 for extra baggage which weighed in at .85kg over their 7kg carry on limit. Understandably money needs to be made during these uncertain and difficult times but changing a guest $65.00 for extra baggage is an absolute joke. Myself and any persons within my business will never travel on Jetstar in Australia again. Sorry that your continued greed will loose you honest paying customers.",1
"Auckland to Christchurch with Jetstar Airways. I would rather have spent more money and reduced the chances of delay. At first an SMS said that the plan was 90 minutes late. When checking in, the flight was a further 90 minutes late. A total of three hours. I went through a period several years ago when I avoided Jetstar for similar reasons and thought they may have improved but was obviously wrong. Won't go back for a third time.",1
Flew from Delhi to Coimbatore and then from Chennai to Kolkata. This is an outstanding low-cost airline. I couldn't really find any fault with them! All staff were very friendly professional and helpful the planes were modern and spotless the captain gave informative and friendly announcements before during and after the flight the food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced; and the inflight magazine was well-produced. In Delhi we got stuck in a traffic jam caused by a sudden storm and so we only arrived at the aiport about 10 minutes before the flight. We assumed that we would miss the flight and have to make a plan B but the excellent and helpful staff quickly issued us boarding passes and rushed us to the plane so we still got away on time.,0
"Jakarta to Manila. Just got cancelled flight twice in 24 hours, spend whole night and day waiting, just to get cancelled flight again (yes right, 48 hours delays). Refund policy takes 4-6 weeks, no explanation, no staff available - all is outsourced staff, not 1 Cebu Pacific staff available, outsourced staff cannot give any definite anawer. End up losing all meetings and lost all money on booked hotels because 48 hours delays. No compensation whatsoever. Would give 0/10 if I can.",1
Only fly with this airline if you want to ruin your holiday spirit or have no other choice. I'm just hoping they file for bankruptcy soon. We all most know airlines are cash grabbing companies with bad service but this airline is on another level.,1
"Delhi to Hyderabad with IndiGo. While I'm writing this, I'm waiting to make the payment for excess luggage. The problem is, it's been 40 minutes, and having been moved from one counter to another, three times, I'm still stuck in a state wondering if I'll ever get my boarding pass for an already delayed flight. I've travelled on pretty much every domestic airline that operates in India. This is my worst experience so far. Unlikely I'll ever buy a ticket with Indigo again.",1
Indigo always amazes me with their service. The environment in the aircraft from Chennai to Mumbai is very well maintained and the crew takes care of the passengers so very well. It is definitely the best airline in India. I would always be happy to fly with Indigo Airlines.,0
SIN-PER-SIN. Both flights were on time we paid to choose our seats (basic ones) and got them. We filled our bottles with water prior to boarding and carried with us some burgers and snacks. Although they announce that food purchased from outside is not allowed to be consumed many people have a bite and no one says anything - I would recommend this option over purchasing the inflight food especially as many people have said that it is not good. We watched our own movies on our iPad so entertainment wasn't an issue either. Safety measures were taken very seriously and the cabin crew were responsive when they were called for. I would definitely recommend this airline it does what it says on the tin and at a very decent price. If you want all the frills and creature comforts beyond a nice seat safety and being on time don't go for it.,0
"Hobart to Melbourne JQ714. Supposed to travel 17 October at 2240. Booked our seats about 10 days before travel ($10 fee) and got a printout. Made the mistake of not checking in when we arrived thinking the seat booking was sufficient. So after waiting 2.5 hours to board we discovered that we did need boarding cards. The supervisor then told us it was too late numbers/names had gone to the Captain and there was nothing he could do - catch the next flight in the morning. Where do we stay? Shrug. Sent us to the Jetstar desk to register for the flight and we were told we had to pay $150 late booking fee! Asked the supervisor if he could waive the fee as we had no choice but to book late. ""No can't do that."" Airport closing soon - see you later. No attempt to help or suggest any > accommodation or anything. Found some nice people who helped us find a hotel close by - $189: not much sleep. My question is: why if we've booked and the supervisor goes through the list to make up a manifest can they not make an announcement to check if people who've booked and paid for seats are in the transit lounge? Apparently with online booking this mistake does happen from time to time. Secondly why is it so hard to just call up the Captain and request the addition of 2 more passengers - who already have booked seats? It's called 'Customer Care'. Jetstar clearly don't know what that is.",1
Early morning flight JQ823 March 4th was our first trip with Jetstar to Sydney. Check in was very quick and easy we have web checked in so just baggage drop and pick up the boarding passes. We were there nice and early to make sure we were on our flight. Boarding was on time and it was quick and efficient. Plane was nice and clean looked quite new. Seating is what I expected nice leg room and comfortable also. I was a little disappointed when it came to the prices of food. It was like $10 for a pie and drink. Drink at $3.50 was a bit pricey maybe $2.50 would have been acceptable but this is what you get for a low cost airline. We arrived in Sydney on time. Boarding off the aircraft was quick and efficient. No complaints on this leg and pick up of luggage as expected.,0
"Have a flight from Hong Kong to Puerto Princesa the 28th of April this year. When we booked the tickets we compared times and prices, and then decided to pay quite a lot more to fly home Sunday 6th of May. We did not have to wake up too early, we didnt have to spend a lot of time on the airport in Manila and we didnt have to arrive in Hong Kong too late. The flight time was perfect and worth the extra money. Then they changed our time and we ended up with 20 minutes between the connecting flights. We therefore had to change flights. In the email they stated that it could easily be done on their website. When I tried to do so it said there was no flights available and that I would have to contact them by phone. It was almost impossible to contact their customer service. I tried every number I could find and their Facebook page, but no answer. When we finally got through they could only offer us flight early in the morning where we would have to wait hours in Manila. I tried to tell them that we paid a lot more for the flight we originally had, and that the flight they were offering was cheaper on their website. Spent more than 30minutes on the phone with them asking for compensation. They told us the compensation was that we could rebook the flight free of charge. The flights they are offering us are obviously a lot less convenient, and I think its only fair that they compensate us for that. Making up for their own mistake is not a compensation, and Im really disappointed by the lack of help.",1
My partner flew Scoot on the 21/1 OOL-BKK. Flight was 5 hours late so she missed connecting flight in Singapore she was told she would have to wait 22 hours for the next flight. No refund offered no meal voucher no accommodation and no apology offered. She had to buy a ticket from SNG-BKK with Air Asia.,1
SYD-BNE JQ824. Boarding at Sydney was utter chaos since for some unknown reason we were using a Tiger Air gate far from the usual Jetstar gates which had very little seating. The Jetstar airport crew had absolutely no idea what was going on and made boarding announcements by shouting at us and ordering passengers around. The previous flight was late arriving and it was a nightmare trying to disembark and then board passengers in such a small space. The flight itself was okay but the amount of legroom was very limited making me uncomfortable. Departed 35 minutes behind schedule and arrived 25 minutes late. As Jetstar is a budget airline I was not expecting high standards however the quality was disappointing. Next time I would be more than happy to spend a little extra to fly Qantas or Virgin.,1
Bangkok to Singapore. Departed late from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi by about 20 minutes due to plane arriving late & hence arrived in Singapore late by about 10 minutes. Was seated in the emergency exit row & hence there was ample legroom but seat could not recline. Cabin crew were generally courteous and professional.,0
Sydney-Denpasar return Business class. Was glad it was only a 6 hour flight each way. The cabin crew tried hard but it seems to lack the refinement of other airlines. Crew really helpful. Seats comfortable. Avoid window seats because once the row in front reclines it's a big effort to get out. Food and wine okay. Entertainment limited with personal sets. I guess you get what you pay for. For the short trip it was worth it.,0
"Short haul budget flight from Sydney to Sunshine Coast on Jetstar Airways. The service was great, crew was friendly and cheerful - overall, nothing to complain. The return leg, I was a little sick and was given special attention from the crew.",0
"Bangkok to Krabi with AirAsia. Being a budget airline, their luggage allowance isn't great but the leg room was actually the best I'd had on a low cost economy flight. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. Also the cabin crew were friendly and courteous, overall I would recommend.",0
"Singapore to Taipei. My First trip on Scoot. Changed boarding gate at the last minute. Late departure (1.55am instead of 12.45am) Flight delayed (landed at 6.10am instead of 5.40am - usual landing not later than 5.15am). Took more than 20 minutes to exit from the aircraft (Row 43) due to the delay, I missed my 8.00am train from Taipei Main Station to Hualien.",0
Jakarta-Kuala Lumpur and Singapore-Jakarta. Check-in crews were okay. Most announcements were recorded no meal or drink. A choice of orange juice or water would be appreciated. Seat was very hard magazine onboard boring and crews weren't interested in serving passengers. The only good thing is the value of money (if you buy tickets early).,1
"The app is impossible to use and will not let you see your reservation. On the contrary it keeps telling you that it cannot find your booking.  Very strict procedure at check in regarding your luggage weight and also the carry on weight. The plane was almost full. The seats were hard and not comfortable, cramped. They don't give any water or meal free.  Don't expect any flight entertainment system there is no screen no USB port nothing at all. So if you don't have a phone with movies or a couple of books, prepare yourself for a very long boring flight in a uncomfortable seat that makes it impossible to get any good rest. Then there was the transit at Singapore airport which was okay. Singapore to Bangkok was delayed by about 1 hour on departure when everybody was sitting on the plane and waiting without information. Because you cannot use your earphones before taking off and landing , as it would endanger your security if you cannot hear what the pilot would have to say, at least was the reply when I questioned their policy. They also have you straighten the seats and there again remove your earphones 15 minutes before landing.  This was a long haul flight followed by another one that was delayed by one hour with aggressive crew members. I would never fly with Scoot again even if it means paying more.",1
"Amritsar to Singapore. I had the worst experience flying with scoot. The staff was very rude. I was travelling with a six months old toddler and instead of showing me some comfort the air hostess behaved very rudely with me. She also forced me wake up my child just so I could find the infant belt she gave me, And warned me that I am liable for the belt. Where as I told her I have not even moved from this seat how can I misplace the belt? But still she insisted on finding it and made me get up from my seat.  If I called for food she refused to give and was very loud and rude.",1
"Denpasar to Jakarta. Lion air is notorious for late flights with no information. You will not find cheaper tickets and if you are OK with waiting at the airport indefinitely then this airline could be for you! Typically flights accrue delays as the day goes on due to ""operational reasons"" which typically are late accumulated arrivals over the day. The staff is obnoxious about the delays and have heard all complaints from passengers over the years to the point that another one is but a grain of sand on a beach. Lion air, always delayed, always disappointing on everything except the price. The number of times I promised myself to pay the premium to fly anything but lion somehow got beaten again by the stated schedule.",1
"Brisbane to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways. Worst experience ever! First of all the staff are rude and do not help you at all, I got to the airport an hour and a half early, I had paid $40 for 20kg of checked luggage when I purchased the tickets and went over by 2kg so went and asked what to do. He said I had a minimum of $60 to pay so I did, less then 2 mins later a lady tells me they overbooked the plane and I didnt have a seat even though I booked months prior to our trip. They got us a seat on a Virgin plane and their baggage limit was different being 23kg per person so we absolutely did not need the extra $60 dollars worth that I spent on a different plane and airline. I went back to the man who charged us extra for a refund and he said he cant do anything so we had to go online and talk to someone else for almost an hour but she just made excuse after excuse not to just give us the refund.",1
"Brisbane to Denpasar-Bali. I have flown with Jetstar from the very beginning when I first started flying and have never had a problem until now. My first international trip was a disaster to say the least. First of all we checked in and dealt with a rude staff member who separated my sister and I on the plane because he did not speak clearly whilst asking if I would able to help with the emergency exit if it were to come to that. Because he didnt speak clearly I then said sorry? And then told me its not a joke and they take it very seriously so you cant sit together. Fair enough although I did not hear this man so I found it very irritating to seperate us based on the fact he didnt speak clear enough. After our flight we landed in Denpasar (Bali), we went to collect our luggage, stood there for an hour and my bag was no where to be found. After talking to the luggage people at the Denpasar airport, they have gave us a piece of paper and we had not heard anything else. We then put in a claim with Jetstar and waited to hear back from them, we found out our luggage had never actually left Brisbane, where we departed from. This was extremely frustrating as we were in a foreign country with no more then a couple pieces of clothes. Meanwhile waiting to hear back from Jetstar we had to spend a lot of money just to accomodate ourselves with clothes and everyday necessities. We had money, expensive clothes and undergarments in this bag. We finally heard from Jetstar 2 days into our trip saying our baggage was in Bali and they would deliver it to us at our villa. We sent our address and never heard back, here we are leaving and still dont have our luggage. We went a week without anything, we constantly emailed Jetstar to see what they would do to compensate for this massive problem and they showed no compassion or care for what has happened and have only told us to wait. Luckily a nice man at the Denpasar airport has located our luggage and has set it up on our flight back home and that is the service we wanted. Jetstar has still not done anything at all to help, fix or apologise for this entire issue. Safe to say wont be flying with Jetstar again.",1
Singapore-Bali on new 737-900. Low fare with Good Service. Seat a bit hard Food provided is enough but not nice. Return Flight delay about 50 min. Overall still satisfied with Lion Air.,1
"I could not prebook check-in luggage online for my flight from Bali to Bangkok. I called them (the first number on their website did not work, temp. out of order). They told me I either have to pay Rp 224.000 (22AU$) per kg at the airport at check-in; or I could prebook for just Rp 23000 (that is 10%) up to 6 hours before, but I can only do that at the airport. That is ridiculous! My luggage would cost more than my ticket if I would not go to the airport before and I would have no idea about that if I would not have called them. I know countries where this would be illegal.",1
"Return flight Manila to Kalibo (Boracay). First time with Cebu Pacific and everything went smoothly. Booking was very transparent and easy, flights on time, clean planes, professional and friendly staff. My over-sized sport equipment was tagged as fragile and delivered without damages. Low cost business model at it's best! Strongly recommended.",0
"Business Class from Sydney to Denpasar on Jetstar. Its a shame I didn't book the return leg instead. The 1720 departure meant a relatively late arrival in Denpasar, but dinner was served. The meal was impressive. I did not mind the seats being somewhat firm, given we were in the first row, but the foot rest and limited recline meant some moving around to get comfortable. The crew were friendly and attentive. Only complaint was the time taken to retrieve bags in Denpasar. The Boeing 787 beats the other aircraft flying this route for comfort.",0
Singapore to Darwin. Jetstar flies out of Singapore at 11.30pm so an overnight flight into Darwin. Flight full managed to score exit row seats for myself and partner for $32 each. Able to use Singapore Qantas Club which was very nice and virtually empty. Having something to eat and drink earlier at hotel then QC Club no need to eat on plane used $10 voucher for bottle of water and wine. Uneventful flight on time only glitch was check-in at Singapore where one person was on though others turned up eventually but don't see why people have to wait because others are disorganised. Still prefer full-service I'm afraid.,1
"Jakarta to Medan with Lion Air. The service is just there, nothing special to mention. The flight attendants are servicing well, but the lack of enthusiasm and sincerity is showing. The seats are not comfortable, as they jam so many people in so the seats feel very cramped. There is also a rush to get overhead baggage as some people carry baggage that should not be taken to cabin at the first place due to their size. There is no inflight entertainment, and some seats don't even have in-flight magazines. The flight is not good, the landing is very rough though the weather is fine. I fly the earliest flight possible, so I don't experience delays that frequent Lion AIr services in Indonesia.",1
"Flew round-trip from Singapore to Siem Reap in August 2012. I checked in online a few hours before and saw that my ticket was for ""no baggage."" If I wanted to check a bag at the airport the cost would be $70. They limit carry-ons to 10 kg. My bag - perfectly acceptable by most airlines was 10.4 kg. I was informed had I bought my ticket on their website I could have paid just $20. The fare was not inexpensive either. So much for ""low-cost"" airline. Customer service is horrible.",1
"Manila to Iloilo return. Online booking and online check in was ok, ground crew friendly and proactive in offering the loyalty membership. The cabin crew were friendly and surprisingly both flights with minimal delays only.",0
"On JQ816 from Sydney to Brisbane. Tried to check in at the computers but could not do so because I was mistaking an I for 1. Went to one of their charming ground staff to enquire why I had no luck checking in. If looks could kill she looked at me and said ""can't you see I am dealing with someone else"" and then barked at me to see the service desk. I then got check in ticks and the computer decide to sit my two children away from me. Looking forward to the rest of the trip with JetStar.",1
"The last two times I have flown with Jetstar both have had technical issues & each time we were at the behest of an engineer to sign-off before being allowed to take off - a wait of about 90mins each time. Besides being concerned about the seeming regularity of this occurring on Jetstar - a free refreshment would have been particularly appreciated, but nothing - why? As a forced Jetstar passenger (ie Qantas dont cover those routes) I find this airlines service appalling.",1
"The service was excellent and On time, I would like to Appreciate the staff Varsha who Assist me with Check in and she was in boarding gate also. She was assisting everyone with a genuine Smile and resolving the query. Good to see this kind of staff, I will fly again with Indigo and recommend, just because the service which I received.",0
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Plane departed almost an hour late. Other than that, it was the usual AirAsia flight, with added comfort provided by the two seats next to mine being vacant.",0
"Service was good by the attendants. MEL-SIN legs IPads had enough content for an 8 hour flight. I prefer these as they come with noise cancelling headphones and better quality than seat back entertainment. Food was hit and miss but didn't go hungry. Seats are ok for day flight but struggled to get comfortable for the return night flight. I have to agree with other reviews in regards to space between seats. If you are seated against a window or middle seat, you will struggle for space once the people in front of you recline. Also on one leg there was gaffer tape used on one seat. Not a good look SIN-SGN return. Return flight was delayed but overall was a good experience. If you can get business on Jestar at a good price go for it, otherwise save your money.",0
Return flights Gold Coast - SIN - return. We booked this flight to add on to our onward European flights. We saved over A$1000 by SCOOTing from the GC to SIN then picking up Malaysian airlines from there to London instead of flying from BNE direct. A 7-8 hr flight is not hard work so we chose the Fly-Bag option and ate before we flew on both sectors. We paid to select extra legroom seats and travelled the equivalent of premium economy seat pitch and were very comfortable. Flights ran on time - and arrived ahead of schedule in both directions. Staff courteous and attentive. They cleaned the toilets at least 3 times an hour - more frequently than on any other plane Ive been on. I would not hesitate to recommend or fly them again. If you're aware its a low cost airline and go prepared with a meal in your belly your own iPad and a book and perhaps purchase a coffee on board and opt for the extra legroom - you can bag yourself a bargain.,0
My family and I caught a flight from SYD-MEL and I was very disappointed. The cabin crew were extremely unhelpful. There was no inflight entertainment whatsoever (not even the radios you could use on your arm rest like on other domestic airlines such as Virgin and Qantas). When we arrived in Melbourne Jetstar had lost my luggage. They contacted us in saying it should show up in 3 to 4 days and we were only in Melbourne for 4 days! It seemed like they didn't care at all! I would never travel with Jetstar again.,1
Flight AK1441 from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. Booking and flight document indicated departure of 21.00 Vietnam time and arrival 23.15pm Malaysia time with no delay in departure time. Arrived Kuala Lumpur at 01.15 (the next day) without any transit only to find out later that an added 2hrs flight is due to inconsistency in flight details generated by airline's system against actual flight duration. Ample of residual consequences including airport pickup charter and hotel booking arising with the timing mistake made by the airline's system.,1
"Delhi to Bangalore return with IndiGo. Used the airline twice in the month. Very punctual and crews very attentive, which makes the service very pleasing. Expanded food menu is a good development. The seats are a let down though , as it is not comfortable for a six-footer like me and that when journey is almost 2.5 hours.",0
"Scoot HNL-KIX r/t. Our tickets were only about $300/person, including 1 checked bag and 1 meal in each direction. For this price we did not expect much but we were positively surprised. The plane was clean and spacious, it even had mood lighting. The seats were not overly comfortable but ok even for a 9 hr flight. Leg room was sufficient. The crew was very friendly and approachable so no complaints about the service. There was a 1 hr delay on the HNL-KIX segment but we were kept informed at the gate; the return flight was on time. The only complaint are the high food and drink prices - about US $3 for a small bottle of water and the pre-ordered meal would have been cheaper if bought on board (the on-board menu listed a price of Sin $18 and I paid US $18 during booking). I would fly them again although the next time I would eat before the flight and bring more snacks on board (snacks are supposedly allowed and we had no problems nibbling on our chocolate and nuts that we brought with us). Overall, I would recommend this airline. For the price we paid it was great value.",0
"I am unhappy with the flights with AirAsia because in Penang I got my ticket for KL but the worker said that I could get the Phuket one from KL, she didn't even try to check things out and the weather was not well in KL so the plane went Penang to KL and Penang to KL. They said that they will help us out if we miss the plane. When we arrived to KL we had no ticket and the workers in the airport didn't explain clearly so we missed our flight and when we tried to book another flight, the worker said that it was too late to book a. 8.20 flight to Phuket when it was an hour before the fight. She gave us a flight the next day, I wasted my time and the money for a taxi and hotel.",1
Sydney to Denpasar. Booked via Qantas for points and only Jetstar business class was available. Very good product for a 6 hours long flight. Wide seats with generous recline (more of a premium economy level). Champagne on boarding. Very attentive service and delicious food. On time departure and arrival. Very happy with everything.,0
"Flew from Melbourne to Bangkok in what Jetstar deceptively market as ""business class"". There was one business class check-in counter, staffed by a trainee under instruction. The trainee looked like he had never seen a computer before and was receiving detailed instruction, key press by key press. Average processing time was about 15-20 mins per passenger, so even though only 4 people in the queue ahead of me, waiting time of over an hour to be served. Most of the people behind me gave up in exasperation and tried to find other ways to get on the plane before it took off without them Had plenty of time to observe the interaction of other staff between themselves and with customers. Their demeanor, professionalism and concern for customer satisfaction approximated what I would expect from prison inmates on day work release. The seats were in a 2-3-2 configuration and on any other airline that I have flown on would be described as premium economy. On my seat the recline and footrest buttons were jammed and inoperable. I would say Royal Jordanian Airlines is ahead and shoulders above the shambolic experience Jetstar deliver up.",1
MNL-BKK. Last minute change of plans so only booked a few days ahead. Price pretty much the same price as Philippine Airlines. This has been a steady trend with Cebu Pacific - they're not as cheap as they used to be. On the plus side the flight was bang on time not too crowded with efficient cabin crew. Drinks and snacks were available at reasonable prices. But the best part of using Cebu Pacific is operating out of Terminal 3 zero wait to check-in early morning and 10 minutes later I'm relaxing in Departures.,0
"Given our recent experience with Jetstar, this airline doesn't deserve a rating (can you give a negative score?), it was shocking. Our flight from Uluru was scheduled to depart at 12.55. Before leaving our hotel we received a text saying flight departure changed to 15.00. On arrival at the airport, advised departure now 17.30. (Given a $7 voucher for our inconvenience). Further announcement, departure now expected to be 18.30 (given another $7 voucher). By this time the only cafe at the airport had run out of all food. Later advised flight expected to depart 19.30. Plane arrived around 19.30, by the time we got airborne it was 20.15 approx. Got to my house in Melbourne around midnight instead of 4.30pm. No apologies offered by Flight Captain or Aircrew. (Our flight to Uluru from Melbourne was also delayed 3 hours).",1
"Indigo is comparatively better than any other airline I've ever travelled in India. Usually in Indian aircraft that travel to and from the Middle East, the flight attendants' service is quite bad. Here, though Indigo is a budget airline, the service is similar to that of a premium airline. The only thing they can improve is that, usually in Middle Eastern flights which travel to Kerala, they give announcements in Arabic, English and Malayalam but in Indigo and other Indian aircrafts, they give the announcement in English and Hindi. I feel that in an aircraft flying to Kerala, announcements in Hindi are useless since none of us Malayalee know proper Hindi. We can just understand it from here and there.",0
Flew IndiGo from Bangalore to Thiruvananthapuram. The flight was 2 hours late upon departure. Boarding was already 1:30 hours late and an additional half hour waiting time in the plane. My 3rd delay experience with IndiGo. Extremely unprofessional service.,1
Nov 2012 SYD-CLARK PH. Plane was new and clean and we left on time. Service was excellent and the food was well priced and good quality. Aisles are narrow and seats not made for anyone above average size. Plane arrived on time. No entertainment but was great value for the money.,0
"Sydney to Auckland. Bad timing, bad service. Delayed for 4 hours without informing me. It was meant to take off at 6.10pm but instead of it took off at about 10pm and will get Auckland at 3am the next morning. My mum has to pick me up in the early morning thats ridiculous.  Never want to travel with Jetstar again.",1
"Our return flight from Singapore to Melbourne was cancelled by Jetstar and we were forced to spend an additional night in Singapore. Whilst waiting in the Jetstar line at Changi airport, the single lady traveller in front of us showed us her cancellation letter from Jetstar which said she alone was entitled to be reimbursed SGD$150 for accommodation incurred. Each of the four passengers on our booking also received this letter emailed to our travel agent by Jetstar. Having put in our claim for reimbursement, we have been advised by Jetstar that as a booking of four passengers, we were only going to be reimbursed SGD$150 for all four of us for accommodation (it is impossible to get a reasonable room in Singapore for 4 people at this rate). Its the first time we have flown Jetstar overseas and it will be our last.",1
I was travelling with my kid aged 3 year and 11 months. I asked for nearby seats while check in. But the lady at the security check in desk denied telling its peak season and not possible.  Not at all adjustable.,1
Flew Hobart to Melbourne then to Phuket and back again in May 2015. Never again will we use them. From check in to the cramped seating to the appalling lack of service from rude cabin staff is just plain terrible. There was no meal offered on the Melbourne to Phuket leg or on the return leg. This is just not good enough. We also found the Dreamliner aircraft very noisy. Never again.,1
"Tiruchirappalli to Penang via Kuala Lumpur, and a long queue to check in luggage. The ground staff insisted on weighing the cabin luggage and laptop bag. The flight was delayed by half an hour, the plane was hot and stuffy. The legroom is very narrow, but the cabin crew are quite friendly.",1
Flew MLA-BKK return then domestic flight MLA-CYN return. No late running on these journeys though I know it can happen. The usual pleasant helpful staff except in Bangkok. They operate from Terminal 3 in Manila which is also decent.,0
"I travel 3 persons from Penang to Sydney using Scoot via Singapore. On my way back I increased my luggage allowance and at the same time choose all 3 seats. The sector for Sydney to Singapore was well done with the correct seat but not for Singapore to Penang. I choose seat 10 D/E/F but was given seat 26 E/F/G. When I feedback to their customer service.. here is their explanation after having spoken to them for over one hour on the phone - article 3.7 of our Condition of Carriage, we reserve the right to change your seat at any time, even after you have boarded the aircraft, for safety, security, operational or other reason at our sole discretion. As such, we regret that we are unable to accede with your request for a refund. I would adhere to the change of seat but even for this at least an explanation on the time of boarding will help ( but not done) and that Scoot should be courtesy enough to refund for not being able to provide the service. Though it is a small amount but this teach me a lesson of never take Scoot again.",1
"Firstly, I paid for full airfare for a Singapore flight ticket, which ended up as Scoot without a forewarning. Then, my original booking on 7th Jan 2023, got suddenly cancelled and was advised to take 6th Jan 2023, 02.00 hrs flight. I had paid for an additional leg-room seat on the earlier flight, which did not transfer to the new flight. We ended up in a non additional-legroom seat, though we had paid 330AUD extra for that. Also the flight staff were highly uncourteous. One has to go and fetch water, even if you request.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. Ground handling started seamlessly (as online check-in or by machine is pretty seamless). Boarding was according to expectation. During the flight the cabin crew were extremely friendly. However, the food which I had sausage and pasta was miserable and tasteless.",0
"Took a business class from Singapore to Athens return. We booked our flights pretty early, couple of months ago prior to the flight and booked our seats for the flight. Paid about SGD 2.2k per person. From Singapore to Athens, the quality of service and the standard of the service was way below par. The air stewardesses do not know what they were doing, some told us that we could have free flow water, some then told us that actually they do not serve water unless we purchase. Thereafter when it came to meal time, the stewardesses were clearly unsure of what was on the menu, i.e. we were offered the choices of pumpkin or turkey wrap, but actually, it was a pumpkin and turkey wrap. As it was an overnight flight, we were woken up 4 hours before the arrival for our meals, which was a little annoying for some of us whom have given them instructions that we didnt want our meals. From Athens to Singapore, during check in, we realised that our first row seats were given away to customers who did a 150euro upgrade. It was unprofessional of this airline as we booked our seats way in advance, paid much more for our business class seats, and the walk-in customers whom came by the counters, decided to pay for the upgrade with simply 150 euro, and yet they could take our seats which we have chosen beforehand. And we can all foresee, the counter staff, ground staff etc all said they cant do anything about it. We sent in a feedback to Scoot and as we can all expect it, there wasnt any response from them. We met another passenger who also told us that Scoot just cancelled his flight. Word of advice: If you really have to travel via business class seats, choose the first row as the rows 2 and 3 are not worth the heavy price tag. There wasn't any certainty and your seats can be given away to others.",1
Travelled from Gold Coast Australia to Singapore return. Easy and fast check-in with nice and professional staff at hand. Flight was good and both seats and food ordered was fine. Cannot expect 5 star restaurant food on a discount airline and generally most airline seats are not really that comfortable in any economy classes. Rented a tablet for flight but found it a bit boring so will probably rely on Ipad etc for future flights with Scoot. Will fly Scoot again should we have that option.,0
Took weekday flights from MEL-LST return. Both flights were on time for departure and arrival. All boarding and cabin staff were efficient friendly and cheerful. As you expect on a budget airline the seating is cramped but its no real problem on such a short flight. Overall no issues with the flight or service. The biggest problem is the shambolic departure area in the downstairs Qantas/Jetstar terminal in Melbourne. An absolute bunfight and a totally inadequate space to hold the number of people departing and arriving.,0
My wife and I flew Jetstar from Osaka to Denpasar via Singapore. Apart from a slight delay out of Osaka the remaining flights were smooth and most comfortable. We did reserve in advance the seats in front of the emergency exit for the Osaka/Singapore flight which provided more than enough leg-room. Standard seat selection was chosen for the Singapore/Denpasar flight. Will fly again with Jetstar definitely.,0
Overall a good experience from HYD-BLR-HYD and HYD-DEL. Planes are new and modern crew all young pleasant and helpful and speak perfect English. Seating is very tight - the person in from of me reclined their seat and it was in my face. They sell food which is tasty and well priced. One major negative as at check in at HYD. My company bought my ticket in the US and they asked me to produce the credit card. As I could not they denied me boarding until I bought another ticket which was very frustrating and almost caused me to miss the flight. They gave me an email print out for a refund but this is certainly not up to international standards.,0
Have flown with Jetstar Perth to Bali return 3 times in the last two years and Perth to Vietnam return once. All I can say is congrats to Jetstar the service on board and at the terminal is first class. With the number of flights out of Perth daily especially to Bali why o why is Jetstar not flying the Boeing 787 out of Perth. Qantas fly internationally out of Perth.,0
"Newcastle to Cairns via Brisbane. Can you believe that checked in baggage had to be claimed in Brisbane? Then, what to do with a suitcase for 5 hours? Ground crew told me that at their discretion I may be able to go through the screening team, and pointed to stairs. This however was not the case, so I lugged the case back down the stairs. If there is so much trouble with a domestic flight, it will be a dark day before I venture on an International flight, or another domestic flight. This did not happen on the outward flight but that was with another airline.",1
"While it is a very well managed airline, they can do better balance revenue management as a claimed low cost carrier and customer experience. Their staff is in constant search to find ways get a dime even if they are paid dollar extra in purchased services that are not used. Their interactions with passenger can best be classified as rude, their associates can learn compassion and empathy. Cant wait for Tata affiliated airlines to gain more traction. I try to avoid Indigo even if I had to pay 2-5% more.",1
The worst experience ever. They charge you a lot for 2 or 3kg extra luggage. You cant pay with USD or Euro only pesos. The staff is playing it stupid and did not mention the possibility to pay online. Indeed I do not recommend and the aircraft is pre-historic ATR 72-600 from the eighties For me its a big s.cam,1
Newcastle to Mackay via Brisbane. Jetstar made me miss Christmas. I was suppose to be with my family by 1015 am Xmas day. I got a text message only 1 hour (5am) before take of (6am) saying that the flight was delayed and won't leave until 1145am and that the next available connecting flight from Brisbane isn't available until until 7pm that night. Not only did they sent out a text only 1 hour before flight was dew to leave they offered no compensation. My supposed 4 hour travel turned 15 hour travel. Never will I fly with them again,1
"It was an early night flight from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was nearly full, and boarding commenced early and was efficiently conducted. The plane was able to leave the terminal building early but because of numerous aircraft waiting to take-off, departure was behind schedule. The flight was smooth almost all the way except a few minor turbulence in mid-air. Take-off and landing was good.",0
"I flew ScootBiz on two flights from Bangkok to Singapore and then from Singapore to Perth. The aircraft's were Boeing 777. The business class cabin was okay but the seats are not able to recline very much. The food was very basic but okay with just one drink being provided with the included fair. This airline needs to improve business class experience to make it worthwhile to ensure that there is priority boarding and exit from the aircraft using separate gate entry lanes and also priority luggage handling. There was no ""crowd"" control by flight staff on leaving the plane in Bangkok - with only 4 passengers in their business class on that flight the cabin was rapidly filled with passengers from economy competing to exit via the business class exit. There is no priority baggage handling for business class passengers. I had been unable to determine from their website how to access the inflight entertainment system with my tablet device so I had not downloaded the appropriate application before boarding the flight and could therefore not use it. I was impressed with the punctuality of the flights for both arrivals and departures being on time.",0
"Bali to Chennai via Singapore. On check in I was informed that I have to pay 320,000 rupees more. No explanation as per why, and when I insisted that I have paid everything needed to my travel agent when I booked the flight, I was simply told that if I don't pay this extra money I won't be allowed to go on the flight. So I did pay it, and asked for the IATA reclamation form. The person in charge didn't know what a reclamation form is, let alone have it. On the first flight I think I understood what has happened. A very impolite flight attendant served a meal saying that I have ordered a meal. I haven't actually, and if I had decided to buy it on the plane, 2 meals (for 2 flights) would have cost 100,000 and not 320,000 rupees. What must have happened is that my travel agent wrote on all the tickets I have reserved that I am vegetarian, and Scoot interpreted it as if I have ordered a meal.",1
"My experience has been very negative flying with them. I flew with them last weekend from Phuket to Jakarta and the flight was 6 hours delayed. Absolutely no compensation provided. Our flight was changed from 7.30pm to 1.30am so we eventually arrived at 3.30am. No apologies or explanation given by the airline either. On top of this we paid for a ""hot seat"" which was uncomfortable and didn't recline. Never flying with them again. The food choices were also really bad. Many things were missing from the menu as they ""ran out"".",1
"Christchurch to Auckland. The worst service, flight delayed with more than 3 hours. While awaiting I had to go and ask for regular updates. Staff was rude and laughed at me while getting upset. When laying a complaint they ask how they can help or make it better I said that they should put us on a later flight Sunday as they already took 3 hours of my time spend with family. They said they can't do that without additional cost. Don't ask me what can I do and then say no. Absolutely useless only gave a 1 because I can't give a 0.",1
"Manila to Siem Reap with Cebu Pacific. I have flown on this airline over a dozen times, and they are late every single time. The only thing they will give free is water. I asked for some hot water because I wasn't feeling well they would not give it to me if I didn't pay. Horrible airline, absolutely late every time.",1
"I have flown short-haul on JetStar a few times - nothing exceptionally bad or good to comment on, but you kinda get what you pay for. However, this review is for a flight I didn't take, and where Jetstar outperformed expectations. I had to cancel my holiday due to serious illness in the family and Jetstar gave me a full refund for my tickets. Their customer service staff were helpful, compassionate and efficient - unexpected from a budget carrier.",0
Gold Coast to Jaipur via Singapore. I am writing this review on the bad experience I had while travelling with my kids and old aged parents. We checked in from Gold Coast and got our boarding passes for our next flight to Jaipur in Gold Coast itself. Upon entering our flight to Jaipur only them we realised that our seats were the last row which does not recline at all. We checked 14 hrs before the flight yet we got the last row. The staff were were not helpful when we asked for help to change our seats saying the flight was full. To add to our misery our hand luggage had to be kept in between our legs as the overhead compartment was full. The hot meal pack food is pathetic. Other then that no much choice and very expensive. They don't even give water for free which is the basics. Absolutely pathetic experience - with the extras cost it comes as expensive as any other airline.,1
Another classic Lion Air flight for the two hour trip to Bali from Jakarta. The flight was smooth and seamless with cabin crew barely appearing down the aisle as they hanged out at the front behind the curtain. To be fair there was no service to be given besides the safety briefing and every one just got down to some sleep. Lion Air possibly has the tightest leg room seat in the industry with needing to buckle down their legs under the seat in front to fit them in. All in all a cheap flight which included 20kg baggage and a modern jet. Not bad.,0
Sydney to Launceston. The staff are so rude Ive had this happen multiple times where I will be ready to board and got spoken to terribly. I am actually disgusted in how horribly I have been treated and I definitely wont be flying with Jetstar again.,1
I will keep this short and simple: if trash could fly it would be this airline. It is not worth the money. Please dont waste your money on them. By far the worse airline Ive travelled with. And Ive travelled half the world.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Nha Trang. Simply the worst airline in the world, many years running. Ive been unfortunate enough to have to rely on this sorry excuse for an airline for years and not once, not once, have I ever had a good experience. Not a single flight that went smoothly, with no delay or some other nonsense. Awful service, always late, anything to take your money and always unpleasant. The only thing they havent charged us for yet is oxygen on board, which at some point it will probably be charged also, 10cents per breath. If only there were other options for certain destinations. Todays misfortune: retiming of flight the day before, only to come to the airport, go to the gate as indicated and find out there (i.e. at the gate) that there would be another delay on top of a change in gates. Still waiting to board, holiday ruined. Avoid this airline if you can. Pay more, get better service somewhere else.",1
"Their customer service is appalling staff are the rudest airline staff I've come across. I flew ""business class"" from Sydney to Singapore and I hated the experience. Check-in was chaotic with the supposedly dedicated business class line checking in a large group of economy class passengers. When I approached I was told to wait at the end of that line even though I was a business class passenger. No lounge access at Sydney airport. The main problem was onboard. Their business class seats were inferior to several major carrier's economy seats. Hardly enough legroom and the person behind was constantly bumping the back of my seat. Recline on the seats was minimal as to be unnoticeable. No inflight entertainment and all that was on offer was a miserable tablet pre-loaded with 3 movies which was not free not even for business class passengers. The food was horrible and simply consisted of a bottle of water and a container with brown heated goo in it. No way is it comparable to other low cost airlines operating in Australia.",1
Singapore to Perth. No major problems with the plane as it was new. Seats Ok but they have design problem with the button for service which is located on the arm rest. Seats are quite narrow and result is that me and other larger people were always accidentally hitting the button which annoyed the flight attendants and passengers no end. Catering was very disappointing. We pre-ordered wraps for lunch and these came with a drink. Wraps were as tasty as cardboard and drink was choice of coke or green jasmine tea in a can. We did not want either drink and asked if we could have water replacement. Completely surprising answer was that this was not possible with pre- ordered meals. We then thought we would buy something alcoholic - beer was warm so we decided on the wine. Decided on a white and then discovered that this was also warm. These are small things that could easily be handled with a bit more attention to detail and some flexibility by staff to keep passengers happy. Would I fly again probably because of the price but would not bother pre-ordering food and would check what I was getting before ordering anything on board.,0
"Bangkok to Melbourne. Was delayed 2 hours before they cancelled our flight at 11:50 for ""mechanical issues"" and was told our flight will be two days later! At first they said they would accommodate us in hotels but by the time we got to immigration any kind of assistance went out the window. It was an absolute chaos of confused people and of course trying to find accommodation for the next day was almost impossible because it was after midnight. The lack of care and any professionalism left many of us angry, frustrated and stressed. We'll have to wait and see if they'll reimbursed for any of our costs but one things for sure is that none of my family will be travelling with Jetstar again, and I'll warn anyone that is planning to fly with them that they most definitely should choose another airline.",1
BKK-BOM-BKK. Friendly crew. Check-in both in BKK and BOM easy. Food onboard was very expensive compared to Air Asia. I always carry snacks. Water free. Plane 2/3 full. Everything was so hassle-free that I have already booked two more flights on this route for May and October at the same price.,0
"Krabi to Bangkok with AirAsia. Cheap, but not serious. Flight hours were changed immediately after booking from attractive hours to less attractive. The day itself, 2 hours delay, no information. We arrived at our hotel around midnight instead of around the 1800 we initially planned. Cheap but not serious. Fool another idiot next time.",1
"Another good experience with Indigo, on time departure and arrival, clean fresh cabin, cheerful cabin staff, nothing much to complain with a LCC.",0
"Flight from Sydney to Phuket on a ""Dreamliner"". Typical Jetstar. An hour late leaving after already changing the schedule a few weeks before. Gave the usual lame excuses. I decided on this flight as it was direct. There were cheaper options but this was more convenient. The seats are definitely more comfortable than their older planes. They can't bring themselves to actually give you anything - not even a cup of tea on a 9 hour ride. It's a nickel and dimes show always. I paid quite a bit for their ""entertainment"" package but this was a rip off. Not much on offer. You would be better off loading up a few sticks and bringing your laptop or iPad. If I could have avoided them I would have but the choices are limited and they are not cheap tickets.",1
"Return flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The flight was slightly delayed, should have departed by 7 am as scheduled but departed at 7.34 am. There was mild turbulence during the early part of the flight but later the weather was fine all the way to Jakarta. All announcements (pre-departure, mid-air and before descend) were made by the captain. Landing was good.",0
"The worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Sent wrong information about the flight - no apology - Not informed of changes, no apology. Call centre staff are unhelpful - no apology. Spent over an hour calling them to request refund, from another country, and they gave no solution and will not even show the courtesy to call or even email customer back. They have no regard for customer.",1
Sunday 13th March I travelled from Hobart to Sydney. Staff were friendly and flight was smooth. However I was seated in row 30 and the leg room (pitch) was about 22cm from the edge of my seat to the magazine pocket. We had to put our carry-on luggage under he seat because there was no room in the overhead storage area. I stress that the flight attendants were excellent.,1
"Absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. We paid approx $1300 AUD for flexible fare tickets, tried countless times to contact them to change the dates with 10 days notice, were emailing back and forth everyday and the dates still weren't changed on the day we had to fly. There is no phone number or person you can talk to, each email is written by a different person asking the same questions and not doing anything to help you. Avoid this airline at all costs, we now have to look into how to legally get our money back but because they have no offices in Australia how is this possible?",1
Having gained my seat allocation and boarding pass online my partner and I made our way to Brisbane airport. The flight we had booked was JQ487 leaving at 19.55pm. Arrived in plenty of time and heard the first call to get seats. Made our way to the gate where a rather nasty young blonde woman stopped us to say our bags were too big for hand luggage. She insisted we stop and measure my partners bag. Once we boarded every overhead luggage compartment had luggage identical to mine and my partners all the same size and shape. I do not appreciate the rudeness of the crew who are paid for customer service. The only thing that saved the flight was the apology made by the steward who gave good service. Your flight staff are great but ground crew a lot to be desired!,1
"Hong Kong to Manila with Cebu Pacific. It's not only on flights that they fail royally but also on loyalty programs.  I flew on emergency to Manila via Hong Kong. So I didn't have the time to update my GetGo membership number in the booking I made the same day of my flight. I tried using the missing point claim option they have in their website but it rejected my request so I wrote to them. I received a reply that they will credit my missing points within 3 weeks. It's been more than a month now since getting that reply and still the points are missing. On each follow-up email I sent, they keep on sending me templatized apologies and no genuine action is being done. Is it rocket science to credit unclaimed points really? And oh, that membership doesn't come free unlike with other airlines, you have to pay a fee. And yet they rob you of your rights. Beware of this airline.",1
"The service has been consistently good. Easily the best airline for domestic travel within India. In my experience they have been on time every single time (6 - 7 times a year that I flew). Extra legroom seats are charged nominally, no business class. Decent choice of snacks and beverages (no alcohol), crew are very professional and friendly. The aircraft could do with some inflight entertainment though. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone visiting India or flying out.",0
"The Jetstar Airways so-called business class cabin is extremely cramped with seats more difficult to exit than most economy ones on other carriers. With other airlines providing an infinitely superior product at a lower cost, albeit with a one stop service, Jetstar is just not worth it. Pleasant and cheerful crew but they could do nothing about the inadequate seating and facilities in the cabin. My flight from Melbourne to Bangkok is not an experience I would want to repeat in a hurry. Unfortunately it's a return ticket with the same carrier. Overall: uncomfortable and poor value.",1
I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water.,1
"I have flown many flights with Air Asia and Air AsiaX over the past few years. I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations. But always compare ""all in"" is an advertising pitch leaving you to find it.",1
"My trip to Queensland was cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions and Jetstar refused to give me a refund. Shame on you, Jetstar.",1
"No customer service at all. We booked from Honolulu to Brisbane, although we were flexible with days there were no options to fly direct. The connecting flight was chosen for us by the booking system, you would think that the timing would be efficient but think again. Once you clear customs and collect your bags in Sydney you need to get to the domestic airport. The 2 choices of transfer shuttle are Virgin and Qantas, so we headed to the latter as Jetstar is Qantas and this particular flight was code shared Qantas / Jetstar. There is a sign at the transfer shuttle area informing Jetstar clients that they need to make their own way to the Domestic terminal and are not allowed to use the transfer shuttle. Once we arrived we went to the bag drop to be told you're too early you cannot drop your bags yet sorry? We are too early? But this is a connecting flight, how can we be too early when Jetstar ticketed the flight - care factor of Jetstar rep - zero. So after a 10+ hour flight we are left standing around the Jetstar counter for 1.5 hours before we can drop our bags so we can go through security and finally have a decent meal. Will never fly Jetstar again.",1
"Singapore to Sydney. Worst of the worst in budget airlines. Smallest seat, tightest legroom and noisy aircraft. I don't know how the Singapore government allowed these guys to fly. Biggest regret was thinking Singapore Airlines partner which turned out to be poor. Wouldnt recommend to anybody. Comfort was -100. Hardly room to move.",1
"Honeymoon trip: Flight to Rarotonga was sub-standard. No water (we had requested but they seem to have forgotten and we weren't that thirsty anyway to follow up), flight attendants only chatting amongst themselves and you feel rude interrupting them. The plane was too cold and had been told that they don't offer blankets. If you want really bad service, definitely fly with Jetstar. Cancelled return flight leaving us stranded at the airport. Our return flight back to Auckland from Rarotonga had been cancelled and Jetstar gave us the wrong information for our recovery flight leading us to miss it completely. They have taken no accountability for this lack of communication that shouldn't be an issue in the first place for any reputable airlines (or business) and have never apologised for their error. There was a group of 30-40 of us who missed our flights because we weren't given the correct info. Who is running this? This whole ordeal has been very frustrating and stressful and have received no sufficient help or support from Jetstar throughout this whole process. We will never fly with Jetstar again and will strongly advise our network or friends and family to do the same. The cheap prices are really not worth the stress that comes with travelling with Jetstar.",1
"Note that when you do online check-in, the system will assign you seats starting from the last row. I do not know about this and went to check in exactly 48h as per recommended thus was being assigned the worst seats ever. Non-reclined chair and near the toilet. The system is not smart enough to know that I'm travelling in group of 4 and to assign seats to us together thus I was assigned 3 seats in row 30 (right side of aircraft) and 1 seat in row 29 (left window seat of aircraft). I tried to change the seats by calling the call centre but they couldn't. The agent escalated my case and told me will return a call to me the next day for an update. However, she did not. So I decided to call back and found out that she had knocked off work for that day. I tried to communicate with other agents regarding my case but eventually it was still unresolved. Also, their manager was unhelpful and avoided clarifying my issues with me. He said that he would escalate the matter to HQ and will update by the end of his work shift. But he did not do so as well. This resulted in me calling the call centre serveral times as I could not reach the manager nor the first agent that handled my case. Eventually, when I spoke to 2 of his agents regarding my case, they hung up my call as they said that they couldn't assist me and had to attend to other customers. I was upset with how unprofessional they had attended to my seat flight case and the empty promises that the agents said they will return me a call but no one had ever returned a call to me until I persisted in my callings to reach one of them. However, I'm grateful that when I approached the check in counter staff during my departure, the front counter staff managed to change the seats as there were still available seats on the flight. Do be cautious when you make calls to the call center as they may sound polite but they may not be able to resolve your issue when problem arises.",1
"I travelled from Mumbai to Jammu and from Amritsar to Mumbai. My Jammu flight was by Air India and return flight was by Indigo. I had good experience with Air India, served a meal and it was complimentary. On the other hand, I was not served anything for 70 minutes by Indigo. When ultimately they served, the menu was extremely restricted and was on paid basis.",1
I used Air Asia to fly back to Australia from Vietnam where I now live. On the KL to Gold Coast leg I went to buy a meal using Vietnam Dong and was refused service as they don't accept this currency. They also would not accept a credit card! Hence I was looking at an 8 hour flight with no food or water. It took a lot of complaining for the staff to give me a single 250 ml bottle of water to last me the entire flight! I had to get to talk to the head steward as the others simply walked away from me and refused to offer anything whatsoever. The cabin crew completely ignored me after that and could not have cared less about my situation. I will never use this carrier again.,1
"I was not emailed or contacted regarding the cancellation of the flight. This outbreak has made many travel restrictions and bans to which I was not aware of. I had a feeling my flight was going to be cancelled long ago but it is difficult to contact AirAsia, they have a bot called 'AVA' which isn't a real person who would understand complex questions.  And if you think you can refund the amount you paid for a flight, you won't be pleased when you u read this.  They have refund in the form of ""points"" and ""membership"" benefits. I complained that I was not notified and said ""but you should already"".",1
"On our outbound flights Sydney - Phillipines, my partner and I travelled with one bag each (as we had booked). When checking in for our return flights we were told our booking only had 1 bag in total, despite our booking email showing two bags. The check-in agent insisted we pay 5000PHP excess baggage charge to take our return flights. On return to Australia, we have tried over ten times to resolve this issue with Cebu Pacific. Each time we were lied to, told a refund was coming but it never came. Cebu Pacific is intentionally changing people's booking so they can levy further charges. It's particularly terrible that they are doing this when travellers are overseas in the Phillipines and so are more vulnerable (no internet, not sure of local laws and customs).",1
"Flew Delhi to Mumbai and the first time I tried Indigo, via my travel broker. I have flown SpiceJet and Jet Airways and didn't really enjoy my experience with them, so I was keen to try another option. Pleasantly surprised on all fronts: customer service, flights were on-time and the inflight food was good. Seats were good sized as well, not as crammed as Spicejet. I would fly them again.",0
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. Everything went smoothly. Check in and boarding were painless, and the flight both departed and arrived a bit early. Seats comfortable, meals and drinks available at extra cost as usual.",0
"The seats were uncomfortable as there were 2 bars down the seat (my partner was the same), we were glad it was only a 7hour flight. Also, the flight was delayed 4 hours, which resulted in us missing our connection from Cairns to the Gold Coast. The food was mediocre at best, you had to pay for everything despite it being an international flight overnight - the blankets, earphones, entertainment, food, drinks (except water, drip coffee, and tea), everything cost money. Overall, I would only ever fly with them if I had no other option, or competitors were exceptionally more expensive.",1
"I booked on the airasia.com powered by kiwi.com website and found out today my flight has been moved 6.5hrs earlier to a time I simply cannot make (and makes the journey from Siem Reap to Singapore 13 hours long!). I am now being told I get no refund if I don't fly on it because it would be a 'voluntary' cancellation, and it will cost over $320 dollars more to rebook to a later flight on the same day. I thought maybe after covid the terrible travel services would cease, but I guess Air Asia does not care. Shocking treatment.",1
Mangalore to Mumbai. The Indigo staff at Mangalore was very cooperative. She helped to adjust all 3 family members for nearby seats. Cabin staff were alert and attentive. Good service.,0
"Auckland to Dunedin. I was charged excess baggage fee of $630. I was connecting from an international flight and aware of Jetstars stricter baggage allowance and called the Jetstar customer case and the representative told me that I would be charged $15 for excess of each 5 kg. I was prepared to pay at the counter but they told me that once the baggage drop is open the rate increases to $15 for excess of each 1 kg. I ended up paying $630 instead of $126. I explained that I checked in before the bag drop opened and nobody including the phone representative (that I called many days earlier) did not tell me that I should have purchase it before the bag drop opened. But they insisted that I should pay $630, not $126. I ended up paying $630 but called the customer care several times after that but they told me to provide the phone record so I prepared it. But they just notified that they would not provide refund no matter what.",1
Our flight from Townsville to Sydney was delayed twice due to engine problem on 14th feb causing us to miss our connecting flights to Hawaii. We are trying to make a claim through travel insurance. This process is very difficult to get information on the flight.,1
"Horrible experience. They say that my luggage is too big for cabin, because it doesnt fit a small box they had. But inside the airplane there was not only plenty of space but Ive flown with the same suitcase carry-on for years. So they had me pay a fee to take the luggage to checked baggage. I asked them if they can make it cheaper if I take stuff out. I had 15kg. They said no, 6500 yen is the cheapest. Then I looked on the website and the cheapest was under 14kg with 5500 yen. I came to the airport 3h before departure and waited and waited at the gate. I saw then boarding two other destinations (Singapore and Bangkok) before they started with Los Angeles (my destination). I went there one hour before departure because I was worried. They said that the gates are closed and we cant het checked in, I said I was there for 3h and not once did I hear them call the LAX flight.  They eventually let all of us in and we managed to get on the plane.  I just wanted the minimum amount of respect and professionalism when dealing with customers. If one of them complains, its maybe the customer whos crazy. But when you have 3 passengers not checked in because they didnt know where/when to do it, then there must be a problem with your system.  Thirdly, they didnt offer us water as a free service on a 10h flight. You had to buy it.",1
Delayed for almost 20 hours without food water and accommodation in Kansai airport. It was a midnight flight. No announcements to update status until 3 hours after departure time. Handled the exit and collection of luggage in a messy manner. Worst airline that io have ever taken. Unprofessional and doesn't care about passengers. Only having profit in mind. Didn't even care for passenger carrying sleeping child. They have to queue in a messy manner to collect departure card from AirAsia ground crew.,1
"Sometimes I seem to be repeating myself - travel from Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata 3-4 times yearly - but, once again, a flawless flight from IndiGo. Something I have written about in the past, the fact that the on board crew never has any Arrival Forms for foreigners, was finally rectified but, however, with an amusing twist: on my asking the cabin attendant for an Arrival Form, something that only non-Indian nationals need to fill, she very pertly asked me as to why I needed one since I look Indian. I replied that I was only 99.99% Indian, the remaining .01% being American as I carry that country's passport. (I did not mention that the Indian diaspora is the largest in the world. I was, however, tempted to do so.) P.S Food and beverages have to be purchased on IndiGo. I never comment on these as I usually carry aboard lots of munchies/snackies.",0
"Ticket cost $166.00, one extra bag cost $350.00. Travelers beware. I've been on eight flights using four airlines in the past eleven days throughout Australia and New Zealand and today I checked into my first Jetstar flight from Christchurch to Auckland. I went to the kiosk as I have numerous times this week prepared to spend up to $50.00 for my second of two bags. I was referred to the counter. Once weighed, I was informed that I was allowed 21 kilos, about 3 kilos less than the standard suitcase weight maximum. They explained that I had only purchased one bag and that I no longer had the option of adding a suitcase to my fare. They informed me that I was 23 kilos over and that would cost me $350.00. Quantas and Virgin happily charged for my additional bag and it was about $50.00. Astonished by their assertion, I asked if it would be possible to purchase it online. They promptly canceled my boarding pass and gave me an 800 number to call. I spoke to an agent and, once again, I was quoted policy. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they told me to speak to a supervisor at the airport and again, I was quoted policy. I thew out my shampoo and conditioner, shifted a few things into my purse and briefcase and checked in. I picked up a cup of tea before boarding as I have 100 times before and Jetstar made me throw it out before boarding. Thought it was odd as the other airlines always allowed it. Then they tried to sell me tea on board. It's small change, but how tacky. Great airline if you enjoy being duped. I'll never give Jetstar the opportunity to do it to me again.",1
"Tried to book a ticket, but kept getting error msg saying that the flight request was unsuccessful, please try again. After trying 4 times it finally worked. However I was charged for 4 tickets. Got confirmation mails for 4 flights but the 3 failed attempts without flight number or anything. Also its saying that i paid by cash while it was booked off my debit card. Frustrated I tried to contact the airline which is not properly working through their whatsapp service as well as on their homepage. Wrote emails but never got an answer. Finally someone replied via chat with a standard phrase please click this link for refund. The link was a link to google translate. After researching i found the refund page. But in order for me to request a refund i need the flight number which was not given to me for the 3 failed attempts. Therefore I can not request a refund. This is by far my worst experience.",1
"During the flight the food service was suspended right in front of me due to turbulence. Then they resumed it from the back of the cabin, but never came to me. When I called a flight attendant and asked for a meal, she told me that they have run out of it and added ""I'm very sorry"". Didn't offer even a glass of water. Throughout the whole 2 hr flight I was hungry and mad. I'll never fly AirAsia again.",1
"Recently I flew on Indigo on Economy class from Coimbatore International airport in India to India's capital city's New Delhi Indira Gandhi INTL airport.  This is my second flight after the pandemic lock down, things have changed a lot after the pandemic. The online check-in and selection of seats which is chargeable has been made mandatory, my flight was a bit behind the schedule departure time. As a low cost airline there is no In-flight Entertainment and food have to be pre-booked online and you also have the option to buy onboard with limited selection. All the passengers seated in the aisle and window seats were provided with a covid-19 safety kit that had a face shield, a face mask and some sanitizers, the passenger who were about to be seated in the middle seats were provided with PPE kits. As I had pre-booked the in-flight meal, I had to select from the list of available options and I had opted for a prepacked bottle of fruit juice and a bowl of prepacked readily made south Indian food. The food was above average even though it was a prepacked one.",0
MEL-BKK in economy. Booked Jetstar on this route a number of months ago as it was advertised on their website as B787 Dreamliner service. Received an email from Jetstar two weeks before the flight informing about 'schedule change' which should've read 'equipment change' as they substituted A330 Nightmareliner service instead. Typical Jetstar lack of truth in advertising and false information provided at booking. With two weeks notice this was not maintenance related but rather it was planned. No refund offered despite the B787 being the only reason I booked. The flight itself was typical Jetstar. $46 for my checked bag $20 for an 'up front' seat $59 for the 'plus' package etc. Nickeled and dimed to death. Old plane poor condition little legroom completely inadequate IFE with mind numbing looping of inane videos on circa 1990s monitors throughout cabin. On balance overpriced for what it is which is the core Jetstar problem. On the positive side the all Thai crew was warm friendly efficient and professional.,1
"I booked a flight last june. they cancelled (covid). Submitted a request for a full refund, waited 8 months only for them to cancel my case! No email, no communication on why they refused my refund! I cant get my money back. cant even get credit with them as compensation. They have made it impossible to contact a real person, only the stupid AVA chat bot. I paid for a service, never got the service, never got my money back.",1
Chennai to Singapore. I faced a nightmare with the booking I made with this airline for later in January 2019. One of the worst booking system this airline is using. I faced 3 times payment declined with international credit cards. One time payment deducted and took several days to get the refund. Again I had nightmare when I tried to purchase seat selection via visa CC issued by overseas bank.  I never had such a bad experience in 20 years of travelling.,1
Delhi-Bangkok-Delhi. New A320 aircraft's were clean. Since it is a budget airline they are very particular about checked in baggage and charge for every extra kilo. Even some passengers were nasty the flight attendants were friendly. I took my meal from airport so it was better and cheaper than on board. The flights were on time. I would fly IndiGo again!,0
"Okay so Im currently at the airport right now and Im already being treated poorly. When I first arrived to the gate, no one was at the ticket counter so I thought itd be fine to sit inside. However a few minutes later the attendants returned and told me I had to wait outside to check my boarding pass, so I did. Then they started letting people sit at the gate after checking their boarding pass so I went and sat inside the gate while waiting for my flight. However, an hour before my schedule flight, the attendants came by again to kick out all the passengers from the gate because of security reasons so everyone had to wait outside the gate while the attendants boarded the plane. When the attendant came to kick me out, she told me politely to leave so I was packing my things but she clicked her tongue at me as I left. The price is cheap, but I found Hawaiian Airlines to be cheaper than ZipAir and never have been treated like this at any airline before, hence the poor review. Staff definitely needs more training since they assumed I couldnt speak Japanese and kept muttering things under their breath like tsk we cant avoid (scary looking) passengers like that or (its annoying that) we have to keep repeating the same things etc. These are just a few things I heard and I dont think Ill ever fly with Zipair again.",1
Chennai - Mumbai and back. On time departure clean aircraft efficient cabin crew and on-time arrival. No wonder that they are the most preferred airline for domestic travel within India.,0
"The worst flight ever. No meals even a glass of water. You have to order and pay. That is the only reason why they provide free wifi which it give a limited access. You have to use your own cell phone or pad to watch few movies which again, are dating for few years (around 10 movies from 2012 and 2020, no new movie. The passenger crew past all the time to assure your security and check your seat belt! Really not appreciated my 2 flights.",1
"Terrible Airline! Flew Queenstown to Bali via Sydney. Will never fly with them again! Of course its a budget airline and I understand that but seriously its a joke. We purchased luggage for 35kg then when we arrived and tried to check in they tell us 32kg is the max! Nowhere does it say it can be in up to 10 bags! They weigh your carry-ons to the T. 7kg and no more. So here we are at the check in counter being pregnant, trying to put on layers and layers of clothes which we are just going to take off after security and put right back in the bag so whats the difference. I've never had an airline weigh and criticize our carry on luggage. We still ended up having to pay another 100 dollars for another checked bag at the counter. First she said it would be 75 dollars, then when we are abour to pay tells us oh it's 100 dollars because you have another stop. So we ended up paying an extra 250$ for nothing. We could have just booked Qantas for cheaper, have our bags included, no hassle with carry on weight, a meal included and complimentary alcoholic beverages included. Worst experience with Jetstar. Would not recommend.",1
"In a recent business trip to Singapore, my usual airline was booked full. I decided to try Lion Air. I am disabled and require a wheelchair for long walks. That is always a challenge for any airline to get right. My usual airline, AirAsia, does not charge for a wheelchair if arranged up front. Lion charges a whopping 30.00 SGD for a wheelchair. Now my first piece of advice, do not use Lion Air is you need help getting around. I found that the words ""Customer"" and ""Service"" are fairly unknown. Lion is especially bad with that concept. If there was a zero star rating I would readily give them that rating. I am an American, Indonesia extends what is called a ""Visa on Arrival"" to USA and some other countries. When I went to get my boarding pass the Lion Air employee refused to give me a boarding pass because I did not have an Indonesian Visa in my passport. I tried explaining that I get the visa on arrival. He still refused. I asked for his manager and explained it to her. Finally after much deliberation (and showing where I have done this many times before) they issued my boarding pass. The young man apologized that he was only doing his job. Well I am sorry too but warning people of poor service in this forum is mine. In all fairness most of the people were nice but still did not take care of the customer. One young man at Jakarta was helpful but only after paying him an additional 100,000 IDR.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney booked for October 2020. Just called customer service and explained that my accommodation in Sydney had closed its doors & issued a refund due to covid, my travel insurance company issued a refund also. Jetstar won't even give me a voucher to fly another time. Melbourne is in stage 4 lockdown & you can't fly anywhere anyway, my trip is for 5 nights but you have to quarantine for 14 days if your not from that state. I asked why they haven't changed the terms & conditions in accordance with with the global pandemic, she just kept saying no our policy doesn't change.",1
"Take note that Scoot seats are not random assigned if you checked in online. The system assigned seats starting from the last row. I called Scoot on 17 Dec to speak with an agent  with regards to the seat assignment as I did not know seats are assigned in this structure. She said its true that seats are assigned from starting from the last row but she is unable to assist to change my seats unless I pay. Another agent also claims that ""its a secret that the system assigned starting from the last row"". I told the agent its unfair to not make this known to customers especially when its a common understanding that last row seats are one of the worst seats to sit. My conversations with Scoot lasted even till 29 Dec and little resolution was given. Scoot kept delaying my issue and I believe this is one of their tactic to shun the customer away.  Those who are reading my review, I would just like to alert you to be cautious of your conversations with Scoot staff as many of them are not reliable. When customers have issues, Scoot most likely will not able to resolve your issue.",1
"The system auto assigned my 8 yr old daughter to a seat 12 rows from me, which is against the airline's safety policy. When I contacted Customer service to raise my concern, they agreed to move her to a seat close by. But then at airport check in, I couldn't print boarding pass. Was told to go to payment counter and pay for changing my daughter's seat! After escalation, the manager even accused me of putting my daughter in a far away seat but now wants to move her closer, hence I should pay. I find her accusation so ridiculous. She finally agreed to waive seat charge, as though she did me a favor. I wonder why AirAsia system would assign young kids to sit by themselves.  My advise. Go with another airline!",1
"We have had a terrible experience with Air Asia. Three weeks before our flights, we received notification that they had cancelled both of our flights for operational reasons. We were automatically rebooked on flights - one of which was an entire day later than our initial itinerary. We couldn't miss the day of work, so attempted to get a refund or credit for that fllight. Absolutely no ability to contact a human, and everything was done through the chat bot - except that the bot was obviously incapable of understanding the situation. We explicitly said we needed a refund for one flight. In the meantime, we booked quickly with another airline (at substantial out of pocket cost). Instead? No refund, but they credited both flights which meant that we now no longer had any route to our destination! We also can't rebook the original AirAsia flight because the price has quadrupled. Absolutely no customer service or assistance. We are left with three lots of flights we can't use, a substantial amount of out of pocket cost, and no apology.",1
"Mumbai to Kolkata with IndiGo. Our flight was first delayed by 30 minutes then once we got to get our boarding passes they tell us our flight has been split in 2 so now we have to fly to Hyderabad then to Kolkata. Alongside that once we boarded the plane they said theres even more time to wait to clean up the deck, what in the world does that even mean, please tell me.",1
"Christchurch to Gold Coast. This is not a good airline with inconsiderate staff in Christchurch, NZ specifically. Being from the US, I wasn't aware of the fact that even flights between NZ and AU are considered domestic. So, in order to mooch off of the passengers they have this annoying rule of 7kg carry on only. Its unbelievable that the airport treats you like an international passenger but the airlines treat you like a domestic traveler. Their scales obviously are manipulated and they charged me $75 for being over 7kg. I went in winter time so, obviously I had heavier clothing. In their flights, they don't serve anything coz again to save their money, it's a domestic flight. Such unfair practices just to charge international passengers unnecessarily. If customer service is something they cared about they wouldn't be treating us like this.",1
"Bhubaneswar to Mumbai via Hyderabad. As usual, full marks for their service in the aircraft. From check-in to the boarding (although flight was delayed due to bad weather in Bhubaneswar), they also gave constant updates about the status of the plane's arrival also. Otherwise, no complaints at all about their service .",0
"This Bandung - Kuala Lumpur flight was a morning flight. It arrived in Husein Sastranegara Airport on time but departed 10 mins late. The plane encountered mild turbulence on the early and later part of the flight, but generally it was smooth. Landing was okay in KUL. Arrival was on time. This time I ordered the satay wrap, and it was succulent.",0
"I was surprised by the leg room on budget airline Scoot. It is almost as good as the full service airlines. The plane is new and the seat comfortable. Apart from the lack of a TV screen on the seat back and food service, it almost feel like a full service airline. I did pre-order a beef casserole and it was delicious.",0
"Queenstown to Auckland. Our experience with Jetstar Airways on a flight in New Zealand was very disappointing due to the disruption in the flight, the subsequent lack of communication, and the promises of staff that were not supported by corporate. Jetstar experienced a countrywide failure in their computer systems causing manual processing leading to delayed flights. Our flight was delayed over 4 hours causing our connection to the US to be missed. There was no later flight, so an overnight stay was required. There was no communication about status - the flight boards were not updated. In fact the board showed that we had arrived, when in fact we hadn't even left. I was not able to pursue changes with the connecting flight airlines because they showed the flight on time.  Upon arrival in Auckland I was informed we would be transported to a hotel and provide meals. Later I was told the transportation would not be provided but we could take the Skybus and submit expenses for reimbursement. I asked if there was more than one hotel for the brand and was told no. When I got to the Skybus counter, I was asked which of the two hotels for that brand. I went back to the ticket counter to get the specific location, and by the time I returned we had missed the bus. Upon arrival in Auckland there was a long (1km) walk to the hotel. Upon checking out the next day we were advised that the hotel was paid, and a $30 credit for meals was applied. The latter in direct conflict with written policy that it should've been $60 and further that the airport representative stated that would not be limited to $60. Upon return to the airport the next day, there was no one available to handle the reimbursement request so we submitted the request for expense reimbursement online ($167). After waiting over a week past the processing timeline I followed up via chat. At which time I was advised that they would not support reimbursement of any kind despite the statement of staff. No avenue for escalation was provided. I accessed their chat complaint system, uploading all of the original documents supporting the reimbursement request. I was on the chat for 2 and  hrs. and asked redundant questions and then to be advised there is no reimbursement. At one point the individual stated there is no reimbursement when in home city, which was blatantly wrong as it was clear my home city is in the US. Thankfully, Jetstar did arrange and pay for the hotel as they obviously acknowledged the need. But the rest of the response was not worthy of your trust and patronage.",1
I booked with Qantas frequent flyer points on the Qantas site and received all Qantas conditions etc. I went to the Qantas counter in Brisbane and was told I was to go down to Jetstar because it was a JQ number I was flying Jetstar? I had just driven to Brisbane as Qantas do not go to the Sunshine Coast. When I arrived at Jetstar there was just one girl attending to the baggage drop. I was eventually given my boarding pass and allocated seat 17. The Jetstar representative checking the cabin luggage was very officious. I lined up and the representative said to weigh my handbag computer and fascinator for the Cup the fascinator weighed nothing the total weight was well under 10kgs. The fascinator was damaged during this process. I asked if I could just carry the fascinator on board then she said you can only have 2 bags. I said the hat weighs nothing though. She said well put the hat on your head! I then boarded the plane and by the time the food arrived the air hostess said there was nothing left and I had to go without a decent lunch. Prior to boarding the plane there were four people near me who swore they would not fly with Jetstar again. I was very disappointed overall and definitely believe you have issues that need to be addressed.,1
Bangkok to Singapore. We booked a flight to Singapore at 7pm for the same day at 11pm. We went for check in at 8pm to be told the flight was cancelled. The staff mentioned that it got cancelled the day before! Why did the website allow us to spend our money for nothing? They mentioned that it was not cancelled but delayed to the next day at 1pm. We tried to call the call centre multiple times with no answer.,1
"Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. I love the flights themselves. Very well priced, punctual and the in flight crew are great. I have given a 1/10 rating for AirAsia's lines of communication pre and post-flight. Facebook and twitter are ghost towns. There is no longer anyone you can get on the phone. You can't find links to make email enquiries. Their virtual assistant AVA isn't much smarter than a house brick. If AVA can't help you she directs you to the 'ghost towns'. If nothing goes wrong you will experience a well priced, punctual and reasonably comfortable flight but if you need to contact anyone to sort out any kind of problem then just forget it.",0
Have flown Cebu Pacific many times now. They are cheap unless you have extra bags or extra weight or make last minute changes or miss a plane out of Manila. (get to MNL airport early!). Sometimes the flight leaves before the posted time. Their website is frequently not working correctly. Tried to pay for extra bags and kept getting an error message until after it was past the deadline for adding bags. Then had to pay at the airport extra. You can expect a last minute gate change frequently and you can expect to walk or bus to Term 2 in Manila from the plane even though the plane is sitting right at the enclosed walkway. Carry-on policy is sporadic so going from an International flight to a domestic flight on Cebu Pacific can be tricky and costly. With Cebu Pacific you get what you pay for - cheap flights and not always the greatest in customer service. Most Cebu employees really try hard though.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Mal return. My very first flight AK 72 was considerably okay but the return was terrible. Both female flight attendants were rude, discourteous when they served the food. One of them nudged me hard to fasten my seatbelt in the middle of the flight due to turbulence. No please or excuse me, just a rough nudge. The male attendants were nice and were trying to do a good job.",1
Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore using Scoot Thru Purchased upgrade at check in for $179 to business class was told luggage was checked right through to final destination being Bangkok. Arrive Changi Connect transfer desk to receive boarding pass to Bangkok told that Gold Coast would not have checked luggage in and if I wanted to travel I would have to pay $55 as luggage was in a transfer container. Explained whole story they admitted their mistake but didn't care $55 or no travel. Seats in business Very hard and recline at odd angle making sleep impossible economy much much worse stick to Air Asia much better product!,1
I frequently fly Air Asia and like the cleanliness and modern aircraft. This flight was Perth to Kuala Lumpur. The seat business class seating is okay and almost lie flat enabling a couple of hours sleep on the flight. The airline policy for quiet areas at the front on the plane is very good.,0
Shanghai to Manila. The check-in was effective and quick. The aircraft in good and clean condition. The seat distance at an emergency exit is very large. The on-board catering and drink against payment were average. Overall a good price performance ratio.,0
"All seats and meals were pre-ordered on 16/10/23. SIN-MAA seat 12A exit row,  correct meal served. MAA-GOI seat 19A exit row, GOX-MAA seat 19A exit row, MAA-SIN booked exit row 12D. Equipment/ aircraft change, due to bigger pax load, the exit rows are now rows 18/19. IndiGo ground service changed aircraft but did not change my 12D exit row to 18D exit row. I found out onboard. Cabin crew only allowed me my exit row seat when I showed them my proof and told them I would like to voluntary offload before the cabin door shut if I don't get the seat I paid for. Next, The cabin crew also served me a Paneer mutter sandwich instead of my pre-order of Paneer Bhatti. They insisted that it was the meal I ordered until I showed them on paper my proof as this was a corporate booking. The meal was returned as my pre-ordered meal was not loaded on the flight. I declined their offer of alternatives.",1
Flight was delayed by 45 minutes. Usually this flights was delay. After landing luggage reach on belt after 50 minutes. No intimation & no announcement.,1
Went on a family trip from Singapore to Gold Coast in June 2013. Chose the yellow seats with extra leg space and they are quite comfortable. The seats at the back looks too cramp for me but it is much cheaper for those who don't mind the space. We didn't rent any entertainment on board as we came prepared. The service on ground and in the air are excellent. Thank you Scoot for the pleasant experience.,0
"We flew from Bangkok to Bali and back with AirAsia. The Bangkok segment was a disaster. I booked online and paid for reserved seats (both ways for 2 people) and meals. When we went to the airport the flight representative said that we had to pay for seats to sit together. I explained that I had already done that but she said that I was not in the system. So I had to pay for seats again (and then were still not together). The flight itself was equally poor. Absolutely no legroom and there was no audio or video program for the 4 hour flight. The meal was laughable, we could not work out what was in the bread. The Bali return was much better as the representative was attentive and helpful. He found that we did in fact pay for seats online and offered to put us in the exit row with extra legroom for a minimum cost which we gladly accepted. We were aware enough now to bring our own food, this time so to avoid being served what they call ""food"".",1
"Lombok to Perth. We paid over $100 to add our luggage to the plane, and when we landed, we realised they had not loaded 90% of the passengers luggage on the plane. I had many items in my luggage that I require for work, and now I have to wait and hope it arrives. I was not assigned in the seating I had chosen. I  chose an isle seat as Im a nervous flyer and they put me, in between 2 other passengers. They dont take card on the plane? So if you want a meal or a drink and dont have any cash, too bad.",1
Flew ScootBiz BKK to SYD with change of plane in SIN as an experiment to see what this airline is like even though I had other options. For budget airlines the seats were actually quite good food not so bad but the flight attendants were extremely good. Nuisance to have retrieve luggage in SIN and check-in again but SIN excellent airport so not a problem. Had it been BKK or most other airports I would not agree to fly with an airline where one has to retrieve luggage and check in again on the same airline.,0
"Perth to Singapore. My wife and I were most impressed with Scoot. From checking in at the airport, the staff were obliging and friendly. The seats were comfortable, plenty of legroom, food was excellent and cabin staff very polite and friendly. On the return journey, the only complaint we have is that we were seated opposite the toilet and this at times had its moments of drifting odours. We are flying again at xmas time and hope we again have a good experience.",0
"I was flying to Amritsar and flight attendant Somiwon and her buddies did a great job taking care of me and other passengers. The demeanour was positive and helpful and customer service excellent! I never receive such great service on domestic flights to India. In my return flight I had the same service, especially my cabin crew leader Aarti. I am impressed and proud of the young ladies in Indigos cabin crew. Indigo airlines is fortunate to have a motivated and talented cabin crew!",0
Flew MEL - Darwin on JQ61 which then continues on to Singapore. Signs were bad to start with when the check in area at Tullamarine was shambolic with enormous queues and no bag drop operating. Eventually made it to the downstairs departure lounge and queued at the allocated gate only to find at the last minute that the gate had changed with no announcement which left about 50 passengers scrambling through the terminal to catch the flight. With the doors shut plane then sat at the departure gate for 25 minutes with no advice or announcements about the reason for the delay and how it would effect our arrival time. When the flight finally departed about a third of the in flight snack menu was unavailable and the attendants were unable to accept foreign currency despite us receiving an unsolicited email from Jetstar 2 days earlier explaining that foreign currencies were accepted on this flight. With a budget airline like Jetstar the customer needs to have budget expectations but its no excuse for the airline not misinform passengers and stuff them around. Jetstar is definitely slipping.,1
HKG-MNL-HKG - first leg was during the busy Christmas period (flight was Dec 24). Excellent check-in experience in HKG. HKG has a well earned reputation as one of the best airports in the world. I love the fact that you can do web check-in with Cebu. It helps when you get to the airport and puts them above some other low cost airlines. Busy flight to MNL but flight on time and in-flight staff are excellent as I've experienced in the past with Cebu. Quick baggage delivery in MNL and terminal 3 is by far the best in MNL. Love the all over free wifi as in HKG. However the experience there during the return to HKG was not quite the same. Cebu staff managed to give us the wrong boarding card which we discovered after going through security (and the associated payment of airport fees). It got fixed but it was the first time I've ever experienced this sort of thing. Made for a stressful departure out of MNL. Better look closely at your boarding pass when flying Cebu. Inflight to HKG was exactly the same as before. Again a very busy flight but friendly in-flight staff and plenty of smiles. While you definitely get what you pay for and Cebu is a low cost option I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.,0
Sydney to Gold Coast. Staff less than polite Lady weighs bags at plane entry and we are 3 kgs over so we are directed to pay $60. The guy who took the money from us lacked customer service skills - was less that responsive when we approached him to pay money and was quite rude. Unlikely to fly Jetstar again,1
"Ahmedabad to Nagpur. No time management skills. they changed the gate number at the end moment no announcements were made. We were asked to stay in line for almost 1 to 1.5 hours. The flight was not on time. Will not travel on this flight again, worst experience ever.",1
HKT-CNX. Comfortable flight only marred by a group of unruly passengers. Thai crew unable to control them but then who could? Flight on time and thankfully shorter than advertised. New and clean plane with leather seating. All in all a decent experience will fly them again.,0
"Christchurch to Sydney flight delayed by 30-35 minutes with no explanation. Ground staff at gate clueless. Turns out the airport has dual boarding / deplaning lanes and shared gate areas so had to clear one flight before allowing ours to board. Had the emergency exit row, which made for a better experience than our previous flight, from MEL to CHC. Cabin crew very pleasant and planes are clean. Still, has a cattle class feel. Why does Jetstar and Qantas have flights on the same route departing within 10 minutes of each other?",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Krabi. We booked our flights online, and our reservation was changed by Airasia without notice. They changed the time of the flights, changed the bagages allowances, etc. That caused a big problem at Male airport in Maldives where the staff was especially not collaborating and unfriendly. We have big the victimes of their unfair online system as still had to pay the price for this. Booking on Airasia is like playing russian roulette. I started my trip at Krabi airport where my 22 kg bag was accepted as a 20 kg check in bag. Then the same bag wasn't accepted in Kuala Lumpur and I have to waste 10 minutes and make the queue even worst to take out things from my bag. On the way back from the trip, same problem at the Cebu airport. You can take 25 kg ++ carry on bags without paying a check in bag while people like me who try to respect the check in system are just treated rudely for 2 kg in excess.",1
"This was a disaster. We were stranded in Coron for 24 hours due to mechanical issues. The real problem was that the staff made no effort to help the passengers or give us any information. At first they tried to assure us that the plane was just delayed a bit, but when the later flights started leaving and we were still stuck, everyone started to line up for answers. The staff hid. One guy was ill and needed to get to a hospital, while many others had onward flights in Manila, and still the staff hung around, doing nothing. By the following day, most people gave up and got flights on Philippines Airlines. We are still fighting to get reimbursed for the flight that never happened, but I'm not counting on that happening any time soon. Best to avoid Cebu Pacific if you have any other options at all.",1
"Bangkok to Singapore. Scoot doesn't accept transit passengers and in order to connect in Bangkok, you have to go through immigration, check in, and go through immigration again. Both flights are international for Bangkok, so, this is only natural to do all this in transit hall of the airport. We had to make the visa to go out (USD 60 each). So, the budget airline became super expensive suddenly.",1
SGN-KUL-LGK-KUL-SGN. Online check in is convenient but document check in LCCT KUL (KUL-SGN) is very inconvenient for pax because of lack of information on screen (line for KUL-SGN flight) change counter and waiting at gate (Y1 Y2) so long. The arrangement in terminal is not good pax standing in font of Y1 Y2 gate will be bother by others going to oversize luggage inside. In flight LGK-KUL there was a medium turbulence on take-off phase airplane was down but no announcement was delivered.,0
SYD-MNL. Check in process looked like it was going to take a long time (huge line) but actually was very well run and took less than 20 minutes. Departed on time/arrived on time. I am 6ft3 and a very large build yet found the seat width and legroom (in the last 4 rows) very good and actually better than a lot of full service carriers. We did not pre-order any meals as they looked less than appealing but snacks were available and very reasonable prices. Great cabin crew always around if needed. Toilets kept clean and despite a full flight were never overcrowded. Very happy with this flight.,0
OOL-SIN. Had opportunity to upgrade to scootbiz was worth every cent even with the extra cost was still cheaper then full service carrier - would recommend.,0
"This is the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my life. They should be banned from running their business. I had a flight scheduled for 630PM to CGK booked for Lion Air on august 17th. The night before the flight they sent me telling me the flight had been cancelled with no information on the new departure. I started to worry, I ended up going to sleep and at around 10am the sent me the schedule for the new flight. It was leaving at 7:15pm but from another airline Super Air Jet. So we arrived at the airport on-time and waited for boarding at 6:45pm - we didnt board until 7:20pm and didnt take off til 7:45pm. By the time we landed in CGK our connecting international flight had already boarded and was leaving. We were left stuck til 2:40pm the next day.",1
"I fly frequently with Jetstar for both business and holidays. They are almost never on time and I have been put out on many occasions by their delays - one should always expect Jetstar to be running two hours late and then one is less likely to be disappointed. I had plans to fly to Sydney this weekend for a visit to the Blue Mountains. My accommodation and other plans were cancelled as the area is consumed by bushfires. The NSW government has declared a state of emergency and evacuated the entire area I planned to visit. Jetstar will not allow a refund nor credit for future flights, so I have essentially thrown away the cost of two roundtrip tickets I can no longer use. As a frequent Jetstar customer I am extremely disappointed and will not be flying with them again. Virgin and Qantas cost the same when you consider all of Jetstar's extra costs, like $60 for baggage over 7kg. And Virgin and Qantas make for a much better experience.",1
"Overall excellent service from Scoot, however disappointment arose due to the late arrival of the aircraft outbound from Singapore, causing a knock on effect for the inbound/return flight from Sydney. However the crew managed the delay very efficiently and well. Cabin attendants were friendly, highly attentive and warm, with a Singapore Airlines-esque manner/aporoach in their service, procedure and announcements. Seats were uncomfortable with the lowest version of economy class, lacking headrests. Inflight meals were tasty, healthy and fresh but not so filling for an 8 hour flight. Inflight entertainment choices were very limited and not worth its price value.",0
"Perth to Denpasar Bali on Low Fare. Had to cancel trip, and Air Asia after 2 months of negotiating gave us a partial credit which had to be used within 3 months. We were Loyal BIG Members. After this lack of compassion we will be looking at other carriers to Asia from Perth.",1
We flew return from Melbourne to Tokyo on Jetstar. The flights were non stop so only 10 hours. Each flight left and arrived on time. The staff were efficient and friendly. We pre ordered vegetarian meals and they were excellent in fact some of the best airline food we have had. There is no inflight entertainment as advertised so we took our own iPads loaded with books and movies. We only had carry on luggage and although it complied with weight restrictions no one checked the size and weight. The seat pockets needed a good clean out as I found on both trips but the cabin and bathrooms were kept clean throughout the trip. The distance to the seat in front was a little squishy when the couple in front threw their seats back for the the return trip. This would be a problem if you are large. But I've had the problem on higher priced full serviced flights so it comes down to the courtesy of your fellow travellers. To date we have taken about 10 Jetstar flights and never a problem. You get what you pay for which initially is just a seat. All in all I will continue to fly Jetstar when the cost and flight duration remain so competitive.,0
Flew ScootBiz: Singapore-Tokyo-Singapore via Taipei. The seats we booked miraculously disappeared on check-in and we had to sit separately on the return journey. The free inflight entertainment in ScootBiz was non-existent and cabin crew said the cabin wifi system wasn't working properly. We won't fly Scoot again and we wouldn't dream of recommending it to anyone.,1
"Sydney to Phuket. Don't gamble with their ""Starter Fare"" I needed to cancel a 'Starter Fare' Jetstar ticket to Thailand - all options (name change, date change, destination change) were prohibitively expensive. The options were more expensive than buying a new ticket. Their call centre and chat centre are in the Phillipines and are bound to a rigid script. Even their 'Compassionate Grounds' chat line was a heartless dead end. They took all my money for no service.",1
Delhi to Port Blair via Kolkata. IndiGo used to be my best option because of its on time schedule. But due to a few problems and  delays I chose other options like Vistara. On 12th November 2016 I again chose IndiGo for a family holiday in Port Blair from Delhi. I was very happy and satisfied with all the services. Even the flight was ahead of its schedule and the cabin crew was warm and the hospitality was just amazing. I'm again a loyal traveller with IndiGo now.,0
"I arrived at Melbourne from London with Emirates, and made my way to the Jetstar counter for the flight from Melbourne to Hobart. It was 3.50am on 30th December 2015. A Jetstar employee was walking towards me while I was standing at the counter, and I said ""excuse me"". She walked straight past me saying ""we open at 4"". I said ""I just want to...."" where she cut me dead with ""I said 4'o clock!"". She rounded this off with look of death. I can't believe Jetstar would put someone with her attitude anywhere near paying customers. I will never fly Jetstar again and next time I go to Australia (later this year) will go via Sydney.",1
"Phuket to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways. Avoid like the plague. Flight was rearranged with no real explanation. Contacted the customer service team who gave me conflicting information. I was left with no idea when the flight would be leaving and with nobody I could contact for the correct answer. Like many other reviewers have stated, pay the extra and go with a reputable airline.",1
Sydney-Hobart return - you get what you pay for although with all the add-ons the Jetstar fare isn't any cheaper really than QF or Virgin. The seating is cramped the aircraft was grubby inside tray table had sticky marks on it and the inflight magazines were quite grubby. We were two and a half hours late leaving Hobart with very short notice of delay which meant we had given up our hotel room only to spent mindless hours sitting around Hobart airport. Certainly won't use Jetstar again.,1
"The new seats were very small and not very comfortable. The old seats for the old A320-200 were a bit bigger and a bit more comfortable. For some reason the day I flew was a very nice day to fly but for some reason the turbulence was very extreme, the pilot had to cancel the distribution of meals because of it which I believe was not turbulence, it was the pilot using the plane on manual instead of using the autopilot. The flight was 50 minutes delayed but somehow made it 10 minutes late to its actual arrival time. I was happy for that but other than that it was the worst AirAsia experience. Note: The ticket was very cheap.",1
"I dont understand why the online check in line is always so much longer than the regular check in line. Also, why offer a smart check-in option only to get a piece of paper printed out saying please take boarding pass from the check in counter. This airline needs better and more efficient way of checking people in.",1
BOM-DEL-BOM. Boarding was swift and passengers greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight left on time and the service friendly with enough information was given by FA's. The flight on second leg was one hour late and IndiGo did manage to reach out passengers by sending SMS. Again friendly crew and clear information from FA's. The only downside is the food could be tastier. The food sold inflight has absolute no value of money and leg space is poor for an 188 cm man. I had to fit in and sit in slanting positing.,0
I flew round trip HNL-SYD in June on Jetstars 787 Dreamliner. Both flights were on time and found the plane very comfortable. I would recommend pre ordering your food. The flight crew only came through the cabin 3 times in a 10 hour flight. First serving pre order breakfast followed by beverage service. Five hours later for pre order lunch followed by snacks or lunch for purchase(if they had enough). Finally 1.5 hours prior to landing for pre order snakes and beverage service. I would also use Web Checkin and look for that queue at the airport. Overall very happy with Jetstar considering their low rates.,0
Well star class we all know - very average. But you get what you pay for. MEL-SIN. Flight delayed 1hr. The food they get in MEL is terrible compared what you get coming back from SIN. Service was ok. Seat are bad but hopefully when they get new aircraft's it will be lot better. The iPads they give you are boring. Overall it's a 7.5 hr flight - not that bad. We had another flight with Jetstar Asia to KL and they are just rude. I do that flight 6 times a year. But there cheap and they go to main airport not the Low cost one.,0
Vadadora to Mumbai. I had travel within India and saw that this was a viable airline. The planes are fairly nice and the service is good.  I have 2 separate reservations connecting in Mumbai. They would not put the luggage to my final destination or combine the tickets. Very frustrating...the discount way!,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Kualanamu. I was late and almost missed out on the boarding time. Luckily one of the shopper staff help me contact the AirAsia staff to reopen the gate due to I miss out the gate time before 15 min departure. Fortunately, at the end a member of AirAsia reopen the P5 gate so we do not miss out the flight. Thank you and this is much appreciated for everyone's helping hand.",0
"Goa to Singapore via Hubli and Bangalore. Big respect to the ground service crew of Indigo Airlines (Pratik, Tufeeq, Errana, Arpita and Sayed). They helped me big time at Hubli when I was landing from a flight from Goa. I lost my bag with my wallet (credit card, cash) in the airport Goa and realised the disaster when I was in Hubli, no wallet so no money, can't take the taxi to go to the hotel, it was midnight the airport was closing and the policemen started talking to me, big trouble, big time!! This is here than the amazing team of Indigo Airlines help me to get out of trouble. First, we went to the restaurant where they offered me a dish then they provided me a room for the night, on the morning they provided the breakfast, then they drove me to the city center where I was able to withdrawal some money through Western Union and finally drove me back to the airport at Hubli where I took my next flight to Bengaluru. Without their incredible help, I don't know what would have happened... so big thank you to all the team of Indigo Airlines.",0
"Delhi to Coimbatore. I have flown with Indigo loads of times and have regularly recommended it to many. I have never had a bad experience in all of my trips and was really happy until my recent trip. I had booked my seats under student discount which allowed an additional baggage of 10kgs free of charge. During my through leg from DEL to CJB, this promotion was honored and I paid for whatever excess I had, (excluding the 15kg+10kg allowance). But they would not agree that I had this promotion during my return leg and would not agree or believe me that I availed this in my first leg. I was astounded when the rep said there was nothing in the notes regarding the promotion. How can it be possible that you allow different baggage allocations for different legs. I ended up paying for the excess baggage which I had packed in anticipation of availing the 10 kg student discount. It was never about the money for me, but Indigo let me down in not acknowledging my promotion status.",1
"We booked a flight Sydney to Bali to fly on Easter Friday, 19/04/2019, months ago. Received a message from Jetstar last night that our flight was canceled ""due to engineering requirements"". Of course, one week before Easter Weekend there were no flights left for Thursday or Friday. ""Manage my booking"" section on Jetstar website still showed my flight as valid, so I couldn't even go and explore alternative flights myself. Had to call the customer service, who confirmed the flight had been canceled and suggested I fly out on Saturday as this is all they had left. I considered a refund to rebook with another airline, but since most of my initial purchase was paid via Jetstar gift card, they could only offer a refund in a form of Jetstar gift card! So now we have to fly on Saturday, it will take us 15 hours instead of 9, we are losing the whole 24 hours at the hotel, which cannot be refunded. The whole experience was just awful, I didn't expect Jetstar to act in such manner. Will do my absolute best to never fly with them again!",1
MNL-HKG-MNL. Everything is simple but efficient. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Cheap and affordable flights - worth the money. I would have loved to see a movie on board though. Something that they can probably venture into in the future. I recommend for short haul flights and if you are on a budget.,0
"Puerto Princesa to Shanghai via Manila. If I could give this airline a 0/10 I would.  Our flight in Puerto Princesa was supposed to leave by 4:30pm and but there were constant delays and we didnt end up leaving until 6:50. One of the passengers got sick on the flight and started throwing up. They made him pay for water. Our connecting flight was scheduled to leave at 8:20pm. We told the airline to please hold the plane for the 7 passengers who needed to go to Shanghai. They told us that they would do everything to make sure we get on the plane. That was a lie. When we arrived they didnt help us rush through immigration and we missed the closing of the doors by 5 minutes. They also told us the flight didnt leave yet and we can make it! That was a lie. We ran through the terminal as fast as we could. When we got to the gate there were two people at the gate The customer service pretended they didnt speak English until we started yelling. They didnt have a plan for us stranded passengers. They didnt have any reconnecting flights planned or hotel accommodations ready. They had no protocol for this situation and highly unprofessional. The made us wait in the airport for an extra 3 hours and tried to get strangers to room together in a hotel room. We didnt end up getting to the hotel until midnight, the same time we would have arrived in Shanghai if they just waited 5 minutes.",1
Flew with 2 others from KUL-PEN on 1/1/2013. Bought the Red Carpet service which was made the whole experience really good from check in to baggage claim. We got the seats we asked for (front row) and were very comfortable for the short flight. Friendly cabin crew. No complains at all about the flight.,0
"Flew economy Melbourne to Bangkok on one of Jetstar's new 787's. I've never previously flown international with Jetstar but have done so with AirAsia X, so in my mind I was comparing the two budget carriers. The whole process of checking in and boarding was smooth and easy starting from the automatic baggage drop off. Tuesday morning at Tullamarine was a breeze to get through customs. Boarding was on time. Seats were very comfortable and leg room didn't feel any different to the full service economy cabins I've flown with. My prebooked meal tasted great and the hot snack that came with it later in the fight also tasted good. Entertainment was no where near say Emirates standard but for a budget carrier the selection of movies were fantastic, especially when you consider other budget airlines don't even have seatback screens. I watched 3 new movies and that pretty much took me through the whole flight. We touched down in Bangkok 50 minutes ahead of schedule! After this flight Jetstar has definitely won my future business.",0
"Bali to Labuan Bajo. Immense high cost of checked baggage. Ultimately, we paid more for our luggage than for the flights. How much is the amount, we have learned only at the airport. Intransparent baggage policy The scheme is arbitrary - even the call center is obviously not informed. It was not possible to know in advance what the costs are. Very bad customer service. To 5 E-Mail inquiries I received until today no answer. There are several service numbers that no one answers. After the 11th attempt, I finally managed to reach one of the call centers. Unfortunately nobody could help me there any more. The staff can not speak English, but that's not the problem. Even a friend from Indonesia could not get valid information from the airline. For me, that's systematic and deliberate rip-off. The fact that the flight was delayed by more than three hours and we spent a total of 8 hours at the airport is no longer significant. There are many other airlines that are not or only slightly more expensive. Save the ordeal with Thai Lion Air and Bay another flight. DE:  Immens hohe Kosten fr aufgegebenes Gepck. Letztendlich haben wir fr unser Gepck mehr als fr die Flge gezahlt. Wie hoch der Betrag ist, haben wir erst am Flughafen erfahren. Intransparente Gepckpolicy Die Regelung ist willkrlich - selbst das Call Center ist offensichtlich nicht informiert. Es war nicht mglich vorab in Erfahrung zu bringen, welche Kosten entstehen. Sehr schlechter Kundenservice. Auf 5 E-Mail Anfragen habe ich bis heute keine Antwort erhalten. Es gibt verschiedene Servicenummern, auf die niemand antwortet. Nach dem 11. Versuch habe ich es schlielich geschafft eines der Call Center zu erreichen. Leider konnte mir dort auch niemand weiter helfen. Das Personal kann zwar kein Englisch, aber das ist gar nicht das Problem. Auch ein Freund aus Indonesien konnte keine validen Informationen von der Airline bekommen. Fr mich ist das systematische und bewusste Abzocke. Das der Flug dann noch ber drei Stunden Versptung hatte und wir insgesamt 8 Stunden am Flughafen verbracht haben, fllt gar nicht mehr ins Gewicht... Es gibt viele andere Airlines, die nicht oder nur wenig teurer sind. Erspart euch die Tortur mit Thai Lion Air und Bucht gleich einen anderen Flug...",1
Sydney to Denpasar. The crew seemed very disengaged smiled on entry then never again. Meals were tiny for a premium price. Rubbish from meals was not removed until just before landing. Drinks (coffee etc.) came around around 1 hr into the flight then not again unless you paged the stewards. No offer of water for the flight unless you called the stewards. They seemed uninterested in the passengers hiding in the middle /end prep areas. Seats were cramped and flight full. Return to Sydney was worse. All water was confiscated prior to boarding. Again flight crew seemed disinterested in the passengers and meals were as above. No water unless asked for. Unfortunate as all water taken before boarding by Bali inspection of bags at the loading gate.  The crew seemed unhappy or dissatisfied and gave the bare minimum of service. Again not happy with having to pay for everything including old TV shows and music. I'll never travel Jetstar again on any flight over 1hr.,1
"Arrived slightly late for this flight and was told it was on time and that check in had closed and I had to buy a new ticket. When I got to the gate I found out my original flight was in fact late but response was inadequate and uncaring. Boarding was late and when I finally got on I was told that the flight was full and I had to check in my carry on. When I told them I had a laptop in there I was told to take it out and sit with the laptop on my lap. I asked for a bag to put my computer in but got nothing. We waited an additional hour on the runway with no explanation. When I asked the steward he said ""I'm not sure maybe it's because they're backed up"". This was not the first time I've endured terrible delays and ridiculous responses from staff. I will never fly Lion again.",1
"Sydney to Denpasar. I have just had the worst experience ever on a Jetstar flight! Yesterday I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Bali around 5:45 pm. Firstly, I got a message from Jetstar about delay for 2,5 hours due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Then after arriving to the airport for 2,5 hours later as was said we had to wait for another hour to be seated. When all passengers were finally seated the pilot announced that there is a small problem regarding air conditioner and we needed to wait for technicians to fix it. 1 h later the pilot apologised again and announced that the problem was almost fixed and we were expecting to depart soonish. After 1 hour more which was in total 2 hours of waiting on a plane we were informed that we werent able to depart that day and were asked to leave the aircraft. Then the lady on a check in desk advised calling helpline to figure out what my next steps are. So I immediately contacted Jetstar and after chatting with a staff member of the helpline the nearest available flight which they could provide was in 4 days after my actual one which means that I am going to lose 5 days of my holidays! I understand that technical issues can happen but to not accommodate and suggest a flight that would arrive 5 days later is ludicrous! You have effectively ruined more then half of my holiday. I had to buy another ticket through another airline and also requested a refund for my canceled flight because there was no point of flying 4 days later. However, customer service said that they would not reimburse for my accommodation and transport (for the extra incurred directly arising from jetstars failure). I will never ever fly through Jetstar airline again. Yes they have lower price in comparison to Qantas for example but its not worth it. Indeed I paid for another expensive ticket to get to my destination as soon as possible losing 400$ in total for transport and accommodation and the most importantly my holiday time. I would strongly recommend staying away from this company. It is just a nightmare dealing with them!",1
"I had the best customer experience on this AirAsia flight flying from Manila to Cebu on 4th  September. Excellent inflight service and entertainment for the guests. Pleasant music played throughout the journey, food was very good plus an hitherto unseen entertainment for guests on flight. The airhostess(two of them) woke us all up by their energetic dance performance. This was followed by a quiz. Correct answers were awarded with AirAsia goodies. Perfect holiday experience.",0
"Pleasantly surprised with Jetstar. We are life members VIP of Qantas and only heard bad things about Jetstar. However our daughter who arranges our travel said try it. We were impressed. The staff were great, food excellent and good selection. The seats were very comfortable and while not lie flat beds they were still good. Well done Jetstar.",0
Was travelling (SYD-AVV 18/12/12 18.40) with my child so wanted to be one of the first to board so we could settle so we lined up early. This seemed to annoy the flight attendant and just as they were about to announce the boarding she asked me to check the bag size using the gauge they have for that purpose. I picked up the larger of our 2 bags that were on the floor side-by-side and halfway there she said not that one the other one. It was a standard luggage bag that she would have known was in regulation size and visually you could see it was the smaller of the two. As soon as I left the now-formed queue she turned her back and did not even look at what I was doing. It's obviously a game they play.,0
Flew the new 787 from MEL to AKL and selected the J seat although it was only Y service. Very dirty and grubby plane esp for such a new aircraft (the carpet was appalling). Had flown Jetstar J before and knew what to expect but the seat seemed less comfy but maybe it was my imagination. Service wasn't an issue for us as the flight is only 3 hrs but I have to say that if was crammed into a Y seat for 9 hrs to Asia I would understand how the convicts must have felt coming out to Australia. All in all had low expectations which were met. Did like the 787 as an aircraft and look fwd to seeing them on QF services one day in the future.,1
"Horrible experience, I had 3 flights with Cebu Pacific while on vacation, but every flight was delayed by more than 3 hours, with no or very general excuse. It ruined our vacation, since we lost many hours due to delays, and also missed connecting flight with Air Asia, which caused havoc in our plans. Flight itself was okay, no issues, but the delays are so annoying.",1
"We are from Canada and planned to visit our daughter in Melbourne, Australia. We spent a week in Kona, Hawaii before heading to Australia on Qantas airlines (and they are worth every penny). Our daughter found us a return flight direct from Melbourne to Honolulu on Jetstar as we planned to rest up a few days there before heading back to Canada. Our flight was to leave at 3:50 pm on April 9 and get into Honolulu at 6:15 am. Allowing enough time to clear customs, we booked a flight from Honolulu to Kona at 10:01 am. My husband got up at 4:30 AM and checked his email where he had one from Jetstar advising our flight had been cancelled due to engineering problems. He waited in a long queue for an online chat to rebook, only to find out that they could get us on a flight on April 12 - three days later and would put us up in a hotel for 1 night. As we had island tours booked and paid for in Kona (we had booked on our earlier trip) we needed to get there on the original day we booked. They refunded us our money but would do nothing else to compensate us for the additional cost of flights - Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Honolulu, and change our flights from Honolulu to Kona. Believe me, there are no discounts when you book on the same day you travel so we incurred lots of additional costs. I can't review the actual flight because I have never flown on them, and never will.",1
"Third time flying with Scoot, from Sydney to Singapore. New Boeing 787-900 was clean and comfortable. I like the larger size windows and you can adjust the tinting. Crew friendly and efficient. Did not pre purchase any food but you can buy onboard. The adjustment I would like to see is perhaps complimentary water. There is no inflight entertainment so take that into consideration on the 7-8hr trip and plan ahead. Return flight was also good, but the late departure out of Singapore at 1.45am is quite tiring. Scoot CEO was on board and crew took opportunity to invite passengers to have photos taken with them and their CEO.  Overall, I like Scoot as a low cost airline and if you keep this in mind and not expect a full service airline (ie: pay as you go) you shouldn't be too disappointed.",0
"This has got to be the worst airline in the history of aviation industry. Absolutely apathetic ground crew, and there is zero understanding of customer service concept. You get what you pay for - cheap airlines, cheap service, and I would never have taken this airline except that it was the only direct flight to Bali. Other airlines are twice as expensive, and glad to spend that money to interact with humans. Air Asia service is like a glorified AI BOT.",1
Sydney to Phuket. Please avoid this airline at all cost. The cancellations and flight delays will end up costing you much much more as we had to rebook flights with other airlines to get home.,1
Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. We booked 6 months before and we got a very good price lower than many others. True that you need to pre-book your meals and baggage allowance. But all went smoothly. The quality of their service is very satisfactory! However selling food and Duty free items on board is bit unprofessional.,1
"Booked and paid for a flight on AirAsia a month before travelling. The night before our flight to Phuket (less than 8 hours) we were informed our flight was cancelled. We were offered a full refund, or rebook on another flight. We had a commitment in Phuket so chose the refund and purchased tickets on another airline. Sent everything for the refund. Nothing happened. Talked to their live chat Oct 21 and was told my refund was in process. It is now February 4 2017 and after waiting in a live chat queue for 62 minutes I was told they are dealing with massive requests and are sorry for the delay - 4 months of delay! They have no clue as to when I might expect a refund. They don't handle that. I asked for an email to send a complaint to and was given the e-form. Already had written them but no response.",1
"I had requested for a wheelchair. In Mumbai, the ground crew told me my name was not in the list and they cannot provide me wheelchair. The inflight food was inadequate, a bun was given, but without butter. When asked, the hostess told we don't provide butter.  Though there was plenty of time to descend and the seat belt sign was turned off, the crew would not allow usage of the restroom.",1
"I was hesitant at first to book with Scoot because of the bad reviews online. I was convinced by my travel agent to book anyways despite all. I was very happy with my experience with Scoot. I travelled with my family and I wanted it to be the best experience since it was our first time to travel together. Staff were wonderful, food were great, comfortable seat, clean & they were on time. No hassles! The reason its 9 out of 10 because of the schedule change from my original booking. No harm done, then we have extra time to walk around ""The Jewel"" at Singapore airport. I will fly again & again with Scoot!!",0
"Bangkok to Surat Thani. Booked a flight for my girlfriend to meet me in Bangkok, my flight was cancelled so Ive asked Air Asia to credit my BIG Member account I received a case No, Ive been non stop on there chat system which is a waste of time, telephone Nos do not connect. The airline customer support is a total disgrace considering the coronavirus situation, they take your money for your ticket but you try and contact them is a disaster, they give no thought for anyone. I have used them before many times, but now see how they treat customers, no chance of getting credit back, very sad company.",1
"My sister and I had booked an AirAsia flight from Phuket to Bangalore which had a 11-hour layover in Bangkok so that we could visit Bangkok for a few hours. In spite of explaining our intent, we were sent by AirAsia staff in Phuket to immigration for exit, which ended up with us reaching Bangkok and being told to stay in the airport for 11 hours! A big shout out to the AirAsia staff in Bangkok who understood what happened and she made us meet the immigration staff in Bangkok, got the exit stamp on our passports reversed and resulted in letting us experience Wat Pho! We had to go through the immigration exit process again which was as per the immigration rules.",0
Flew from MAA to PNQ on 4th October. Check went on smooth. The flight was on time. The sandwich served onboard was excellent. Very clean and new aircraft. The flight arrived ahead of scheduled time. Overall wonderful experience. I would definitely fly with them again.,0
10/1/15-17/1/15. QZ547 and QZ 544. My husband and I travelled on Air Asia Perth to Denpasar return last week and the flights were fine. The Perth to Denpasar flight left 30 minutes early and as it wasn't a full flight my husband was able to stretch out and have a sleep. The Denpasar to Perth flight was full but once again there were no issues. The flight attendants did their jobs competently. I would definitely recommend Air Asia for short trips.,0
In the last month my husband and I went on 4 Air Asia flights. It was a mixed experience. The inflight entertainment is very limited. Whilst some of the service was good and they were generally courteous there were inconsistencies across the board. We paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. But on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy. An experience which has really left a very poor taste in my mouth was having a check in lady be very rude and abrupt with my husband.,1
"I am the last person to complain about cheap airlines. You get what youre paying for, so I am not really expecting great perks, comfort, or customer service as long as they get me safely to my destination. Thats the deal. However, I wont stand dishonest and cheating businesses and Scoot is a great example of that. On my last trip with them, I was told upon checking in, that I had 11 euro credit on my account and the lady at the counter was not able to give me my ticket till I pay. She did not tell me what this payment was for (I asked, but she didnt know) and redirected me to the cashier (who was supposed to give me all the details). There, again, I was told that he didnt know any details of the payment (sort this out directly with the airline), just that I need to pay. So 2 hours before my flight to Australia I was running back and forth between two Scoot desks to find out what was this about with no luck, no one gave me any info. I was nave enough to think that this was probably just a system issue  I gave up and paid, I thought I would resolve the issue with customer service afterward. Wow, how stupid I was. I sent the refund request via Scoot website explaining the situation. I got the reply that the charge was for the seat selection, which I apparently requested and on which I was apparently informed. So, now I am on my 5th complaint email, saying that I have never requested a seat and they are saying that I had. I ended up paying for the service I have never received, and they do not even have the decency to take responsibility for their mistakes.",1
Flew with Thai Air Asia from Yangon via Bangkok to Siem Reap and from Saigon via Bangkok back to Yangon. The only major problem was when we had to check in a bag (15kg) in Saigon for a whopping US$72. It was more than I paid for my ticket. Service not bad planes are clean and FAs are friendly. Bought food for US$6 - extremely small portion and not worth it.,0
Bangalore to Mumbai. My flight 6E 464 was scheduled for departure at 9:20am on 30 December and is finally boarding at 3:45 pm. In between this many flights for Mumbai has flown and Indigo crew remained clueless about this particular flight and spoke rude to passengers who we're enquiring. After the delay till 2:40pm the airline stopped sending any information to passengers via SMS or call.  At some point we were thinking as if we were waiting for some imaginary flight!  The refreshments were announced only at 12:30pm when most passengers had arranged their meals.,1
"Singapore to Melbourne. Scoot rescheduled my original flights in October 2019 to an entire day later for Both my outbound and inbound flights. This was totally unsuitable for me so I tried to find a different flight that flew on the same days but there were no longer any Scoot flights. Alternative options would be on different airlines. As I had made my booking through a travel agent, nothing was offered to me, even though I paid the same amount than I would direct. Not even to accommodate me on a partner airline (something I believe would have been offered IF i'd booked direct) and I'm left to bear the cost of something that was entirely on the blame of the airlines. Call Support center staff were not helpful at all and kept directing us to email in (from previous experiences, this never gets responded to on time and help is minimal). I think their customer service is really horrendous and they provide nothing of value when customers are in urgent need. Even as a budget carrier, the very least you could do is train your customer service officers so they know what to do and not shifting the blame elsewhere.",1
"Da Nang to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. Got to check in, after listening to at least five other passengers have a variety of arguments, to start our discussion. The system allocates seats automatically. We are a couple that booked together and the system had us at opposite ends of the plane and the only way to change this is to pay - and surprisingly the only seats available were the most expensive ones. So another $24USD to be paid. This is obviously done to generate another income stream.",1
"We had to go Indore for a family function and on this particular flight, we had checked in online and as the fare booked was a corporate fare the seat selection was free. At Bangalore airport, there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues. Also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes, one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access. This is also something I experienced first hand and was very valuable. The boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking, one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage. I selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time. The food was pretty decent along with the tea. Staff service was prompt and polite. Arrival was 30 mins ahead of schedule which was appreciated and the crew was wearing a smile on their faces even while de-boarding and thanking the passengers. Overall could not have asked for anything better.",0
"First time flying Jetstar International, were flying from OOL (Gold Coast) to Wellington. Have heard some pretty average reviews with Jetstar for a little while. Considering Gold Coast to Wellington is a new route for Jetstar I was expecting a fair bit of turning in the air. We had also flew Wellington to Gold Coast when we were coming to Gold Coast, surprisingly we had the same Head Pilot for both flights, very friendly! Around 1/2 way through the flight the food cart came around, we were quite lucky because they told us each and every one in our family had $10 vouchers. In the end we couldn't even spend $40 on food! Staff were really friendly and was a beautiful day to travel. We landed in Wellington 30 minutes early.",0
"We took the Chennai-Bagdogra flight through Indigo. Booked well in advance under a deal and it is 100% worth every penny. From the ease of web check in to boarding, the IndiGo staff were very friendly. The journey was very comfortable, aircraft relatively new, flight stewardess were very friendly. Flight departure/arrival were on time. During the hop at Kolkata, we were even allowed to visit the cockpit and the captain demonstrated the functionalities. I never expected this kind of treatment, and we were very satisfied overall with Indigo. Even our return journey to Chennai was again with IndiGo, which again is very pleasing experience overall for us.",0
Chennai to Delhi in economy. Pretty short flight so it's hard to complain. Comfortable seats good service and we left and arrived right on time. We were 2kg over (in 2 bags) but staff let it pass. Would fly Indigo again.,0
BKK-CNX-BKK and BKK-DPS-BKK booked a year in advance for a bargain price during their annual promotion. 2 out of 4 flights were delayed by about 1 hour. Service onboard was good with friendly crew who were available throughout the flights. Seats were tight but bearable even for the 4.5 hour flight BKK-DPS. Baggage delivery was fast with less than 20 min waiting time on each sector. FD is nothing fancy you won't get pampered but if you can get a cheap fare and don't mind an occasional delay then Air Asia is the way to go.,0
"After being slightly annoyed that AirAsia rescheduled our departure time to an hour later, they got us to Kuala Lumpur and we made our connection in plenty time. Was made to wait in a massive que when I only had hand luggage to have my ""documents checked"" when I arrived at the desk I was told that I should of gone straight to security, I was far from impressed but the onboard crew were great as per usual!",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. AirAsia, considering it is a budget airline, were perfectly good. You know what you're getting and pretty much all the time thats what you receive. KLIA Terminal 2 (LCC) is a bit of a let down, it's already showing 'cracks' and it's still very new. Processing through the airport is normally fast and efficient, the shops and restaurants are excellent but once airside the skyways, travelators etc. are poor, depending on which gate you're at the walk can be ridiculously long! Food on board if great value, and if you prebook choice is also excellent, better than some main stream national carriers I've used!",0
"Cebu to Manila. Constant delays on every flight I have had with them. Not only were we delayed at our airport of origin, we were delayed on the ground in our destination as well - we had to remain seated for more than 45 minutes because of the disorganization of this company. An absolute joke to say the least, spend your money elsewhere or you will regret your decision.",1
I rebooked my flight because of family bereavement. My original booking was upgraded to business class from yellow coloured seat I booked earlier. I paid the penalty for my flight Gold Coast to Singapore. Less than 12 hours before my flight I realized that my seat allocation had gone. Not only the business class upgrade but also the yellow coloured seat. If I want to return to my original seat I have to pay again 14 Singapore dollars which I am not happy to do but no choice. What surprises me is that Scoot can give yellow coloured seat number 52 for free but not my original seat number 23. It just does not make sense to me. First I lost my seat allocation and upgrade to business class now Scoot asked me for SGD 14 at the last minute. I won't be flying Scoot again. It is useless to be a loyal Scoot flyer.,1
"Booked Sydney Flight JQ508 it was set to depart at 9.15am and the flight was delayed 3hrs with no communication to customers. There was no text, email or updates google stating 3hr delay. The delays ruined plans for the day and no compensation to make up for the delay. Customer service was rude, arrogant and had 0 empathy for the inconvenience & damage caused to customers. Flights departing at 11am to Sydney departed earlier than the 9.15am Sydney flight. No compensation provided. Ridiculous airline avoid at all costs.",1
Flew SYD-MNL return for $144 (AUD) return bargain of a deal. Having flown AirAsia many times I knew the standards of a low cost airline it was pretty much the same. The planes were very quiet (new Airbus A330-300) seats were a little bit smaller and not as comfortable (harder) than AirAsia seats also the recline angle was not as generous but for the price and short distance who cares? A little over cautious on the final security check at the gate on our return flight from MNL total unnecessary (probably not their fault though but rather a requirement set by the Australian Government same thing happens in KL for example). This meant a delayed departure of about 40min they should have allocated more time prior to boarding. Would I fly with them again yes if you love the Philippines and don't care about 'proper airline' service then why not I could even see myself pay $600 for a flight beats flying to KL and then onwards. There are a few other operational procedures they should iron out but fairly satisfied.,0
"Had a flight 2.9.22 18:55 to Kuala Lumpur - I'm there an hour early - sitting at my Gate 6a it says very clearly 18:55 DPS-KUL AirAsia at the Gate. I go to board they tell me my flight its the other flight at 18:55 AirAsia to Kuala Lumpur at Gate 2 but its already left. I go to the other gate explain, they say its my fault because I didnt go to the live checkin. And had I done the online checkin properly I would have seen. This is the text on the online ticket: ""you may proceed directly to the gate using this e-boarding pass"". The employee said there were tickets available the same day, but until I admitted it was my fault he would not give me one for today but instead for tomorrow.  I have never ever experienced anything close to this. In the end luckily I managed to get a ticket for the same day but had to pay the difference.",1
There is no way to actually speak to a person all the telephone numbers in all the countries I've tried go to a voicemail service.  They happily take your money when you book a flight but after that there is no way to change flights or talk to someone. There is an email type voicemail service even that they take 2 days to reply back you.,1
"Singapore to Sydney. Terrible, avoid at all costs TR2 route, the plane had issues had to exit the plane and reboard another. I'd rather poke my eyes out than fly Scoot ever again. Zero communication from crew. I'd rate this company zero out of ten, but it won't allow it so 1 star it is. Avoid at all costs.",1
"I travelled with my sister, my elderly parent and my toddler son taking Scoot from Haikou to Singapore. The journey was a pleasant one despite the episode of my child became very unwell, alternating between drowsy and cranky in the mid of the journey. We sought the crew for help. They are very professional, helpful and friendly. They checked us out first, discussed with their captain and then prep us on the travel duration and preparation on ground. Besides, they offered ice pack/wet kitchen towels along the way. Nearing to the destination, they even moved me and my son to the front row. The flight arrived 20 minutes earlier. After that, they connected me and my son with the ground crew Firliza who accompanied us to airport clinic for medical treatment.",0
Pilot's seat belt got stuck before departure from Sunshine Coast to Sydney. No one to fix it. Closest Jeststar engineer located in Brisbane 3 hours away. Flight delayed for 6 hours! No offer of any support from the airline.,1
"Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I was travelling in New Zealand and I received an email from Jetstar informing me that my flight on 4th December to Kuala Lumpur had been cancelled. There was no back-up plan nor any other flight options made available except to call the customer service team. The next available flight was the following day  the 5th (the original date I booked) and which we were told that we could confirm our presence 3 hours prior to the departure time. We called back 12 hours later and we were told that nothing could be done because the flight is now full. We needed to wait for 2 more days for the next available flight. When we asked if we could book other tickets back to Kuala Lumpur with the cost fully reimbursed the customer service answered that this is subject to the approval from the claims department. It is obvious that booking flights at such a last minute will be extremely costly, which defeats the purpose of purchasing the cheap fares from Jetstar months in advance. So no flight, no other options, except to accept the refund of the money paid or wait for the next flight out. To add on, the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful. Upon checking-in in New Zealand for our flights back to Melbourne, we spoke to the customer service at the airport. In less than 15 minutes, they confirmed 2 seats for us for the 5th December which was what we have been told that the flight was full. Fast forward to the day of the flight (2 days later)  once again another frustrating e-mail which stated a delay in the flight from 1200 hour to 1350 hour. Bearing in mind that we have a transit at the Singapore airport, the email stated arrival time to be 1840 hour whilst the departure from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was at 1945 hours. However on the plane, the captain announced that the ETA was at 1930. Logically speaking, we expected that the Jetstar crew would have had the information for passengers who are transiting in Singapore for the KL flight. Hence, they would have been aware that the Melbourne flight was delayed thus wait for these us to arrive. On our way there we even heard them calling out name, so I immediately stop by the information counter to request for them to hold the gate as our flights were delayed. The gate was closed when we arrived. We explained ourselves, but once again nothing could be done despite already having our boarding pass in hand. They even checked our seat numbers but still the same answer. At the transfer counter, I was told by the airport staff that the flight we had just missed was the last flight out. And to top it all, the representative only showed up after close to 2 hours later. No apologies, nothing. It was as if nothing had happened and we should be thankful for the arrangements made. When it was our turn, he quickly briefed us on the flight to be taken then next day and the accommodation provided for the night. I asked if we had any other options and all he answered was no because that was the last flight and that is all they can do. I even asked if we could book any other available flight and get Jetstar to reimburse the full cost. The answer is yes, but the next available flight was at 2145 hour when it was already 2120 hour.",1
Flight cancelled by airline shortly before flight but refund not received. Calling or chatting to human is impossible and AI bot gives irrelevant answers but doesn't solve your issue. Then after that says my details can not be verified or time limit is up so cut you off repeatedly even if you try different ways to refer.,1
"I am writing to express my frustration at Jetstar Airways online booking system for Special needs passengers. My mother is 91 years of age and we have travelled many times with Jetstar. My mother requires a wheelchair for each flight, however when I have booked on-line and requested a wheelchair, there is no warning that tells me that one is not available on that flight. It is not until I receive the email that the wheelchair symbol is missing. So I am left with a paid booking and no wheelchair. How simple it would be to have a warning whilst doing the booking to let me know to choose another flight time. This has caused my mother great distress.",0
Bandung to Pekanbaru on 9th December. At the time I bought the tickets scheduled for 3.40 pm but 3 days prior to departure the schedule suddenly changed to 5.35 am. A very disappointing change.,1
"My vacation flight is hassle-free for the first time, flying with Cebu Pacific. On-time take off and we arrived early than the estimated time. I hope you can keep it up.",0
"Cebu to Surigao. This airline is shockingly bad. I have never had a flight with Cebu Pacific that has flown on time. I have even had the first flight of the day at 5:20am delayed by an hour (they switched us to another plane on the tarmac). We watched our luggage sit on the tarmac getting rained on even though they have plastic covers to stop this happening the ground crew simply do not care, they were nice and dry hiding under the plane instead of fixing whatever issue was causing delay. My luggage also now has yellow paint and scratches all over it and my padlocks are scratched as well presumably this is from contact with the tarmac at some stage. When leaving Cumiguin our flight was delayed 2 hours, check in staff took this extra time to pedantically weigh each item and charge for overweight baggage, selectively charging foreigners more than locals and allowing some but not others to have more than 1 bag as carry on and charging extra for checking these bags in. When boarding us onto the plane they walked us past the engine while it was running, the noise from the turbine engine was deafeningly loud and high pitched. The seats are uncomfortable and inflight service is non existent. There is nothing good about this airline, I will never fly with them unless there is no other option.",1
"Bali to Seoul via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia sent us an email the morning of our flight stating that they pushed back our departure. We contacted the customer service chat and tried to resolve the issue. The initial agent said that they would put us on an earlier flight out of our current location, however, they failed to provide us a case number. Additionally, they stated that the flight change would be processed in 2 to 3 hours, which is ridiculous. We had to contact a second customer service agent through their chat service. They then provided us with our case number but reiterated that they could not expedite our flight change any faster than the 2 to 3 hours quoted by the initial agent. When we asked if there was a number we could call the agent stated that they are in the process of closing all of their call centers. They did nothing to ease the stress of having a last-minute flight change that would make us miss a day of work. This was unhelpful and led to the last few hours of our vacation being stressful and having to re-arrange multiple plans. Definitely not good customer service.",1
"SUB-KUL-HKT-CNX-KUL-SUB. SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes. I am not going to fly Air Asia again unless I have no other choice.",1
"Delhi to Amritsar. The worst airline Ive travelled! My luggage wheel was broken and the ground personnel at the luggage collection area was of little help. Though I told her that I do not need any compensation and I just need a note to make a travel insurance claim, she was not able to help me. The manager intervened and suggested to write an email. He promised that I would get a response. This happened on my domestic flight on 6 Dec. I did as I was told - wrote three emails and I received exactly the same computer-generated reply from 2 different customer service officers. I had left my contactable number and I have neither heard from them via phone or email. Please do not be fooled by their advertisements - I would never travel on this airline again.",1
"Flight Attendants were good but their guest experience / customer service team is horrible. Long wait time and generic responses and lack of empathy, Being in customer service, emotional intelligence is important. Another thing to note - if they offer you travel vouchers due to flight cancellations or rescheduling, BE Careful. They misrepresented by not telling me full info when I opted for voucher and when I tried to redeem a $20 meal, they took my flight amount.",1
I regularly fly Jetstar from Newcastle to Brisbane. Not my favourite airline - much prefer Qantas - but from Newcastle usually Jetstar offers the schedule that fits my plans. Its a budget airline so you get what you pay for and it is short flight so the cramped conditions are tolerable. Would be nice if the food and beverages included a couple of healthier options. In summary - if you have to fly Jetstar it is tolerable but if given the option pay a little more and fly with Qantas.,0
"Bali to Dubai via Manila. Just want to give people a heads up if theyre flying internationally with Cebu Pacific! We had a 9.5 hour flight from Manila to Dubai. Please be aware that theres no comfort/service at all. Make sure you buy enough water at the airport/refill to keep yourself hydrated on this long flight. You have to pay to get water otherwise and youll pay twice the price for half the amount of water you can buy at the airport. If you are like me, and dont like the food on planes in general, have a decent meal at the airport and load up on snacks for during your flight. Prepare yourself for no inflight entertainment! No screens, no movies! Make sure your devices are charged, have a fully charged power bank and things to watch etc. Or you can bring a book/get book on pdf on your phone. Theres WiFi but you have to pay and I dont know if its any good. You dont get a pillow and a blanket so make sure to bring your own or something similar to make you feel a bit comfortable.",1
"Business Class on Jetstar is relatively inexpensive so I am making some allowance for this, never the less, it was excellent for the price. Possibly the business class on the B787 international is better than business Class Jetstar on smaller and domestic planes? My wife has flown Jetstar business class on older planes before and she thought this would be a waste of money. It wasn't. We had faster check in, boarding, movement through security All good. We had additional luggage included and it was more than enough for our needs. Welcomed on board with a glass of bubbles/fruit juice choice and packet of nibbles. Seats A1 and A2. Also got a small but useful comfort kit that included a blow up neck pillow, light blanket, eye shade, socks and lip balm.  Comfortable seats with good recline. Being A1 and A2 we had loads of room in front. The foot rest though was poor and cut across the back of the calves. Using my backpack was much better and others in our cabin seemed to be doing the same. The seat and footrest settings were stiff and difficult to use but staff arrived immediately and fixed this. The staff were excellent. We received a menu and a staff member discussed it with us and took our choices. Main meal and breakfast. Main meal. main course was gnocchi. To dry and the balls were too hard. It needed a more liquid sauce. Came with a choice of reasonable quality red and white wines. Other snacks and wines available during the flight if required. Breakfast was quite good with a range of choices and decent coffee. Not up to regular business class meals but considerably better than economy flights. Again, we were happy considering the price. Noise cancelling headphones provided. Small but OK range of films and music etc available. The new Elvis was one of these. Flight map and info available. Bus class had our own toilet, shared with crew. We were 20 minutes late leaving but arrived over 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Jetstar gets lots of bad reviews. Not this flight however which exceeded our most optimistic expectations.",0
"Extremely poor customer service and attempting to profit off a pandemic! My experience with Jetstar has been completely sub optimal. My flight has been cancelled - and despite multiple attempts and hours and hours waiting for live chat or email response, they finally get back and say they can only provide a voucher. This is really a weak offering given every other airline for my trip provided refunds with no questions asked. Then, the most laughable part of all - their voucher is only valid for 6 months! They refuse to adjust the policy. How am I meant to plan and book a trip in the next 6 months with this level of uncertainty and borders being closed? They are trying to gauge passengers. It's despicable. I will never fly Jetstar Airways and I will ensure that my friends, family and community are advised of this behavior. Do not support such a crooked airline. Its businesses like these that deserve to go under during these times, all of my support will go to airlines that also did their best to service their customer and meet needs and expectations. I will be happy to book time and time again on those other airlines.",1
"Hobart - Melbourne - Perth. Hobart to Tullamarine on a fairly new A320. Aircraft was pretty clean and tidy and me and my wife got our allocated seats. Flight was on time happy to say. JQ968 Tullamarine to Perth was a different story. Check in manager very rude even after I produced my ASIC and advised her that I was fully aware of the conditions of being in an exit row. Inexcusable behaviour. Flight was out on time on a new A320 but I cannot understand the cabin crew. A person should not do a job like this if they are not cut out to do it. Sure the flight was a ""red eye"" and as a frequent flyer I can accept that this can affect your moods. But the fact that one staff member (Cabin Manager) was putting meals on the floor another male member of staff (who conveniently wore no name tag) was slamming around and making as much noise as he possibly could. He was on a mission not to let passengers sleep. And then the lot of them standing there and complaining about their jobs - well you get the picture. Paid a full fare for this flight and in my view if this is the way Jetstar operates their business they do not deserve any of the domestic market. Will never use them again.",1
"Booked 7 flights with AirAsia around 4 months before my holiday. Around 2 month before the flights were supposed to take place the nightmare started. They started to cancel flights for ""technical reasons"" sometimes offering alternatives that were not too bad (same route, just a couple of hours earlier or later), sometimes they offered nothing. In the end of the 7 flights only 2 happened within 1h of the originally booked time. The highlight was a flight that was cancelled and begrudgingly I agreed to their alternative which was 14h earlier. After having re-arranged the other flights this affected, a couple of weeks before the flight, the alternative was moved to within 2h of the original flight's time. Even days before the flights they kept moving them around making my heart sink every time I got a message from AirAsia with the word urgent in the title. Their customer service chatbot is making it impossible to talk to a human or hand in a claim, you just go in circles with it offering you useless options. The positives were that if it was other AirAsia flights that were affected by these cancellations it was pretty painless to move them around and most of the flights were punctual.",1
"My last 3 Jetstar Airways flights between Melbourne and Sydney have all been delayed by 90 minutes, 4 hours and 60 minutes and counting. I don't care how cheap fares are, because airlines are in the business of customer service irrespective of price. The apologies are not internalised as it appears Jetstar system doesn't work. Off to try another budget carrier",1
"I took AirAsia AK854 flight from Kuala Lumpur to CNX, it was very empty for this morning flight. The crew provide excellence services and we landed 20 minutes before schedule. A typical flying experience with AirAsia value fare obtained.",0
Queenstown to Melbourne. Jetstar reason for cancelling our flight is they had to divert and refuel in Wellington. From Queenstown. From there they told us to get our own accommodation at 950pm in Queenstown and offered only $150 refund for 1 room - which would not cover the cost. They also emailed us a refund form to fill out and fax back - are you kidding me. Its the 21st century who uses fax! I had long term parking which they don't cover the cost for and then they delayed our rescheduled flight the next day! At 12pm! And offered us 1 meal voucher! 1! Absolutely appalling. They don't care about you - do not fly with them.,1
Delhi to Bengaluru. The flight was supposed to depart at 9:35 am but was delayed to 12:35pm. Me and my husband had a Goair flight to catch from Bengaluru to Kannur at 14:40 hrs. Firstly we missed the Kannur flight and secondly the flight took off from Delhi after another 1.5 hrs delay. No screening of appropriate timings or scheduled departure. No announcements to confirm delays. We were rerouted to Mangalore but had to stay in Mangalore without any compensation.,1
Having found a promotion fare from CNX-MFM I thought I would try the latest destination out of Chiang Mai. I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau. It quickly became apparent as most of the pax were in a tour group from mainland china. Standard Air Asia service although this time I booked a hotseat and had a nice chicken lasagne. Flight was 30 mins early. No jetway at MFM but the walk in fact makes getting to immigration easier. Next to the airport is a new jetfoil service to Hong Kong.,0
Langkawi-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KUL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for the time end of April. Meal was very good. Staff on board very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a normal. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.,0
I booked a Manila to Iloilo flight for 1120am. It got rescheduled due to operational issues to 730pm. Then I get another notification that it is rescheduled to 830pm. I am keeping my fingers crossed that I don't get rescheduled a 4th time though I would not be surprised. I filed a complaint on chat. The agent responded like a bot.  Overall very poor. All the prior reviews I read were not kidding.,1
"Lion Air (operated by Wings Air) Flight from Bali to Lombok was cancelled and then delayed for 6 hours. Check in and boarding processes were chaotic. Information updates were either non existent met with shrugs or told anything to keep us ""satisfied"". Similar experience on return flight but only 3.5 hours late. Avoid these two airlines at all costs.",1
"Bangkok to Manila. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I am a Filipina and I love my country. However, this is one of the things I become ashamed of. Cebu Pacific, you need to do a better job. Your lack of organization will put someone's career in the brink. For all the 4 flights I had with was all in delay. I could have missed my flight to go back to Germany and might cause me in deep trouble.",1
"My husband and I flew with AirAsia from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. It was a fantastic experience! The online check was easy and quick, and the baggage check was completely automated and seamless. The onboard staff was very friendly. The flight landed 30 minutes early. Definitely recommended.",0
"Melbourne to Phuket. Once we got going the flight was great, however we suffered a 10hr delay due to a breakdown, an then another 45 minutes while the plane was cleaned. We were offered a $50.00 Jestar voucher as compensation and told to claim any other out of pockets from our insurance, I think that this is pretty poor. While Jetstar calls this business class it really should be called for what it is and that is premium economy, meals where good and staff were attentive and it is far better than sitting at the back of the plane. The price and service was similar to a premium economy ticket on Qantas or Singapore Airlines, however even despite being called business class their is no priority luggage with Jetstar.",1
The AirAsia Indonesia flight from Kualanamu to Kuala Lumpur was slightly delayed (20 mins.) as it was late from the previous sector. The first officer welcomed the passengers on board and gave information on the flight prior to departure. The captain addressed the passengers during the flight regarding current flight information and expected time of arrival. The cabin crew were nice and worked hard all the way. The flight was smooth except for a few small bumps on descend. The landing was okay.,0
"Premium/Business class in the month of August KL - Seoul Busan - KL. Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage. It is not that exclusive anyway economy class passenger can just walk pass you anytime anyhow.",1
"Not for the first time have I had issues with poor staffing in the terminals, especially at Kuala Lumpur. On the way to Bangkok I was sent to the wrong gate by their concierge. Only to experience a last minute gate change which left me having to run a few kilometers or miss the flight. The worst was to come with the return to Perth flight. Having caught the Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur leg of the connecting flight I arrived at Kuala Lumpur airport with approximately 2 hrs and 15 minutes to spare. Within the Kuala Lumpur baggage claim my baggage was lost/held up and was the last to go down the carousel with one package missing. Going to lost and oversized baggage claim area the officer had to trace where my luggage was which took a very long time. That said I rushed to the AirAsia departure area and asked the customer support which line I must join for baggage drop as they have no visual clues except alphanumerical clues. I was advised to join a the W line, after 15 minutes of waiting an officer asked me where I am going to which I replied Perth, Australia. He informed that I should be in the Y line. I rushed around to the Y line, with yet another group of travellers processing massive packages, that done I get to drop my bags to be told the baggage checkin has just closed. I can not catch the connecting flight. When I asked who I may speak to in this regard I was told an officer would be present in about 3 hours. I waited for the officer and presented my case about the luggage being held up, being sent to the wrong drop off point and missing the flight. I was told it was my fault for catching those flights and that I would have to pay more for myself and my luggage for the next flight. I explained that this was an AirAsia to AirAsia connection sold by Trip.com",1
MEL-BKK in economy on B787. Sort of your typical Jetstar experience. Cramped cabin little leg room nickel and dimed for everything. Add to this the fact that the in seat power and overhead reading light wasn't working (despite a few reset attempts) and it added up to a fairly unremarkable experience. Jetstar has also changed their check in for international flights at MEL adding slick new kiosks which generate boarding passes and baggage tags. All well and good however there is no longer a separate queue for online check ins necessitating a long wait in the single check in queue. Absolutely no value to a customer to check in online now - don't waste your time. Mostly Thai-based crew was pleasant and efficient and the flight was about 30 minutes early into BKK so that made up for the deficiencies I suppose.,1
"Male to Mumbai. 3hr flight with 1 class only - no premium or business. Crew is very nice and service oriented although its a low cost airline. We booked what they called 6E - food, drinks and priority during tickets reservation. We got a rice (spicy) and soft drinks. I would not say it was good and for our kids they served the same - so it was kind of waste if time and money - no entertainment on board.",1
BKK-MNL-BKK twice in the past 4 months. On time departures and arrivals on all flights. No problems with ticketing and some very good prices to be had compared to PAL and Thai. Usual zoo of a check-in in BKK with people messing around with excess baggage and not being prepared to pay for it. MNL much better. No real complaints with Cebu Pacific - good value and I'll continue to use them.,0
"From the moment we started boarding the plane at 11:35am on 20/11/2022 for a conference in Uluru, the flight attendant Andrew had everyone laughing. This continued throughout the entire trip, which made it so much more enjoyable. If only all flights had an Andrew on them, I'd feel so much more comfortable flying. I would recommend Jetstar because of this experience.",0
HBA-SYD-HBA day trip to collect personal items. A big issue at SYD Airport with security. The check-in agent was more than helpful. She left her desk to see if I could get a spirit level through security. No. She escorted me back to her check in desk and we packed said item into checked luggage. The agent then added Fragile labels to my luggage. This service is more than anyone would ever expect from a LCC. The flight? Usual excellent in-flight service: politeness and efficiency.,0
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Great airline with easy booking, special services, e.g. wheel chair, friendly staff, and on time flights. They also have advantage of being cheapest at any given time and with Boeing comfortable and spacious leg room, you can't really complain.",0
"Horrible service from AirAsia. For the past 1 month, i've been trying to get a refund for my flight because of the pandemic. I've tried to reach out to them through their website, but i just keep getting redirected to their online chat bot AVA. Problem is AVA doesn't resolve anything, and it's buggy. I resorted to contacting them on Twitter, but that was not helpful at all as well. They would give you a reply, and proceed to not reply you for another week. It's always being picked up by another customer service agent, so they always ask the same few starting questions. Nothing gets resolved or moved on at all.",1
"Athens to Sydney via Singapore. Decent flights and seats but a few issues that left us all a bit disappointed. Their policy of charging over S$10/L for drinking water and refusing to provide any for free (even on an 11 hour flight) means their staff are constantly dealing with upset customers and are frequently grumpy as a result. As others have pointed out the call buttons are poorly places and set off constantly by people leaning on their armrests - the cabin staff mostly just ignore them. The menu was unimpressive, especially for an airline based out of SIN, and the hot meals (S$12) were tiny. The seat belt signs were on for more than half of our first two flights, with no turbulence, and with most passengers and the just ignoring them. On the whole feels even more budget than AirAsia / AirAsiaX or Jetstar, but a decent choice for the money if they're flying where you're going.",0
Sydney to Honolulu in business class on A330. Check in was quick and efficient although disappointed no priority baggage for business. We didn't take the upsell option with Qantas lounge access as gold Qantas FF so had access in any case. Product is closer to premium economy as is price and evaluation should consider this as noted many otter compare to full service airlines business products. The seat was ok comfortable but any overnight flight will always be hard. Perhaps better quality pillow and blankets would help. Food was good soy glazed chicken with noodles and vegetables. Chicken very tender and noodles more tasty than they looked. Vegetables were overlooked. Standout was cherry tomato and basil soup. What I liked was they took food and drink order before take off so getting drink after seatbelt sign off pretty quick. Crew very friendly especially cabin manager. Nice wine selection. Price difference between Jetstar and Qantas whose business product on 767 for route closer to domestic mean Jetstar very good option. IFE options poor bring own iPad.,0
A great experience! Everything was easy. Traveling with hand luggage we could use the boarding pass machines at check in. The boarding process went smooth. Inside the cabin we got good chairs with enough space for big and tall people. Free wifi during the flight was awesome. I can highly recommend ZIPAIR for your flight to Seoul!,0
"Flew from Melbourne to Singapore return with Scoot. Plane and flight were great, food is ok. Big disappointment is both my outbound and inbound flights got delayed by an hour due to operational requirements, whatever this means. It sounds like a paper work issue, which is disappointing as I assume this is in the airlines power and not caused by 3rd party or delayed inbound flight. Return was a 1.20am flight and there was no announcement of the delays till the flight was an 2 hours after boarding was meant to start. We were stuck in Singapore gate with 47 degree ""cold"" water to drink and no seats with 2 young kids, I would have happily stayed in the lounge I paid for.",0
"Melbourne to Singapore. On 11 Aug 2018, flight TR25 at 9.40 pm was cancelled after we checked in. Sad to say we had yet until today received SMS or email informing us about the cancelled flight. We were not even assigned our next flight home. Third party staffs in Melbourne dont handle the case professionally. We were left stranded for hours not knowing what is the next cause of actions. We were told hotel fully booked and they cant checked on the system on the status of our next flight home. When problems like this occur dont tell me SCOOT staffs are sleeping on this matter. Be considerate and think about those who need to work on 13 August. What choice do we have? No choice but to book our next flight home on our own expenses at about RM9000. Is not a small sum for 4 pax. If SCOOT had taken the trouble to offer us the next flight home, do we need to do this? Our actual cost paid for our flight from Launceston to Singapore via Melbourne is about rm4500 for 4 pax, supposed to be low cost. But now we ended paying about rm9000 due to no fault of ours. Imagine the ordeal of waiting. To wait for the next flight(no updated info) and Calls centre were totally useless. I would like Scoot team to handle the case more professionally .",1
Yes you may save money on the airfare but it is so not worth the saving to suffer through one of their flights in my opinion. If you get a basic ticket no food or drink apart from a small bottle of water is provided and it was freezing cold in the cabin and cost something like $20 to use a blanket for the trip. Never again will I fly Jetstar I have sworn except if it is to Phuket which at the moment seems to be the only airline that goes there directly from Sydney. You get what you pay for with Jetstar! I flew Sydney to Bangkok return.,1
"Ho Chi Min City to Melbourne via Singapore. We were recommended Scoot by our travel agent (former Travel Agent). Scoot does not have an economy class it's more of a cattle class. There was nothing budget about the cost of the tickets and we were prepared for not having a meal on board but could not believe that not even water was provided. First, we were told that we had to pay for it in Singapore dollars, they then relented and said we could use a credit card ($10 min. purchase). The service on board was disgraceful. Before leaving Melbourne I spent a day arranging additional luggage at a cost of $220 and after numerous phone calls they still could not be bothered to send me confirmation - it was left to me to explain it at the airport. Automatic check-in did not work as it kept telling me that information on passport did tot match E-tickets - more drama as consequently we could not print out our luggage tags. All four flights on our trip ended up running late. It seems that punctuality is not one of their virtues (they don't have any). I have no intention of ever flying with them again and will do everything in my power to dissuade all my acquaintance to do the same",1
"Flew Singapore to Ho Chi Minh. Would never recommend Jetstar to another person. It's not good when you loathe an airline before you even board the flight. When the check out page says $xx, you hit confirm, and then you get a receipt saying you were just charged $xx+$20 with no explanation, it shows the company has no values and keeps fees hidden until you cannot back out. Many other airlines out there, I recommend always choosing another.",1
Flew Bangkok-Manila and return. This was my first flight with this airline and I was very impressed. Flight attendants were efficient and pleasant. I would most definitely use them again.,0
"Dropped my daughter at airport at 8.30, they cancelled the flight twice, then having my 17 year old daughter sitting at the airport till 12.30pm  and cancelled flight until the next morning is a joke. Very safe, good one Jetstar.",1
"Kansai to Ho Chi Minh City via KL. Very bad experience with luggage. They wanted to charge me $US 520 for one luggage of 23kg for an air fare of $US148. After arguing with them, brought the weight down to 19kg and coat $330. Will never fly Air Asia again",1
9th Nov Hong Kong- Manila and Manila- Busuanga (cancelled). 15th Nov - Tagbilaran - Manila and Manila - Caticlan (diverted to Kalibo). During the last few weeks we have made 4 trips on Cebu Pacific and each one has been a challenge. 3 flights were delayed and 1 cancelled completely. Of the 3 which were delayed one to Caticlan was so late they ended up diverting to Kalibo as the airport was closed. As soon as anything goes wrong they are useless. I made 2 calls to them and spent over 2.5 hours trying to resolve problems and all you do is go round in circles. When you ask to speak to a manager they tell you there isn't one. If you insist eventually one appears. Their managers aren't any better though so there really is very little point. If they promise to email you don't believe them. They're unlikely to bother. Don't expect to be informed if you're flight is cancelled if you haven't got a local number. All in all if things go smoothly you may be ok. Once they start to go wrong you're in trouble. If you want some degree of certainty you may be better sticking with PAL!,1
"Flew on JQ409 from the Gold Coast to Sydney this morning. Upon arrival at Gold Coast airport, we checked in using the kiosks  a process which was smooth and simple as both the check-in kiosk and the automated bag drop system were very easy to use. Boarding started around 7 minutes late but (because of the efficiency of the process) we departed right on schedule. The flight itself was rather uneventful, taking around an hour to get to Sydney. The seat was comfortable, though the legroom was quite cosy. All food and drink on board had to be purchased. The landing in Sydney was smooth, and disembarking was as smooth as boarding. Overall, I would definitely consider flying with JetStar again in future as the flight experience overall was very good (particularly for a budget airline).",0
I wish I had seen the reviews on this awful company. I have booked a flight to fly from Perth to Singapore this August with a connecting flight to UK a couple of hours later. Scoot decided to cancel the original flight completely. They offered me a later flight but I told them it would not be any good as I would arrive in Singapore after my connecting flight back to UK. Customer service was absolutely no help. They would not give a refund or an earlier flight. Please be very cautious when booking with Scoot. They make the rules purely for their own gain. I will never use these again.,1
I booked my vacation tickets for my family from Abu Dhabi to Calicut unfortunately due to Covid-19 I cancelled my traveling but did not get a full refund. It was disappointed that l lost 75% of my cash. It was refundable ticket but I don't know why they are utilizing this situation. It's not acceptable. It's very poor service.,1
"Scoot lost our bag on the flight from Sydney to Berlin with a change in Singapore. When we landed in Berlin, our bag didn't reach the final destination. We reported to ""Lost and Found"" of Tegel Airport immediately. It's been 4 days and they still can't identify location of our bag. For your information: it's 19 kg big bag - did it just simply disappear? I've read a lot of similar stories of people who lost their luggage on Scoot flights. It raises a lot of questions towards this carrier.",1
"So, I tried to heed the many warnings that I saw in this airline's terrible reviews regarding their baggage Scam policy. I recently had a flight from Mumbai to Maldives, for which the ticket fare was $159 for a one-way ticket. Still a little pricey, but not bad. The only reason why I took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the Maldives. After booking the ticket, I noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED. BEWARE!",1
"Cairns to Osaka. Jetstar was one of the worst airlines I've ever used and I have travelled more than 20 different countries. I booked the ticket thru a travelling company, but I got a cancellation message from Jetstar 4 hours before the flight. I had to contact to the travelling company and had to reschedule the whole journey by myself. Jetstar said they will reimburse every extra expenses that I had to spent due to the cancellation but I've never got any replies from them after a month long waiting. I liked their cheap price but the inconvenience that I unfortunately went thru was good enough reason for me not to use them again.",1
"Worst airline experience ever, due to terrible service. The staff is very desorganized and doesn't want to help the customers. They kept changing gates on multiple airports, and constantly giving wrong information to all the guests. Basically each staff would tell you a different information about the flight, like telling you the flight is delayed 1 hour, asking you to seat down at the gate waiting for information, and suddenly you realize your flight is already boarding on another gate and is actually not delayed. Also during boarding they are messy and create problems out of nowhere, for example while checking the boarding pass before boarding they tell me my name is incorrect and I need to go and change it ASAP, but actually no, they just don't really know how to read, and all of them look a bit oblivious of what's going on at all times.",1
"Sydney to Phuket via Singapore. We took 4 flights (2 each way) and all flights were late to take off, ranging from 30 min to 1hr 55 min. hile waiting almost 2 hours for the first flight from Sydney the staff looked to be very stressed and there seemed to be little effective organisation. Once we took off the flight was uneventful and the staff were friendly and efficient. The Boeing 787 was a new plane with good legroom for economy. I did not eat any food so can't comment. The next flight (also late) was an A 320, much older and more uncomfortable.Two more delayed flights in the reverse on the way back. 10kg of carry one luggage was a good amount. It was weighed at each stop so don't think you can go over the limit without penalty. We arrived at the stated gate on our boarding pass gate 82 and found a staff member who had been sent there to redirect passengers to gate 15. I couldn't help but think that this is a very risky way to advise passengers and how easy it would be to miss your flight if that person did not find you! The next and huge problem was that the arrival time printed on our e ticket and announced by the captain was incorrect by 1 hour. Daylight saving had commenced the week before.Therefore our arranged pickup as per our ticket arrival time was 1 hour earlier. I messaged the company from the tarmac as we were arriving in the hope that they were able to wait and luckily they had gone to the other terminal and then returned. We drove away and then had to return again for another family who also had been given the incorrect arrival time. I have no confidence in the organisational power of this airline. The captain was following the incorrect information he had. I would not recommend as 4/4 late flights caused us a lot of angst and we could have missed the connecting flights had they not been hours apart.It was also the middle of the night with no where to rest with children.",1
"The seats were fine. pretty comfortable, not any more uncomfortable than other budget airlines, in fact more comfortable than many budget airlines. The main problem is they are too strict about carryon bag weight, it has to be less than 7kg. Everyone was slow to check in because their carry on bag was ""too heavy"" and they had to stuff more things in their checked bag (i had to as well). The person working there was nice enough to eventually give up and let me just take a normal amount of carryon with me instead of continuing to try and get it down to 7 pounds. the workers at narita airport check in seemed earnest and happy. There's a limited amount of movies and the internet is slow/non-functional during times when everyone is awake on the plane.",0
"My issues started before we even flew. I recovered from Covid but was still testing positive for over a week. Had to get a letter from the Japanese Consulate. At first Zipair said they don't know if they can accept it and to email a copy in. So I emailed a copy and was told they won't accept it. So I called overseas to their Japan HQ and the people there said ""They might accept it at LAX, try your luck"". No I am not going to try my luck. 12 hours before before my flight was to leave they send me an email saying they can accept the consulate paper. Ridiculous that they are so disorganized. Check-in was easy but their online support said they will add TSA precheck when we check-in. At check-in they refused to do so. On the flight you are only given 1 meal, if you paid in advance and 1 bottle of water - it's barely a snack even to Japanese. You are also given the food 1 hour after boarding so enjoy 10 hours of nothing. You will get no more food, water, etc. If you want anything else you have to order it via your phone connected to their in-flight wifi. I ordered a coffee, cost about $2.50 and was brought in a very small cup.  At least when you order snacks they do come fast. In-flight entertainment didn't exist. The system worked on the ground but the second it was airborne all entertainment didn't work. So bring your own movies and entertainment. The seats were clear and nice. Felt the same as any other airline but it certainly was cleaner. The $300 savings was absolutely not worth it. This is Spirit airlines Japan Edition",1
"Guangzhou to Singapore. Flight was very full with uncooperative passengers. Situation was slightly chaotic and I had 3 young kids (under 7 years old) travelling with me. A steward was very professional, genuine and lovely with repeating his instructions to passengers, speaking to my children and interacting with his colleagues. A not so pleasant flight that was made better with him on board.",0
Recently traveled Brisbane-Bali on the new Dreamliner in Business Class. Overall was a great experience and would highly recommend. It is the same style seat as domestic business class which was fine for a 6 hr flight. Meals Drinks and Entertainment all included all for a low fare of $1500 for 2 people return so this cannot be compared to a full service airline like many people do. Friendly Staff and modern entertainment. Highly recommend if you can get a great price like we did.,0
"Flew Scoot from Bangkok Don Mueang to Singapore on a new Boeing 787. Upgraded on the bid app online to business class for only 30. Boarding was very quick and organised and the flight pushed back ahead of schedule. Seat was very comfortable and offered good pitch. Crews very friendly and also lots of information from the flight crew as well. Food was not good but for 70 total price for a 2.5 hour flight in business class it was an absolute steal, so I can't complain. Will be flying this route a lot in the next few months and will be using Scoot instead of Air Asia or Jetstar.",0
"DXB-MNL MNL-DXB - as what the brand suggests ""Budget Airline"" so don't expect a five star service. Nevertheless the cabin is clean staff are friendly food are good (Chicken Adobo and Beef Caldereta).",0
Melbourne to Brisbane. I paid for 20kg checked luggage. I only used 9kg. 11kg under weight. My carry on bag was about 1kg over the allowed 7kg (the work Laptop does it every time!) Jetstar charged me an extra $60 for the privilege of carring kgs I has already paid for. I fly fortnightly. Frequently with Jetstar. I won't be flying with them again.,1
Worst lost luggage service you can expect. The airline only delivered my luggage halfway and I had to travel for one week without a baby stroller let alone spare clothes. I understand these things can happen but I do not expect it to take more than 1 month to get the luggage delivered to my home address. It took the airline 3 weeks to locate whereabouts of my luggage and now its saying I need to organize with the airport to get the bags sent to my home address which is located in another city. What is even worse is their customer support. You cannot be put through to the case manager only they can reach you but they never managed to dial my number correctly. When you call customer support minimum wait time is 30mins and they cannot provide any solutions as they are not authorized. All in all will never fly with Jetstar again.,1
"Low cost airline (or more like mid-cost in a post-COVID world) so expectations should be set accordingly but gets you from A to B. Mid-age aircraft, narrow seats and pitch, basic food available for purchase, and minimal service. Premium Flex is a waste of money as no check-in or boarding line-up or luggage priority as promised. Ticket changes or cancellation are painful.",1
"Osaka to Manila. Your typical budget airline. They don't really care about being nice to their passengers.  I was in the airport gate waiting area at Kansai Airport. There was a lot of vacant seats and I decided to seat up in front. I was already one seat apart from another person, who happened to be the First Officer. He asked me if I could move to another seat since the Captain was sitting there next to him and I should sit one seat apart away from him. I moved one seat next to the one I was sitting to, but I felt insulted.  Don't they have their own lounge?  Well, I think I got what I paid for, despite paying extra prepaid charges for the baggage and in-flight meals. I could have taken Philippine Airlines if this was the case. On the bright side, at least the flights were on time. It gets you from point A to B safely and my checked-in baggage was handled without any problems.",0
"Launceston to Sydney. This flight was on time and uneventful. Boarding was orderly and the crew were helpful and hard-working. I have no issue with the seats and leg room that Jetstar offer. The cabin was clean, the value-for-money was excellent, and the flight times on offer for this route suited me very well. A good flight that, in my experience, is typical of Jetstar domestic.",0
SYD-NAN. We were delayed 1 hour. The actual flight itself was reasonable but until someone's bottle of water dripped on my husband and other fellow passengers from the overhead compartment. Cabin crew cleaned up the water and were friendly. The new iPads for inflight entertainment was great. It is great to keep the kids entertained during the flight. Food was nice and the seats were also comfortable. Overall a good flight with Jetstar.,0
"Boarding and refund process is horrific. Been rerouted to serval ports rather than directly flying to the domestic airport destination which cost time and livid waiting at the gate for boarding. The second flight they have cancelled and rebooked the flight unlimited times like its a game and when you decide to just refund the money, the experience is worse. Refund your money to a closed account and they're claiming it was already credited but can provide the transaction number to help the bank recover the wire transfer.",1
"I have flown with many different airlines around the world for over 35 years. I have flown with Jetstar on occasions and every time it has resulted in late departure, cancelled flights, poor inflight service and the worst customer service I have ever experienced with any business. It's not all about profit Jetstar. Get you act together.",1
"Ho Chi Minh City to Male via Singapore. After reading everyones comments I thought I would share my negative experience. We arrived at the airport to check in to fly to the Maldives only to be informed that our flight had been changed and left earlier that morning and no one bothered to contact us! I was told by the people at the airport I had to call the help desk. I rang the helpdesk and had a very rude staff member who told me there was nothing he could do as there were no other flights to the Maldives. He offered me a refund in vouchers for the company. I told him I did not want a refund in vouchers if he couldnt get me a flight and I wanted a full refund to my account. He said he would put me on hold and transfer me to the correct person to talk to. He then hung up on me. I tried to call again but couldnt get through, have sent them an email and still waiting. Due to them not informing us about our flight change we had to book new flights which were over $1000 nz dollars, we had to stay two nights in Singapore so more money spent on accommodation, not to mention the money we had already spent on accommodation for the Maldives. This one inconsiderate act costed us a lot of money. Would never recommend this airline to anyone even if it was the only flight.",1
The team of Indigo is very professional and polite from Wheelchair to checkin. Special thanks to Miss Manisha Kaim for such a super fast check in. Indigo should proud to have team members like her.,0
Have flown with Scoot several times and the planes have been on time and arrived early in some occasions all smooth with check in and bag collection as good as any airline I've used for this. Scoot Biz are much better than any standard seat with other airlines. Food is a bit basic but for the same price as the cheapest fare in economy with 38 inch legroom it's with it. The entertainment does not seem to work on my own devices which is probably the only downside. Overall a good service and will keep using if the price is right.,0
Very frustrating experience. Does not allow connecting flights at Tokyo during the time of COVID restrictions and does not inform this when making the reservation online. This is not clearly stated and feels very deceptive. Do not fly this airline and pay for something reputable.,1
"Phuket to Sydney via Singapore. I had relatively low expectations when I booked being that Scoot is a budget carrier. However I was very impressed overall. Giving an 8/10 based on comfort and relativity of price. On the Sydney to Singapore return legs, very new Boeing 787. Seats were comfortable enough (and I'm 6 feet tall). Service was efficient and cabin crew were polite. On the legs Singapore to Phuket we flew ex tiger A320 aircraft. Fairly new. Interior a little bit tired but seats were comfortable. No in-flight entertainment, but I just used my iPad and downloaded a few movies on Netflix. We experienced a delay on our return leg from Phuket to Singapore, which we thought may cause issues with our connecting flight. However staff managed the issue well and gave us updated and information where to go on arrival at Singapore. And last of all, if you have to have a stopover, why not make it at Changi airport. It's rated best in the world. Free cinemas, pool, butterfly garden. Lots to keep you entertained. Would definitely fly with Scoot again",0
"Vientiane to Singapore via Bangkok. In Vientiane the check-in counter asked for $200 USD for 2 bags. That is airport/airline robbery. They said it was because we had booked a transfer but we booked from Vientiane to Singapore, they had the stopover in Bangkok included in the booking. I have flown hundreds of time on dozens of different airlines and never been charged for a transfer when the booking is with one airline through their website. Also the price is gross and disrespectful to their customers. My partner and I shuffled items around to fit into one checked bag, however, the whole process was horrible, ridiculous, and not customer friendly. I can't believe we had to pay $100 for one bag for one booking. I am very upset and irritated, I will never book with them again.",1
"We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again.",1
OOL-MEL. Was met at the airport by the grumpiest check-in staff member. Aircraft clean and seated in a row of 3 with 2 spare seats. Crew were very good but just going through the motions. Flight departed on time and landed about 5 mins early. Uneventful flight and would use them again but prefer Virgin.,0
"Scoot Biz Singapore to Bali Check in and boarding all very seamless Left a little late, however, arrived on time. Seat ( 1k) good with plenty of leg room. Food and beverage included and ok for low cost Cabin. Curtains/floor etc could have been cleaner, especially for a 6 year old aircraft. Cabin crew ok with good announcements from flight deck. Overall reasonable value for money. Would fly with them again if the price is right!",0
"Flew Jetstar Airways from Cairns to Adelaide. Seat 1A - definitely worth the few extra $s for the legroom as (like most economy classes these days, including Virgin Australia and Qantas) passengers squeezed in like sardines, especially those in middle seats. Couldn't fault the flight, despite a 20 minute delay due to having to offload luggage in Adelaide belonging to a no-show passenger. Thanks to a strong tail wind, flight took only 2hrs 40 mins. Flight attendants were friendly and professional, and the female co-pilot and her captain brought the aircraft in for the smoothest landing I've experienced. Is it because I was in an exit seat that I was referred to by my first name whenever the flight attendant spoke to me? Closest thing to feeling like a business class passenger on a budget airline. Have flown Jetstar on four occasions now, and have never had a problem.",0
"They cancelled my flight JQ28 on the 5th of April from Phuket to Sydney (apparently the 3rd flight in 3 days) then kept us at the airport for almost 4 hours without food or drink whilst we had to wait for hotels to be arranged. Then they lied as we were told the hotel was close to the airport when in fact it was 25km away as I noticed when we were on the bus the driver drove past the area where they told us the hotel was so I asked him where he was going to which he replied ""Phuket town"". If I knew that before I could have gone to my home in Phuket instead and save myself a lot of time. But because they said it was close to the airport I figured there was no point going home. We got there around 3am and aircons blew hot air then got told we would be picked up at 1pm to go to the airport even know the hotel manager stated a late check out was totally fine. We got to the airport before 2pm and check in didn't open until 0340pm and i got told by check in staff the flight might be cancelled again as there were not enough first aid supplies on board and they needed to be flown in. At check in we got a 300baht voucher which was only valid at burger king where meals start around 500baht. The flight got further delayed because aircraft was not ready yet. So I missed a whole day of precious family time whom I hadn't seen for 7.5 years plus spent a lot of money on overpriced airport priced food and drinks. The crew was nice put the plane was dirty as hell. Dust everywhere, drink marks etc. When we landed in Sydney they parked us on a remote stand near cargo and we couldn't disembark because the AFP had to come onboard. After that there were no busses available as Qantas parked an A380 on the bay next to us and those passenger had to be disembarked by bus too. Once through customs I went hunting for Jetstar Australia customer service. A very rude agent told me to go to the office on the 3rd floor, when I got there in was closed and dark. I went back down and asked her why she sent me to a closed office. Then some ladies with Jetstar uniforms where there but apparently they worked for Swissport. The supervisor seemed very cold and had lack of empathy and tried to brush me off and was very condescending. She told me to go online and contact Jetstar or call the call center but then said call center might be a waste of time (really?) I am not gonna let this go. I will be pushing for compensation! They need to pay for their mistakes.",1
"Cairns to Sydney. I booked a roundtrip flight from Sydney to Cairns through Expedia and found a lot of options. The cheapest was one way on Virgin Australia and the return flight was on Jetstar. I read the reviews but was seduced by the price. Check in was fine. Paid extra for the checked luggage, fine. Got to the airport 2 hours before departure and just as I arrive, I get a text that my flight has been cancelled and I've been rebooked for the morning! What?! Who does that 2 hours before departure?! I ran to the Virgin Australia counter and managed to get on a flight back to Sydney at twice the price. Jetstar refunded my ticket (or at least they say they have) but wouldn't pay for the difference in price of the ticket I had to buy so I could leave. They had offered to reimburse up to $150 for a hotel, but wouldn't give me that money to use towards the new air ticket I had to buy due to their cancelation! So now I'm out about $130 USD. Should've booked RT on Virgin. Or anyone but Jetstar. Never again. Don't think it won't happen to you, it happened to me.",1
"Singapore to Ipoh. Flew Scoot simply because of timing and no major full service airlines served this route. The plane was old, but they flew on time, the return flight was earlier. As this is a budget airline, I didnt expect much. Food and drinks are only available at a price and the seat pitch was as how budget airlines usually go. What was most troublesome was the passengers. The moment the seatbelt light was off, the pushing and shoving begins. Everyone tried to get hold of their luggage. This seemingly old gentle man stepped on my foot twice, pushed and shoved me and others to get to his suitcase two rows away. When he was done I faced him and told him you dont need to push and shove you know, you could just ask and he pretended he didnt understand English. If you can, just check in your luggage. The passengers always bring a lot of carry on and the odds of finding a space above your seat is slim.",0
"Brisbane to Athens via Singapore. Inexperience flight crew from Singapore to Athens, poor customer service. We experienced several huge turbulence, the worst turbulence I've had. The pilot kept telling us to sit properly and buckle up without further explanation. I traveled with my cousin but we can't check in online so we arrived at the counter before check in open and specifically asked to have seats together, the staff was assure that we'll be seated together but it turned out to be the seats were separated! After I asked to get a fragile sticker to be stick on my luggage, my cousin then asked for one on hers, the staff rolled her eyes in front of us showing her annoyance.  Overall, very disappointed first experience with Scoot and will never fly with them again.",1
Flew from Surat Thani to Bangkok Don Mueang for business. Booked for luggage and thus had a hot seat and also a meal. The service was standard Air sia and standard budget airlines. The staff members were polite as how usually budget airlines goes. Seat pitch at my seat (1D) was pretty OK. However I still cannot imagine taking budget airlines for long haul flights.,0
Flew Gold Coast-Osaka and Tokyo (Narita)-Gold Coast. Excellent value $600 RT each including seat assignments meals iPad rental baggage and QF miles. Seats 54AB OOL-KIX 53AB NRT-OOL. First trip on JQ economy seat pitch is excellent on the A330! More comfortable than a lot of full service carriers. Cabin Crew attentive but not overly intrusive. Chatty FA on OOL-KIX gave us lots of tips for our first trip to Osaka/Kyoto. iPad rental a bit disappointing as content not very extensive. Meals very basic but were included in a prepaid bundle. The 2-4-2 configuration on the A330 is good for couples travelling. Paid $10 for entry to the Gold Coast lounge very basic (soon to be taken over by QF). Used QF lounge in NRT as a QF Gold cardholder good but very busy. Overall a fantastic trip especially bearing in mind QF or JL SYD-NRT were over $1200 per person. Would definitely fly Jetstar long haul again as long as there is a substantial savings and the flight is on the A330.,0
"Ubon Ratchathani airport to Don Mueang airport in Bangkok. The check in was simple the front desk personally was great and efficient. The security check point at airport was no hassle and simple. Overall my check in was fantastic. Cabin crew was quick and efficient with getting everyone ready and quick with serving all the meals. The only but I have about this flight or airlines was they have so many rules.  Specially seems like lot of rules now that they announced them in 3 languages, Thai, English, Mandarin Chinese.",0
Melbourne to Hobart and return both legs on an A321. The dungeon-like departure area in Melbourne is a poor start to the journey. The plane to Hobart departed and arrived 15 mins late. On board service in both directions was friendly and efficient but the seat pitch was tight. I paid a very cheap fare and the flights represented very good value.,0
Flew AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to Manila. The check process at KLIA2 is crazy even if you arrive 2 hours early it's not possible to check into your flight without it being stressful. They require all sorts of crazy info. Automated check in doesn't work. Ended up making it with 5 minutes to spare. I'd arrived at the airport 3 hours earlier. If I'd missed it I guarantee no refund.,1
Perth to Bali. I spent so much time on Jetstar website for finding how to add a surfboard. After a while I decided to call them but no one was able to do so. After all I started an online chat for adding the surfboard and finally we payed $50 for it. Once we arrived at the airport Ive been told that the Kg for the surfboard werent in the package so they charged me other $100. Then I had tho pay other $50 for flight back so in total I paid $200 for a surfboard.,1
Flew to Singapore with our 3 kids the flight over was quite pleasant we paid extra for yellow seats with more room which made a lot of difference. The business class seats were available for a $100 upgrade which came with free lease of ipads. Stewardesses were very polite although a little difficult to understand. Meals were pretty good. Flight home was late at night - a little cramped with 2 adults and 3 kids on 4 seats while everyone else had 3 seats to themselves to spread out and sleep. A lot of people whinge about this kind of airline but you get what you pay for! We got value for money and would not hesitate to fly with them again!,0
Low cost flight low cost quality. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Then from Melbourne to Singapore in April 2014. The second flight was cancelled at the last minute so obliged to take midnight flight. Hours standing in a queue to check in luggage. Seats narrow and uncomfortable. No entertainment. Food and drink expensive with little choice.,1
"Singapore to Hong Kong. Scoot is a decent airline for the ticket price that I paid. Online check-in was simple to use although I have no idea why there is a need for a further document check at the airport when I was eligible for straight-to-gate. Boarding was orderly and the flight departed Singapore on time. My assigned seat was comfortable and legroom was good. Cabin crew were also generally good although they didn't really smile very often and they generally left passengers alone. Unlike AirAsia Scoot charges for inflight WiFi streaming entertainment and I thought that was not worth it. The onboard menu wasn't so impressive and food was generally expensive. The flight arrived in Hong Kong early so that's a plus point in my book. I was not really happy with the placement of the attendant call buttons on the armrest - during the entire flight I could hear many instances of passengers accidentally pressing the buttons (myself included). All in all I'd be happy to give Scoot another try again, but until they fix that annoying call button and provide free inflight entertainment I would not look to them for long-haul flights.",0
Absolutely appalling customer service. My flight was cancelled and I was told I would get a refund. Literally years later my case was closed with no explanation. Finally got hold a human through live chat to be told my refund has been rejected. Again no explanation.,1
"A LCC so have your expectations low but certainly this LCC is better than many full fledged carriers. On time performance is their main USP, best in India so was my flight, departed and arrived on time. Aircraft was clean and fresh, staff were courteous, seats are ok for 1-2 hr flight. Snacks and beverages on payment or pre-booking.",0
Mumbai - Thiruvananthapuram 25 Dec 2014 Flight SG215. A very good option for domestic flights in India. All flights we took were on-time. Efficient check-in at airports. Seats weren't that comfortable but for short haul flights you can't complain.,0
"I want to share my worst nightmare experience with JetStar. It was on Sunday 15/08/2021. I And one of my friends were traveling from Wellington - Christchurch - Wellington (Flight number JQ290). I would suggest it's better to go with Air New Zealand or any other airplane company instead of Jetstar. Service desk assistance was the worst part of this experience. She doesn't know who to deal with. She behaved very rudely and even didn't try to help us. She thought that she is some kind of owner of this company and can do whatever she wants. First, they took money for transfer fees and then refused to refund that. When I called their complaint department, they denied it as well. I felt that I got framed. I was so shocked and depressed by their behaviors. I will never ever fly with this airline and would suggest the same for everyone.",1
"They have a very strict carry on weight policy of 7KG. I was forced to put 5000 worth of lenses into checked luggage. No option to pay extra, wouldn't allow me to book an extra seat to double my luggage rate. I'm praying to god they are ok when I land. Staff on the desk didn't seem to grasp why this was such a huge issue or why a photogragher might easily carry more than 7KG in hand luggage.",1
"Rescheduled my flight at short notice. Sent an email saying the flight was rescheduled. Had a Flight Rescheduled Refund policy, refused to refund the flight because according to them 'the flight was not rescheduled on their end'.",1
It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. Everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. Your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft. Go for that little extra spending and choose a renowned airline.,1
Hong Kong to Singapore. Scoot refuses to refund me my money after rescheduling my flight by more than 8 hours. I've called multiple times but have been put on hold and eventually not getting a reply. Feels like I've been made a fool. I have also emailed many times and not get a reply. What is happening? Is this a strategy to prevent losses?  How can we get a response and a refund?,1
Booked a return flight from BKK to SG. Pre-selected window seat in the red seating of the aircraft. The seats were very thin - ok for a short haul 2 hour flight. The person in front reclined their seat which literally meant I had a headrest in my face. Flight departed on time which was a relief after seeing other reviews. Cabin attendants were far from 'fun vibrant' crew members mentioned in all the airline PR. More like exhausted/frustrated with their job. One snapped at a women when she asked to clarify the pre-ordered sandwich she had just been given. All in all an ok flight. Decided to upgrade to Biz scootz for the return leg just. Very easy to upgrade in SG - 99 SD plus 20SD administration fee. Seats on aircraft cannot and should never be compared to a normal business class product on every other airline. Meal was good. Flight was on time.,1
"Flew Scoot from Nanjing to Singapore. It is important that anyone planning to fly with Scoot, has to take note that you don't need to purchase premium seats because they can be changed without your knowledge. Assigned other premium seat as a result. Scoot uses its Condition of Carriage as an agreement that they can change your seat without prior notice. If you want premium seat, you can always do an upgrade onboard the aircraft. There have been many cases against Scoot and majority lost their fight, therefore their Condition of Carriage can be use as a mean to exploit customer expectation.",1
"Athens to Singapore. Be very careful of what you pay them. I paid extra EUR90 to upgrade the seat. Days later, I accidentally downgraded my seat to a EUR20 one. I wanted to change my seat back. So I called. I was told that the difference of EUR70 is not refundable and I need to pay another EUR90 to get my original seat back, because it's their policy. What a ""nice"" policy to make sure that they keep everything that's in their pocket even if it doesn't belong to them. The first time flying with them, also the last.",1
Auckland to Christchurch. Baggage check in was closed early on a flight that was delayed. Was standing in line for 20 mins watching 5 staff behind the counter mess around doing nothing then telling me I was too late to check in when I finally was able to talk to someone. They claimed I was late to check in and that I should have been earlier however I wasnt the only one in the queue with this issue. About 3 others were also waiting to check in their baggage to the same flight but staff were not serving people and when they finally did we were blamed as being late when we had been standing in the queue since well before check in was due to close. I was rather frustrated when getting to the counter to find out I would have to wait for another 2 hours on arrival at my destination as my bags couldnt make it and would be sent on the next flight. I said I was disappointed in the service and would reconsider flying with Jetstar in the future. A Jetstar staff member proceeded to snap back at me claiming she didnt care whether I flew with Jetstar again or not and that it was my fault I wasnt here early enough. I work in retail myself for a company that was recently awarded best retailer for customer service in Australia. Jetstar staff definitely have a thing or two to learn. The experience I had with Jetstar on this incident was appalling. I fly every month for business however I will no longer choose Jetstar and will encourage others not to either. I have experienced bad customer service from Jetstar in the past but never this bad. The way I was spoken to was disgusting and extremely rude. Never again.,1
"I had flights from Manila to Bangkok and when travel bans for COVID-19 were release. I decided to call them and get a refund as per their policy, I was informed that my flight was cancelled by someone without my knowledge and the remaining fund were put into a ""Travel Fund"" (which was less than half of what I paid them and I will never use). Worst of all they can't even guarantee that this person will not be able to make a flight booking with the remainder of the travel fund thereby stealing my cash, honestly don't think their call centre agents even understand what the issue was here, it's very said that their business is run in such an unethical way, I didn't even get a chance to fly with them. Safe travels.",1
Sydney to the Sunshine Coast and back last week. Couldn't fault anything on either trip. Flights left on time cabin crew friendly and professional aircraft clean. Although won't be back in Australia for some time would recommend them.,0
"The customer service is horrible. Any mistakes you make during booking, they wont able to change and require cancellation of booking. When that happen, they only partially refund your money. If you dont check-in within 1 hour of departure at the counter you wont able to fly.  The plane are small and they charge you on every single things including a plastic cup. And they picky about your carry-on weight. Overall, you think you save money by going cheap then its actually the opposite. You will spend a lot more money if you are late to the check-in. Or if you mess up the flight date. This is based on my experienced. Because those events above mention did happen to me. I was 5 mins late to check-in even when the plane departure is in 1 hour. They wouldn't check-in us in.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. It was a flight delayed about one hour. The flight was comfortable and I slept a little. Did not purchase anything as I was not hungry. We arrived in Bali around 1:30am one hour late.,0
Flight to Sydney 2nd May 4 hrs late leaving. Not advised at check in and travelers advised in the departure lounge 30 mins before flight departed. Offer of an $8 refreshment voucher. Cheapest sandwich in the airport costs more! Advised by staff to use it at the donut stand. No empathy from ground staff made it worse the uncaring person at the desk was a manager. The next scheduled to Sydney left on time leaving customers whose earlier flight was cancelled still waiting. A little bit of empathy goes a long way and it was certainly not forthcoming from Jetstar staff. Flew back Qantas today what a pleasure. Will never fly Jetstar again.,1
"Jetstar was actually above what I expected flying from Melbourne to Townsville, but it started a little rough. We had driven for 1 hour in an uber to get to the airport and we had about five suitcases - on the check-in iPad, we had to check in each one of us individually which wasn't a big help. However, the experience got better once we boarded. The cabin crew were friendly and the plane was pretty clean, but the legroom was shocking. My knees were literally touching the seat in front! The Jetstar menu was good, with a decent range of food although a bit pricey. Toilets were spotless, surprisingly and the magazine was great. overall, Jetstar is a cheap and decent way to travel and I would love to return some day.",0
I flew from Singapore to Jakarta on May 14th and opted for the Red Carpet Service paying S$55 for the extra service. I thought check in was efficient but it turns out I should have been given lounge access but this didn't happen so I bought breakfast. I guess the priority boarding was good but I'd had to pay extra for my seat allocation as well. The flight was good with friendly and helpful crew and regular updates from the flight deck. I'm flying back to Singapore on May 22nd from Jakarta and look forward to a good flight in seat 1A.,0
"Booked flight Perth to Singapore take off time 12.10 am ""ten past midnight."" Flight was delayed because of bad weather until 1pm ""one o clock in the afternoon."" We had booked this flight so that we could allow for up to 8-9 hours delay because we know that they are famous for not taking off on time. We had to catch a cruise so the 13 plus hour delay which we ended up with would make us to late for the ship. We were told by Jetstar staff there would be no refund and the only thing we could do was to try and get seats on Singapore Airlines which after lots of running around the airport we were able to locate Singapore Airlines office and managed to get the last 2 seats at a cost of over $1000. We then proceeded to fly the same route that Jetstar could not fly because of bad weather. Tiger Airways also took off on time Jetstar being the only Airline grounded because of bad weather. If we had allowed ourselves more time and booked the same flight 24 hours earlier we would still have had to wait until 13-00 hrs because the flight the night before had also been ""delayed"".",1
"Sydney to Honolulu on 10th May. I just wanted to write this review today to thank the absolutely amazing crew. Staff were exemplary in there professionalism, courteous, attentive and super friendly.  Wish all of my flights were like this. Thanks Jetstar!",0
"Bangkok to Denpasar. Uneventful but fairly comfortable fligh . As much as such a flight can be comfortable. It helps when a flight is half full as ours was. Professional crew and as expected they will do anything to promote what ever they sell. If crew on regular airline would make water runs half as often as i have had the drinks sales trolley pass on airasia flight this would make flying more comfortable. On the flight to Denpasar we had what seems to be a new A320 from AirAsia indonesia , return flight on a very tired A320 from AirAsia Thailand. Enjoyed my flights, will surely use them again.",0
"Kolkata to Bengaluru by Indigo. Check-in for the flight was smoothly done via the kiosks as well as the baggage security screening. The staff at the counter had informed in advance that the flight was going to be delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming flight which was good however on the notification screens it was still displayed that the flight was on time and this was only updated when the boarding was around the corner. The flight was delayed by an hour. So that meant instead of reaching the destination at 2310 hours, the arrival was at 2350 hours which was kind of late. At the boarding gate, there was an irate passenger who was taking his frustration out on the staff but the staff handled the situation extremely well. The boarding process was hurried as the crew tried to compensate for the delay which was much appreciated. The rest of the flight was pretty uneventful. However during de-boarding, the crew were polite and wished goodbye to me but not to everyone probably due to the fact that the crew were not expecting the rest of the passengers to thank them. Baggage was also retrieved in a safe condition. As a paying customer, I am content with their services and even though things like delays can happen in a congested area like India, they get the job done.",0
"Among the worse airline in all respects. Terrible website, non-existent customer service, indifferent staff, horrible oily food and constant delays on most domestic and regional flights. And it has been getting worse with each passing year. Hardly remember a domestic flight in Malaysia which departed or reached on time.",1
JQ3 SYD-HNL. First time travel on JQ international to Honolulu not expecting much but very impressed. Purchased tickets months out so had the opportunity to get business class at a good price. Wide leather seats drink before departure and order off the menu adds the nice touch. Plenty of drinks and snacks after dinner and service very attentive. Stewardess very friendly and gave some tips on Hawaii as this first time there. Very impressed with the service and general experience overall. IFE limited but ok. If you can afford business class do it.,0
"The airline had misplaced my luggage and after raising the issue at the Airlines baggage claims section, I was provided a contact number and told to call the number the next day and it will be sorted in a day or two. I've been trying to reach them since the past three days but no one answered the calls. I wasn't expecting this kind of attitude from the staffs. I'm giving this review for the pathetic service from the ground staff handling the baggage section",0
While at Singapore Changi Airport it took me more than 2.5 hrs to queue just to check in. The AirAsia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. There was not enough staff to manage the queue many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. Many passengers were late to board the plane not to mention time to shop the DFS stores. My flight to Bali took off an hour late. Worst experience I had with a budget airline.,1
"Ive been travelling for months and this is the worst airline Ive used. The two flights I had with them were both over an hour late. My flight was cancelled hours before departure with no explanation. I then had to spend 5 hours at the airport while they processed everyone. I was told the earliest rebooking was for the next day. I was offered no compensation or good-will gesture for the fact that I was losing money from my hotel reservation at my destination (and possibly losing my booking since I would be put down as a no-show). I didnt have a Philippines SIM card because I wasnt supposed to be there so I couldnt talk to the hotel (who only have a phone number available for contact). We were all transported to a hotel but given no instructions whatsoever. I had to call down several times just to find out when food would be served, and when the bus would pick us up to take us to the airport the next day. Unless you asked, no information was given to you. I talked to several customer service reps and they were all incredibly useless. It almost felt like they were purposely being incompetent to avoid giving any compensation. This is the worst airline Ive ever flown with and I wish nothing but the worst for them! The flight the next day was about an hour late to take off. And no food was provided on a 9 hour flight unless you paid. Ive been on 1 hour flights with budget airlines that have provided food.",1
"Jetstar is a budget airline, which is why I generally avoid flying with them. But in this case did not even get on to the plane. It was cancelled due to ""crewing requirements"", according to e-mail sent to me two hours before the flight was due to leave. The plane had arrived in Darwin, and apparently left empty. As a result, I missed my international connection from Brisbane. When as suggested I contacted Jetstar by phone, I went through their voice recognition system which was aggravatingly useless, and ended up giving the same information that the useless computer system had requested to a live person in the Philippines. Fortunately my employer has a policy of never using Jetstar if an alternative is available so I have rebooked on another airline. Only good thing in all of this is that the Filipino on the other end of the phone was polite and did as much as they could given severe constraints on doing anything useful.",1
"Phuket to Singapore. Booked flights online for me and my girlfriend. When we checked in at the airport 2h30 mins before, Scoot had split us at 2 different parts of the plane. No reason given and despite showing the booking, nothing done (flight full). They wanted to have a printed itinerary. Great example of how clueless Scoot can be with their customers, there are way too many other cheap airlines in SEA to avoid them. I don't see any added value to picking them and I do travel regularly.",1
"My flight was delayed 4 hours from Bangkok to Singapore. Initially the flight is 1055pm, we enter into flight about 1230am. Though it was no more delay, but pilot announce flight will delayed another 45min and again 45 minutes. We didn't give any voucher or meals or drink between this 4 hours delay. After landed at Singapore, I asked Scoot for compensate this delay. They reply my email within 8 hours with compensate SGD200 voucher to me by email.",0
"Early morning AirAsia flight from Don Meuang airport to Bali. Reserved row 1 - and got priority boarding which was well organized. Flight departed on schedule, and crew was friendly. Space sufficient in row 1 - but would either order a seat in the first rows - or the exit row, as other seats had very limited space. Excellent price paid, would fly again.",0
"Gold Coast to Melbourne. This airline knows nothing about customer experience. They weight your luggage at the gate and with only being one kilo over, I was made to pay an additional $60 to check my bag. Considering my actual check luggage was 6kg under, it would be best practice customer service to check in the system and include it in that. I will never be flying Jetstar again.",1
BKK-MEL Star Class. 4 hours delay from BKK but staff handled the delay in a professional way. Seat wide and good legroom and recline food delicious and managed to get some sleep. Overall very satisfied.,0
"Yet another comfortable, friendly and smooth IndiGo flight flying from Pune to Bangkok via Kolkata. A caveat: In a hundred international flights into Bangkok in the past two decades, for the first time ever in my experience, an airline (IndiGo) did not have Thai immigration forms. Anybody who has been through immigration at Suvarnbhumi expects a wait of up to one hour. So, to not have immigration forms on board a flight can develop into an even longer wait. Come on, IndiGo! Otherwise, as usual, a flawless IndiGo flight.",0
"Jetstar's Star Class isn't the height of luxury, but I was impressed by the great value for money it offers. Check-in was a breeze, and onboard the seat was broad and comfortable (for a day flight at least). The crew service was excellent, better than in many ""real business class cabins, there was welcoming bubbly and the meals were fine. The Dreamliner flight operated bang on time. I have a couple more flights booked in Jetstar Airways Star Class, and don't feel apprehensive about them now.",0
BOM-BDQ on A320. Check-in was not as efficient as I have know Indigo to have. But it was not a problem. We were kept waiting for take-off due to congestion but flight itself was pretty standard efficient Indigo. The chief FA seemed rushed while making announcements.,0
The service was good compared to other value airlines. The food served was enough and I was contented. I really think that the airline was indeed perfect and more preferable to me.,1
"A complete waste of my time. Received an email suggesting that they had altered my return flight by 2 hours with a big click here button to accept the change. However when I received my actual booking on the website they had in fact changed my departure date by 3 whole days. No easy way to claim a refund. A Chat BOT said a claim form would be sent within 1 day, it has not arrived. Furthermore the quickest that can expect a refund is 10 days. A shambles of a company.",1
3 years I haven't seen my sister. I only had 1 day in Melbourne I was able to see her. Jetstar then cancelled my flight at the last possible second and I'm not able to see her. Jetstar is the worst.,1
"The flight I took from Bangkok to Tokyo was a second half from Singapore to Tokyo Narita via Bangkok Don Muang. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised. The aircraft was new and the the cabin was clean. The seat was fairly comfortable but the legroom is average. Luckily, the flight was fairly empty so I got my whole row for myself for sleep (this was an overnight flight). The seat contained magazines, safety card but no air sickness bag. The price of the food and anything else was expensive. The cabin crew were friendly but not motivated. The flight departed and arrived on time. The toilet was clean but very small. Nothing really special in this flight as this is a red-eye flight. Overall, this flight was average and pleasant flight.",1
"First time travelling after 2 years absence from Covid restrictions. Overall service was poor. Purchase the pre-departure PCR test from Scoot and the instructions were poor. Send in a query but no reply. Flight to Bangkok from Singapore was delayed. Flight back from Bangkok was delayed even longer when last minute cargo loading took up almost 30 mins. Had deliberately avoided Scoot prior to Covid but with times so bad, I thought it was worth supporting our home airline. But at my expense.",1
Brisbane to Mackay. Ive faced a bad experience in the early morning with Jetstar officers at Brisbane airport. This ruined my whole travel mood. They charged me extra $65 for my laptop. They said the carry on luggage which is 7kg should include the laptop as well.  But Jetstar having another procedures. They should have clearly mentioned it in their website. Because the students usually carry their laptops with them. If they mentioned it we could have get another 5kg extra for just $10-$20 rather spending $65. Horrible service. I never ever travel with Jetstar again.,1
My wife and myself flew return Brisbane-Darwin on the new A320. What a joke. The seats are flat and hard and the seat backs uncomfortable. Seat pitch is 28 inches. So if you like the seat back in front of you less than a A4 page away just wait until the passenger in front reclines. Trying very hard to be Australia's Ryanair.,1
"Avoid this airline. Awful experience every time I fly with them. Flights get cancelled for no reason. Flights constantly get delayed, and delayed, and delayed again. Customer service is shocking, updates on new arrival and departure times are slow. Seats are very cramped, hand luggage is checked for the 7kg limit and they will stop you boarding if you are over and don't pay extra. It's just and all round horrible experience flying with this company.",1
Nov 4 2013. Route: HYD-BLR. I have been a frequent flyer on Indigo over the years and the airline has never failed to deliver. As noted by others here spotless aircraft helpful crew members and on-time service are what set it apart. I recommend the airline to all my friends visiting India from abroad. I'm flying Indigo's international service for the first time next year and am looking forward to the same level of service.,0
"Our holiday package to Hawaii and return flying Sydney to Honolulu included Jetstar, which made us hesitate, but the chance to fly on the new 787 won us over. This flight was the pits! The check-in system crashed as we were checking in, so the whole airport experience was slower than usual. On boarding the plane and seeing the seats for the first time, we were stunned - 17"" width and 30"" pitch of the cattle class seats would be good for our 9 year old grandson, but these are not fit for any adult. I am not the smallest of 64 year old males, nor am I the biggest, but my shoulders would not fit giving me no wriggle room. We paid extra for an exit row, thank heavens for that, so we had plenty of leg room. The 3-3-3 configuration is far too tight for any sort of comfort. The aircraft is actually very noisy compared to others we have flown on, so you need a good set of noise-cancelling headphones. We also paid for the food package, which was not worth it - lousy food (we are still trying to identify the meat). The hotdog for breakfast (!) on the return flight was unexpected and we had to wait ages to have the rubbish collected. The staff are not a happy bunch of vegemites, rarely smiling, and rarely seen as they all managed to go to the back of the plane and have a sleep - something which we could not achieve. Never again will we fly Jetstar.",1
Flew from Mumbai to Chennai on February 23rd 2012. Enjoyed the experience and was impressed with the service and the inflight magazine.,0
If you are looking to enjoy a comfortable flight then look no further than Indigo. I am quite fussy about my travelling because of which I have completely put my faith in Indigo Airlines. I love the fact that the flights are punctual and the passengers are not made to wait. The flight attendants welcome you with a warm smile and make you feel comfortable. The flights are well maintained and the washrooms are also hygienic. The crew and the management have certainly done a wonderful job in keeping their patrons happy and satisfied. There was plenty of legroom available on-board even though my flight was full. If you are planning to travel with elderly people then do not worry. The staff are extremely friendly. This airline has always been my preference over others. I will strongly recommend their services.,0
"First time Jetstar flyer, was not aware of such a strict carry-on baggage weight limit. Flight from Cairns to Sydney was delayed in departure, and scales were brought out in a rush. I was first in line. Agent said I had to pay $60 fee for excess carry-on. Thinking we were boarding immediately, I had no choice but to pay $60. However, the flight still didnt go due to aircraft malfunction. Subsequently, a 3.5 hour delay and a new aircraft. In the interim, I unloaded items from my bag bringing the weight down to 7 kg or less. Thought bags would be re-weighed when a flight was rescheduled and I would be entitled to a refund. Rush again to board the delayed flight at another gate. Bags were not weighed for that flight. I asked agent for a refund of my $60 cash because I was boarding the aircraft with less than 7 kg. She said contact Customer Service upon arrival in Sydney. The kiosk was unstaffed in Sydney. Emailed Customer Service and was told no refund was possible. I asked for different compensation such as an upgrade or meal voucher for my next flight 3 days later. Not possible, they said, because it was a separate booking. Totally unwilling to mitigate the circumstances, even when the flight was 3.5 hours late departing Cairns, and even though my carry-on luggage was not in excess of 7 kg upon departure. Bum deal, JetStar. You will never again have my business.",1
"Gold Coast to Sydney. Delayed, then continually delayed (did not notify us), then cancelled (also did not notify us until after I'd found out and booked with another airline). They had already cancelled my flight up on Saturday and now this one too? I had no choice but to book another airline to get up here, and have had to do the same to get home - a day late. I accepted the voucher for the first one but I'll fight them for a refund this time. Terrible communication and service. Don't use Jetstar Airways.",1
Great flight with Jetstar Airways from Christchurch to Auckland. Great food and the staff were very friendly. I suppose the only bad thing was a delayed flight. But overall I am happy. Jetstar meets all expectations. One time my partners flight was late and he was given a free voucher.,0
"Sibu to Kota Kinabalu. I miss the flight due the aircraft left 13 minutes before scheduled departure time. When approached the ground staff the only explanation they gave me, is very common so is my fault that I miss the flight. I had to reschedule all my appointment and pay extra for a new ticket. The worst experience by far.",1
I commented earlier about my bad experience from MEL-BNE last week well the return flight from BNE-MEL JQ006 was no better. The flight was delayed by well over an hour due to Jetstar not being able to find a passenger. Don't we all scan in for a reason? Firstly we had to be there well before as it was an international stopover flight for our domestic portion so I had to queue at customs. Then they decided to delay 300+ passengers on Australia day Then after already costing me $247 more from the trip up they wouldn't even give us a drink. I was told I had to purchase one and the staff couldn't care less. Never again.,1
"Horrible service, Delayed 5 hours without anybody to contact. No compensation, no foods or drinks. We just had to wait and ask for info. Staf can barely speak English and they are scrolling on their Instagram while talking to you. Try to avoid this company at all costs.",1
Flight from Guangzhou to Kuala Lumpur. All of their service is what the low cost airlines have. Normal seat without IFE without food serving. Recommend during great promotion and travel with only cabin baggage (quite expensive check-in baggage fee).,1
"Melbourne Avalon to Sydney on the 21st November, the 15.45 service. Arrived at the terminal punctually, went through check-in and security swiftly, and was given an excellent seat by the ground crew (who also overlooked the fact that my baggage was 1KG over). Onboard, the service was fairly good (but not great) for a run-of-the-mill Jetstar flight, and we landed in SYD 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Overall, Id recommend Jetstar if there was a great sale, or if using Avalon, where the ground crew are consistently exceeding expectations as well as the airline being able to offer cheaper prices from this airport.",0
"Jakarta to Singapore With Lion Air. The ticket was very cheap and that is the reason why I choose Lion Air. The flight was a bit late for take off but landed on time. The check in was smooth and the ground staff was kind and quite helpful. Cabin staff cabin were welcoming and friendly to us. The seat were as normal as taking a low cost carrier. Overall, it is quite ok for this flight.",0
"2 hours before the flight from Kaohsiung to Singapore, Scoot sent an email saying the flight was delayed until at least the next day and the plane was grounded. They gave no compensation for overnight stay and would only refund the amount of the flight as a Scoot voucher and also would not refund the extras purchased such as business upgrade and checked in baggage.",1
"Yet again, Jetstar shines brightly in the LCC skies. Simplicity and efficiency go hand in hand with another two flights from Hobart to Melbourne made so pleasant by the friendliness of happy and competent Cabin Crews, battling to satisfy very demanding passengers on short (less than one hour) flights. I would like to see the removal of food/drink services on short flights. Less weight using less fuel may even reduce costs further? A dream perhaps, but one worth considering. I cannot rate this airline highly enough. I am totally satisfied from check-in to baggage collection.",0
"Our flight from Melbourne to Busselton (West Australia) was cancelled due to the COVID -19 pandemic. I was contacted by Jetstar to inform me of the cancellation and was informed that I could get a credit or reschedule . They also advised that I could get a refund by contacting them. I decided on a refund as it gives me the most flexibility. I expect to be in for a big protracted struggle when in fact the opposite was the case. I phoned the contact centre number and was talking to a person within 3 minutes. I explained my situation and they informed me that I qualify for a refund and that it would be processed within 2 weeks. True to their world I received the cash into my credit card account today. Jetstar gets some bad press sometimes, in this instance they were true to their word and provided good service.",0
"I cant believe how awful service they have. I needed to rebook a flight with them, not only I couldnt do it online, but when I went to do it personally at the ticketing office at the airport they wanted to charge me over double the original price When I asked why so expensive, the lady at the counter couldnt even explained me wh. I ended up booking in AirAsia.com and losing the flight, time and money with Cebu Pacific. Please dont make the same mistake I did and go to other airline!",1
"Christchurch to Auckland. Worst airline every step of the way. Perpetually understaffed. I ended up paying $150 for an extra bag even though I had already paid, already flown one leg with it, and showed a receipt for the payment. Also, their extra bag fee is $60, not $150 that I was charged. The staff spent so much time figuring out what to do with my receipt that was not in their system, that I was about to miss the flight, gave up, and paid any number just to depart and make my connection. And after all that they damaged my fragile cargo, which I fly with all over the world and no other airline has ever had a problem handling. Fly the competitor, trust me.",1
"Sapporo to Tokyo Narita. You might think you are saving a few bucks upfront, but in the end you will pay out the nose. The bag drop line took over one hour. The flight was delayed one hour because they didn't get the baggage count right. We missed our bus transfer, and had to buy new tickets. Not that big of a deal. Then, on our way home from Sapporo to Tokyo, we checked in, waited a few hours only to find out that our flights were cancelled, and we'd be missing our connection to Canada. We scrambled to find a different airline, but are now paying 3x more for flights, early morning taxis, train tickets that aren't being used, and extra baggage fees. I will never recommend them to anyone. The airplane itself was fine. At least you have that going for yourselves.",1
"Denpasar to Sydney. I couldnt check in online or over the phone. It is our honeymoon and we wouldve like to pick a window seat to sit together but they have placed us in the middle of the plane. Weve left ample time to check in, they have bullet points for rules to check in and none of them applied to us and yet we still cannot check in or choose a seat. Called the number and they could still not help us out at all. Useless service, and now we are stuck in the middle of a plane for six hours. Thanks a lot Jetstar. Will never use you again.",1
"Absolutely awful customer service and outlandish fees for baggage travelling with Jetstar Airways from Bali to Cairns. It's worth flying a more expensive airline as you will get massively overcharged for your bags with Jeststar, so it is not worth the savings. We were charged 570USD for 2 bags! That is twice the price of our tickets. Will never fly Jetstar Airways again and will certainly never suggest to anyone else. Very disappointing.",1
"My wife and I flew from Perth to Japan with Scoot in Feb 2017. We booked with Scoot as they had convenient flights to our destination and flew through Singapore Changi Airport (No.1 in the world according to us). We were flying Scoot Biz there and back, mainly for my wife's comfort. My wife has mobility problems, so we advised Scoot that we'd need Special Assistance at each airport we used (5 in all). Being that Scoot is a Low Cost Carrier, I was a bit dubious that they'd be reliable in actioning this request, but I'm very pleased to report that not only did they give us Special Assistance at every stage, but I'd have to say it was brilliant Special Assistance. Whether it was at the airport, where the service is provided by a contract company, or in the air, the service was nothing short of exceptional. I'd like to make special mention of the cabin staff on all of our flights. The girls in the cabin (no boys on our flights that I saw), were absolutely wonderful. My wife only had to blink and they sprang to her aid, helping her getting on and off the aircraft, as well as being continually attentive on board. I couldn't fault their service ethic and they were genuinely happy to help her, whenever she needed it. Operationally, every flight was ontime and their Dreamliners were beautiful aircraft to fly in. Just prior to our return to Australia, one of their Dreamliners was hit and damaged by another aircraft, in a ground handling incident at Changi. I thought that this may lead to delays on our flights, as I'm sure they fully use their 12 aircraft, but it had no obvious effect for us. Scoot was world class and any full service airline wouldn't have been able to do more for us than Scoot did. My wife and I were very satisfied with all aspects of Scoot's service and will definitely continue to use them and will encourage others we come into contact with, to do likewise. Extremely well done Scoot!",0
"Worse customer service. Every email came back as undeliverable, every phone number goes to voice mail. The recording says you can talk to live person via app and website, but it's just a computer chat that can't do anything. Flight was okay, but everything else about this airline was bad. Rudest gate and ticket people I've met.",1
Refused boarding on Jetstar because I was 3.5 minutes late for check in with only hand luggage. Ticket bought through Qantas but it turns out you can't check in to a Jetstar flight using the Qantas website. No redirection to Jetstar website no assistance on the phone. Stuck overnight in Hobart without even a toothbrush. No attempt to try and get me on the plane. Boarding then called 5 minutes after I arrived at check in desk. Charged $100 'late' fee and then travelled the following day in row 31 with no window.,1
"Clark to Heathrow via Singapore. I just had the most horrendous flight experience because of this airline! I had no choice but to fly Scoot as they are a sister airline of Singapore Airlines. I bought my ticket via the Singapore Airline website from Heathrow to Clark. The last leg of the journey, Singapore to Clark is via this horrible airline and vice versa on the return journey. The seats are horrible, service is non-existent, the whole flight is completely way below expectation from beginning to end! The worst came on my return journey to London wherein the Scoot flight was late departing Clark by 5 hours due to technical difficulties. I missed my connecting flight to London via Singapore Airlines! The worst part was neither Scoot nor Singapore Airlines took responsibility for what happened. I along with 5 other passengers in the same flight were left to fend and find out what we need to do on our own once we landed in Singapore, we were not given any instructions and the customer service was atrocious! After finding out that 4 of us will have to wait 12 plus hours after being placed on standby no help, explanation nor accommodation were offered! If I did not demand for accommodation, which I was still not given, I would not have been offered access to one of the lower level lounges! They actually expected the stranded passengers to sit and wait no matter how long it takes to get us on a flight, it took me 44 hours to get back to the UK after everything! Apologies from Scoot or Singapore Airlines?! Nothing! And by the way, my luggage was delivered 5 days after my departure!!! Absolutely avoid this trash airline!",1
"AirAsia flight was on-time and full to brim. I did pre-booked meals, Nasi Lemak and Satay but not having it onboard. The crew gave me those meals and complimentary mineral waters inside the plastic bag for take away. I always do this because AirAsia foods are excellent airline foods, even better than some full carrier business class meals. JHB based crew were presentable, enjoyed their work and put safety beyond anything. They dimmed the cabin light when most of passengers seems to dozed off on this evening flight. Beware of the last row, seats cannot be reclined! I will ensure to buy the seating whenever flying more than 2 hours.",0
"Queenstown to Auckland. Bad customer service. First staff advised me to transfer 2 kg off my hand carry to my suitcase I'm checking in, as it can go up to 32 kg and 10 kg for my hand carry. As me and my had husband arranged it promptly, when we came back, that staff is no longer there and other staff told us that's not right. I told them to just tell us how much is the extra after dealing with the drama. Bad customer service. They better sort their front staff give them a good training. Stop telling lies as truly, this airline reputation has gone downhill and will never use them again.",1
Flew MEL-DPS on 14 Nov on the 787 neat new aircraft - food was disappointing - not worth the $15 AUD. You are better off having a nice feed at the airport before take off. Drinks etc as expected overpriced not many options once you're in the air. Staff were doing the bare minimum to make things better. Just because its a low cost carrier it should not equate to a Low Level of Service. Certainly will be considering other options before booking Jetstar again.,1
It's a quick trip between these 2 cities but passengers spend longer at the airports than on the plane. Bag drop at Melbourne was a slow process. About 50 people in line and only 4 of the 12 desks operating. When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient. Despite the aircraft being on the ground for a good 35 minutes most of the windows were grubby. The flight was fine and I had about 2cm between my knees and the seat in front. Thankfully they didn't recline the seat. A 15 minute delay in Sydney waiting for a clear air-bridge and a 20 minute wait to collect our bags capped off an uneventful flight.,0
April 5 2013 we were scheduled to fly to Manila from Naga for our connecting flight to Bangkok. One hour before boarding we received an announcement that there was a delay of 3 hours. We didn't leave until after 5pm our flight on Philippine Airlines was scheduled to depart at 7.20 pm. Ended up arriving in Manila 6.50 pm. Prior to departing Naga we had told the crew of our situation and they promised us that they will talk to the captain and other crew and that they will assist us with getting our check-in bag immediately instead of getting it from the carousel. However we discovered was that no one had communicated with any other crew members about us. They did not allow us to take our baggage right after stepping out of the plane; we had to wait for our baggage like everyone else. When we finally gathered our belongings we needed to run to catch a taxi to Terminal 1. Ended up missing our flight to Bangkok. Ended up paying $630 + to book a Kuwait bound to Bangkok.,1
"I booked the flight to Bali. I reached Denpasar 10:30 am today and after searching for my luggage for 2 hrs, I asked at the airport about it and they said that your luggage has not been picked up from Sydney. We had our little son with us and all luggage was checked in. They said it will be delivered by the next flight to Bali from Sydney. But nothing got delivered so far. Its been a day without clothing. I end up with spending hundreds dollars worth of clothing. I have booked the meal already while booking the flight. Staff asked to give them proof of meal booked. I mean they don't have any information about anything and they refused to give a meal. I paid twice for same meal. Worst service ever. Do not spoil your holidays by travelling with them.",1
"More than week ago, we had trip from Bangkok to Singapore (B777). Comfort of B777 is like standard, nothing special. Definitely there is problem with mobile and website to do online check-in. This doesn't work for DMK airport in Thailand. We had an situation before take off (on ground) and no one from staff were interested with this. we have been informed now we are starting take off procedure, and it's impossible to get up. My expectation where to get priority help from staff. I had to explain all crew members what was the problem in front of all other people and that was embarasing.  I couldn't buy a water due to ""sale is closed"".  My complain to Scoot was sent through website, after more than week I have response: ""during take off it's not allowed to use lavatory"".",1
"Would not recommend this airline. I had a terrible experience with them flying to Indonesia last year. I was told by a friend that they are terrible on route to New Zealand. Now I booked again from Athens to Berlin because it was the only flight for the times I needed. They were absolutely terrible. They have silly policies enforced by incredibly rude and unhelpful flight attendants that definitely do not put the customer first. Seat comfort is awful if you're a little taller than average, especially for a long flight. Lots of additional charges and lots of annoying rules make this flight more frustrating. No online check in was possible, so needed to be even earlier for a 8am flight. I will never book with them again.",1
Pune to Nagpur return. Smooth efficient check in. Flight 80 minutes with breakfast you can buy onboard. Due to turbulence the cart never got to where we were. Staff very pleasant. Return trip late evening flight. Delayed by 45 mins but managed to do a quick turn around and got us to Pune on time.,0
"Speedy check in. Boarding as typical in Pune airport. Not very organised, but still went well. Plane was very clean. Crisp and new feeling. Crew was smiling. My first experience on this airline, and will stick to it when travelling inside India. It is a low Cost but for Low Costs it ticks all the Boxes.",0
Super nice budget airline. Clean and stylish interior. Super friendly staff. I fly from Lax to Tokyo for about 200 bucks. Brought my own food and drinks. Hard to beat!,0
"KUL-SIN-KUL day return, 2nd time using Air Asia. I don't normally use Low cost airlines however for short trips I find them fine. Web check in for both flights quick and easy I had no baggage so straight through security and immigration. Boarding done by row and I had seat 1A, flight left on time and arrived spot on time. Flight time of 45 min, seat comfortable and was given a water by the young nice crew. Return once again checked in on the web so straight through the efficient Changi immigration and security to gate D37. Boarding fairly orderly although done by row number and again 1A. Flight departed on time but due to poor weather took a little longer, around 1hr 10min. The crew were unable to serve anything due to the turbulence but otherwise flight was fine. If using this airline, pay a little more for a hot seat, it's worth the few . This return trip cost me almost 100% less than the others on this route.",0
"Legazpi to Manila. First time flying on Cebu Pacific on this route. I must say that it was beyond my expectations. Flight left on time. Crew were cheerful, it was value for money. Bought my ticket for around 700 Php which is way way better than taking riding 10-hour bus ride to MNL for double the price. Cebu Pacific is an excellent choice if you're able to chance upon their seat promotions 3 to 4 months before your flight.",0
BDQ-HYD via BOM. The check-in at Vadodara was smooth though they did not give me through check in to Hyderabad. I had to claim my luggage and re-check in at Mumbai but it was smooth. Ground staff courteous and efficient. Aircraft clean cabin crew efficient and courteous. Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic. Overall not bad at all.,0
Sydney-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. Seats 25 over wing. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for Christmas Day. Meal was ok - probably would have been nicer if it was hotter. Staff onboard very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a touch narrow and sitting on the aisle I was continually bumped. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.,0
"Flew in Full Flat, extra pay for suit case, no lounge and no free food or beverage during flight provided. Cabin crew extremely unprofessional and rude to me.",1
"I've had bad experiences with Cebu Pacific before, but none quite as bad as the latest. Our flight to Hong Kong (from Manila) was scheduled for 15.35 on Feb 17. We boarded on time, and (stupidly) I believed that everything would go as planned. After driving around the runway forever, the pilot announced there was a ""technical difficulty"" and we would be returning to the boarding gate. This resulted in a fun hour long delay during which nothing was explained. After an hour of waiting, the pilot announced we would be leaving shortly. We left Manila and I (once again, stupidly) believed that all was well. After 20 minutes of flying, the pilot announced that there were technical difficulties and that we would need to turn around and go back to Manila. Upon landing in Manila at 7pm, we were assured that a new plane was available and we could board it at 8pm. Well, we boarded at 8. It is now 9.30 and we still haven't left yet. I will not be flying with Cebu Pacific again. I strongly recommend that you don't either, unless you enjoy wasting your money and being messed around for several hours. As a fun little treat, the live agent on their website was useless and unhelpful. Did not even attempt to answer my questions in any way, shape or form. If you fly with them after reading this, good luck and godspeed.",1
"Overall a very poor experience with Scoot when compared with other budget airlines. It was our first time so we did not realise the biz class seats did not recline much and the leg rest also did not come up. We bought biz cos we thought we would get a better rest on the redeye but instead, passengers in economy were able to take 2-3 seats and lie down while there is a non-movable handrest between the biz seats and my toddler couldn't lie on my lap so ended up being even more uncomfortable. I brought packet oats for my toddler and wanted just a bowl of hot water but even that could not be accommodated. I guess this is budget but I don't know what biz class I was paying for. On the return flight, we missed the cutoff for the checkin counter by 5 min, that is clearly our bad as we didn't know it was 1 hour cutoff (In Singapore mostly 40 min) but what annoyed was the scoot counter staff attitude. It's tough for anyone to miss their flights but they were really mean and rude about it. I then realised the Economy class passengers for this flight were still being checked in and asked why we couldn't then get on but she said its because we were not already in the queue by the 1 hour mark. So it wasn't like the counter had closed which I would fully understand but just for the principle of it. This inflexibility really put me off. Next she tells me too bad, the tickets are non-refundable (we paid $2700 for the 3 tickets - not exactly cheap cos i wrongly thought biz class was worth it). They had no scoot counter at the airport and there is no wifi at the airport. So I had to make multiple long-distance calls to find out tomorrow's flight would cost be another $2k. At this point, I gave up and opted to buy 3 new full-fare ticket on SIA from Brisbane airport. It was a mistake to fly Scoot. Should have just flown a return flight on SIA from the get-go. Somehow I bought being a SIA subsidiary meant I was getting a similar customer service which was not the case.",1
Mar 6 2014 DXB-MNL New A330-200 aircraft was used and its so refreshing once u enter on the plane seat is narrow for economy flight crew were polite and always smiling. Very cheap fare compared to others on time departure from DXB and arrival in MNL. Will definitely fly this airline again.,0
"Melbourne to Sydney. I went to get my luggage weighed and was 2kg over. Upon asking questions regarding the charge of a $60 flat fee, I was answered by the check in staff member stating I dont have to explain myself. I am highly disgusted at her abrupt attitude. Possibly may be that she is an older staff member an needs another induction in customer service. When I asked her for her name, she became defiant refusing to give me her name. She told her supervisor, who was very professional and encouraged us to voice our concerns online- he was more concerned about the delayed flights on the day - prioritising real problems. When we finally made it on the plane, someone was sitting in my seat. One of the cabin staff said to the passenger move your in the wrong seat- youre holding everyone up he was apologetic, never flying with this airline again. Were finally sitting down 18 minutes later and havent taken off yet.",1
SIN-DPS-SIN both flights using the new B737-900ER. Cabin clean bright and airy. I was impressed that food (hot meal dessert and salad - all served on a tray) + drinks were served for both flights. Pity that load factor for both legs was less than 40% and no inflight entertainment was offered at all. It's a great flying experience overall.,1
Brisbane to Bangkok return. We paid $1430 for four of us to fly to Bangkok return. I had a couple of queries prior to flying and emails were promptly replied to and information provided. All four flights on time. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient. We did pre-order a meal Coolangatta to Singapore which admittedly I will not be doing again - the worst airline meal I have ever had. We learnt our lesson and didn't worry with the on board food service again. I noticed a number of reviewers complained about lengthy check-in queues - perhaps we were lucky but we had no such difficulties. I should mention that between the four of us we did only have 3 small backpacks which were less then 7kg in weight and we checked them in as cabin luggage. On the way home we did arrive at both Bangkok and Singapore airports quite early (around 3.5 hours) due to an early flight from Koh Samui and an overnight in Singapore. So we were the first ones to check in. this worked in our favour as we were for some reason automatically upgraded to the yellow seats on both sectors. they are definitely more comfy and have more leg room then the blue seats. However to be honest we are not big people (average height average build) so the blue seats were fine for us anyway if you were taller or bigger in size it may be more uncomfortable I guess. Overall we had a great experience with Scoot. The price was incredibly cheap at just over $1400 for four of us.,0
"Trichy to Singapore. The flight was delayed 1/2 an hour. The seats were cramped. The food was expensive. The crew was nice, but not motivated. Seats were ok, but not too comfy. But it was worth the price.",0
"I flew on Zipair on my back from Tokyo Narita -> SJC. I had missed my airlines from (Singapore Airlines) which was headed to LAX, and Alaska Airlines connecting flight to SJC. I was in a huge bind because I had missed my original return flight and re-booking with Singapore airlines cost several thousand dollars + an additional fee of 300 dollars. Luckily I was able to book through ZIPAIR last minute and got a flight from NRT -> SJC directly for roughly 424 dollars. This saved me a lot of time and trouble and I had no problems with the airlines. It would be nice if they had a few more amenities or food but a roughly 10 hour direct flight which was offered last minute. Cannot complain and would recommend this airline. I am surprised for many of the other reviews which I am guessing have to do with refund issues or cancellations. I would book zipair if I was certain about my flight information and timings and didn't want to change.",0
Melbourne to Uluru. Jetstar is a budget airline so don't expect all the frills that come with a full service airline. What I am looking for is courteous service and delivering me from point A to point B comfortably and safely. This they did well. The plane left Melbourne a little late but that was due to Melbourne airport traffic. They made up most of the time and was only 5 minutes late. The cabin staff went about their job in a business like and cheerful manner.,0
"Business class on Jetstar's Boeing 787 dreamliner from Melbourne to Honolulu. In short, save your money. Business class on Jetstar is not worth it. Tiny cabin, only three rows, 2-3-2 configuration, which is shocking for business class. Narrow, cramped seats with minimal recline and a pretty useless footrest. Food was unimpressive. The crew was very friendly, which was the only plus. Jetstar is a budget airline targeting families and holiday makers, so it's not designed to cater for business travelers. Also, the flight was full of screaming babies, which made sleeping nearly impossible. Pick another airline or fly economy, which is a decent product for the price.",1
Last month was my second flight on Jetstar from Melbourne to Bangkok return. Food and drink both have to be purchased on board or online during booking which is fair enough as it is a cheap airline fare. Leaving Melbourne we were aware of this and took our own sandwiches and bottled water purchased in the Duty Free area at Tullamarine - no problem. On both return journeys - at Bangkok airport - our bags were searched before boarding and all water was confiscated from passengers. Although we could purchase drinks and snacks using a credit card on-board we did not. Surely Jetstar could at least provide free bottled water to dehydrated passengers. Maybe I just expect too much.,1
BLR-KUL-REP. The seats are tight. If you are tall you're going to have a problem. On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.,0
We found Scoot to be very satisfactory when traveling to Singapore. The check-in was quick as was boarding and the in-flight staff were nice. We had no problems and will fly Scoot again.,0
"This was our first AirAsia trip from Perth to Bali. We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters. AirAsia is cheap as chips and very efficient - what's not to like on this easy 3.5  hour run between Perth and Bali.",0
HKT-BKK. Paid for 20Kgs of baggage on their scales at Phuket my case weighed 19.2kgs. 3 hours later the same bag (nothing taken out) weighed in at 16.8Kgs on Qatar Airways scales at BKK. Not the first time I have noticed such a discrepancy. Good value flight though promo ticket with baggage and taxes was around 20GB.,0
"How else can you get out of Darwin to Bali? Jetstar cancelled our flight without much reason given ""come back tomorrow"" - so lost a whole day in Bali with all that went with that next day ""oh dear!"" we're diverting you via Melbourne. So back thousands of miles and then onwards to Bali - more lost time. Compensation offered was laughable. Sincerely given apologies? No way. They don't seem to be able to say sorry. As this was the first step of my journey home to England it didn't help that they also lost my luggage. They don't seem to have any up to date systems even though I gather they're a part of Qantas not that they're going to admit that.",1
I will never fly Jetstar again. On 21st June 2019 I was meant to fly from Perth to Bali the flight was cancelled for no reason at all. I was put on another flight the next day but before I left home I got a text from Jetstar saying my flight was delayed again. I went to the airport and I finally left Perth at 4pm on Saturday afternoon of the 22nd June.,1
Our flight was cancelled on the morning of the flight. AirAsia failed to let us know despite having our contact details. We had to contact them on an international number at great cost. When we did find out they informed us the next flight we could take was in a weeks time but they couldn't help us with accommodation. They offered us a voucher to be used within 3 months. We live in the UK and have 1 holiday a year so this was of no use. We asked them for a refund but they refused despite the fact they could not transport us in a reasonable time. We had to fly a different airline at extra cost. Staff unhelpful and couldn't care less we were stranded. I'd never use AirAsia again.,1
CEB-DPL return. Very strict on baggage your flight will come out more expensive even if you pre-pay for your baggage. No more free baggage allowance on their flights. Ground staff at DPL are unprofessional and chaotic at the counters. Inflight crew carry out their job in a robotic manner.,1
"Bengkulu to Jakarta. This is a budget airline and obviously the air fare is very affordable. I have flown this airline six times to and from Bengkulu in the last year. This last trip, unfortunately, the flight was delayed for over 5 hours. Now, I do not speak Bahasa so I was fortunate that my friend is Indonesian and was able to keep me posted, English is barely spoken at the airport and none of the announcements were made in English. They did provide food to all passengers at the airport and also refunded IDR 300,000.00 to everyone for the delay. That was cash on hand. The flight once we left was fine. Its all economy class jet and one hour flight to Jakarta. I was very pleasantly surprised on the refund part of this experience.",0
"This was the worst airline I have ever flown with. Not even worth the cheap flights. Wanted to do something nice for our honeymoon and we ended up stuck in Bali with none of our luggage and no one knew where it was. Two days later it showed up at our hotel with no notice of its details. We tried to get in contact for compensation and they refuse to email us back and assist us for our troubles. On our flight back to the United States, there was no communication telling us we needed Australian visas for our layover. We spent another hour and a half at the customer service desk. Because of our layover in Sydney, they are making us claim our bags in the Sydney Airport and then pay another big amount to recheck our bags in to fly to Honolulu. This airline is a scam. Dont fly with them. They lack integrity and honesty and will do everything they can to screw you out of a dollar.",1
"My recent flight with Jetstar was a nightmare. The prices were unreasonably high for the dismal service received. From delays and lost luggage to a dirty and untidy plane with an unpleasant smell, it was an overall terrible experience. The staff displayed bad manners, and made it clear that Jetstar is an airline to avoid at all costs.",1
Ridiculous terms and conditions. It was going to cost me more to change my booking than to completely cancel and rebook. I've been bitten twice with this joke of an airline and I will not be using them ever again.,1
"Flew Scoot from Don Muang to Singapore. Didn't expect to be seated in a seat with so much leg room, beside the escape exit door. I thought you would pay a premium for this, but I was allocated this seat and didn't pay a cent for such a comfort. Now I know why people pay more. Being able to stretch your legs is really a luxury. Flight was good, even though there was turbulence. Lighting onboard was fantastic. Crew didn't push, hard sell food and other pay-per-use services. Paid for wi-fi and onboard charging of mobile devices. Scoot just won itself a new (repeat) customer.",0
Singapore-Manila (return). Flight to Manila on an A320. Delayed with no notice or apology in Singapore. It's as if nothing happened. Very tight leg room and no magazines on seat pocket which made the no IFE flight seem longer. Also cabin was not clean with pen marks on seat tray table and bits of chips fell while taking bag from overhead compartment. Return flight was on a new A330. Seats were fairly comfortable and clean cabin. Overall uneventful flights and very cheap fares. I don't mind flying with them again for short haul flights (if given a choice between Cebu Pacific and another airline I will choose the latter) but it's a big no for long haul flights.,0
"Dubai to Cochin was a nice flight at the end of December 2018. Water is provided, but food only provided by payment only. Half an hour delay is normal from Dubai based flights. 45 minutes delayed, but arrived ontime. Got the baggage delivered on time upon arrival at COK. Onboard nothing except the small bottle of water. No entertainment screen. If you have movies on your mobile or tab like devices fly with them.",1
"Bangkok to Siem Reap return. We chose AirAsia because it was the cheapest option and we were very satisfied. On the return flight we had a connection and we had to change airport and discovered it was very easy. Seats were comfortable, flights were both on time, everything was ok. We shipped one laggage and everything was fine.",0
"Adelaide to Darwin. Literally the worst airline ever, don't expect to travel on the flight you booked with Jetstar. Constantly changing times and destinations with no options except accept or receive credit. If you buy a travel voucher, make sure you make it known to the staff. They will not always offer you anything.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Yangon. AirAsia is an ok airline when everything is going smooth. If a problem is occurring, they are unable to attend to customers.  I made a booking for a flight and because the credit card interface did not work, I allowed them to debit my bank account for a ticket. The booking number is even mentioned in the bank account statement but they never sent a ticket. As I had to fly for business trip, I was booking the same flight on the same date again and paid with credit card (this time, it worked).  The customer is providing proof of double payment on the same day, is even giving the booking number of the flight where he did not receive a ticket and providing all information needed for a refund. AirAsia is choosing to ignore me. I tried as well on the counter at the airport in KL, they can't do anything. Therefore, I am now choosing to ignore AirAsia - it's a matter of principle.",1
Flight delayed 8 hours in Melbourne which meant I missed my connecting flight to Bangkok. Was told I could wait 24 hours in Singapore for a connecting flight to Bangkok or wait 2 days in Australia for another flight. Chose to take the delayed flight to Singapore and fly Jetstar. Offered $50 voucher for 8 hour delay in Melbourne but still have not got it. I don't care about delayed flight it can happen with any airline but I should be refunded the flight from Singapore to Bangkok. Have rang many times and they just hang up on you.,1
"I had the opportunity to fly with IndiGo on the 15th of August 2018 from Doha to Mumbai. Always having flown Qatar Airways I had to choose IndiGo due to the time slot. Well, a low cost airline in really had no expectations but at least a decent and hassle free experience as they claim to give. I checked in at the counters and got my boarding pass and I had a handbag of 6kgs which is well below their limit of 7kgs. I purchased duty free which was about 3 kgs. Here comes the tricky part the staff at the boarding gate have a portable weighing scale through which they check the weight of the handbags. I have no issues with that however I wasnt informed at the counters about 7kgs handbag allowance being inclusive of duty free. The staff at the boarding gate (QAS) staff, were rude they do not even try to be polite of courteous and straight away give ultimatums saying throw away the duty free, go back to duty free and return it, however if you do no return in 20 minutes we will offload you from the flight. They forced me to pay 60 riyal per kg for the excess baggage which I was carrying. I wouldnt recommend this airline unless a last resort or a complete emergency. One can only expect low quality service from a low cost airline. Thank you IndiGo for the hassle free experience.",1
Hong Kong - Singapore - Perth. Scoot website needs work and trying to use it to alter anything concerning flight ended up with a 30 minute phone call and then a call back and then another call. This did not give me confidence in the quality of the actual flight but was pleasantly surprised. Flew business class and seating legroom was great for 6ft 6 husband and recline was excellent to get a decent sleep. Food was basic but tasty and fine for a short flight. Staff were really friendly and helpful. My daughter traveled economy and was more than happy with the seating. I have flown with many airlines including other budget carriers and full service airlines. We had just come off a Turkish airlines flight and found Scoot better in terms of comfort. I would definitely fly with them again. Website and customer care before the flight needs improvement.,0
"Indore to Bengaluru. Horrible service at check in counter. I had my flight which was delayed 25 minutes. As I was scared of missing my international connection due to the delay, I asked the staff to put my baggage under priority for releasing on the belt (due to the delay of the flight). Airline staff asked for payment for priority baggage, though the reason was clearly the delay in the flight.",1
"It was my first time with ZipAir and I was a bit leery of flying so far with a budget airline, but it was an enjoyable experience. Off to a good start, the check-in was fast and efficient. I flew in Standard (economy) class with 3-3-3 seating, which was comfortable with adequate legroom. The basic fare is only for the seat, but I opted for the ""value"" package to get 23 kg checked baggage, seat selection plus a meal (pre-selected from a picture menu) and still saved about $500 over the fares of established airlines. Passengers are required to show their boarding pass during flight to verify the optional upgrade. The tasty meal came in a box on a tray, with just beef and rice next to bottled water. There was no salad, dessert nor other drink, But the free Wi-Fi connected to my smart phone allowed ordering drinks and snacks later, as well as compensating for having no seatback screen. The charming cabin attendants were very safety conscious, double-checking to make sure overhead bins were closed securely. ZipAir should be commended for creating a unique budget flying experience on lengthy international flights. Some earlier negative Skytrax reviews were based on unmet pandemic regulations and refund policies, not the flights themselves, Overall, I highly recommend ZipAir as an alternative to traditional carriers whose fares have skyrocketed on the HNL-NRT route since the pandemic, Just follow the their common sense rules and enjoy the money saved.",0
"Have done the Denpasar to Melbourne route with Jetstar for the last few years and always dread the flight home - the Indonesian cabin crew do not seem to have time for customer service and seem abrupt to the point of rudeness. Only interested in getting the cabin service over so they can sit and chat amongst themselves. Have encountered this now on 2 occasions. Whether it's a language barrier I don't know, but no comparison to the friendly Australian crew - will choose another carrier next time for return leg.",0
We had to cancel our flight with CEBU one week before we traveled due to a work emergency and they charged us approx 50% fee to do so then would only refund the remaining 50% in travel credit which must be used in 90 days. This company is predatory we were very disappointed in their policy.,1
"Flew on Scoot from Seoul (ICN) to Singapore (SIN) via Taipei (TPE). Transfer was horrible. Scoot uses a ""transfer card"" system where passengers need to queue up to receive the card before entering the transfer security line however there weren't any signs that tell us anything about this process. Transfer cards are given by EVA Air staff process is very inefficient and slow. There were also no Korean speaking staff and we did see lots of Korean passengers queuing in the wrong line or walking to the wrong place because of the confusing transferring lines.",1
"A short shuttle flight between Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Plane was delayed by over 2.5 hours due to planned closure of airspace by the Malaysian authorities. However, this affected my next flight which had to be changed. On board everything seemed good but the interior does need a bit of a facelift. Boarding was chaotic due to delays. An okay flight for this route, I would choose a different airline if it wasnt for it's price.",0
"My first time on Air Asia, in terms of value for money you simply cannot better its price and often frequency. Nice clean aircraft, excellent crew, on time and comfortable seats. The pre ordered hot meals are not the best, and often not a lot of western choice, but its ok for a short trip. I honestly don't know how some of the airlines get any economy passengers if Air Asia is on the same route.",0
Bangalore to Mumbai. Every time I travel with IndiGo I have no complaints with it. The cabin crew are polite and have a welcoming nature. Followed by the warm welcome was the smooth takeoff. The legroom was fantastic and the seats also wide enough. The food was hot and delicious. The landing was a smooth one and the overall experience is awesome.,0
The most disgraceful airline. Cancelled our flight altogether coming out of Nadi to Sydney. Expected us to accept a flight 2 days later. Incurred 1000s of dollars more rebooking with Virgin and last minute. Do not fly with the company. Getting a refund is near impossible and when you do they tell you they will take a month to give you your money back. Disgraceful JetStar!,1
"Flew Bali to Perth on Jetstar. I had used Qantas FF points to book a ""Rewards"" flight and ended up on Jetstar as Qantas does not fly internationally out of Perth. Go figure. I paid for front row seats so had lots of legroom. I got the legroom and that's it. The seat was hard as a rock and I duidnt want to recline as I would have suffocated the poor passenger behind me. The staff completely disinterested and no service offered. The best I can say is we arrived home safely. We will never fly Jetstar again. Air Asia is far better.",1
"I bought a ticket through AirAsia website for a flight on the 21st of August (Sunday), from Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur. I received an email last Saturday, notifying me that the flight had been canceled due to ""operational reasons"". I tried to understand what these reasons were but I could only contact an automated bot. I eventually got to talk with a so-called live agent (had to wait in queue for 3 hours) that pretended he was typing (the 3 dots pre-message symbol showed up for like 5 minutes) and eventually the conversation ""expired"". I came to understand that the flight they sold me (AK 857) doesn't operate on Sundays. I have another ticket bought from them, for the 25th August (Thursday), from KL to Krabi (AK 868) and I already checked Flightaware and found out that the flight only operates on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I asked for a refund for the flight that got cancelled by AirAsia, but so far I haven't got my money back and from the looks of it, I'm understanding that the same situation will arise with the KL to Krabi flight. Don't trust AirAsia flights and always check on several sites if the flights actually exist and operate on the days they are selling them.",1
"Booked to fly Napier to Auckland. I am not one to write a review but Jetstar has left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. I even went through the effort of reading other reviews and it would seem most others are on the same page as I am. I don't write a story of my experience with Jetstar, I will compile the issues I had into bullet points. Jetstar iPhone application doesn't notify of any errors with checking in online. Jetstar staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. They overbook flights to which they try make you feel responsible for. Seeking renumeration on a Jetstar fault seems like an extremely difficult task. If you are in NZ a want to fly somewhere, use Air New Zealand. They were kind, friendly and more then happy to help after Jetstar left us stranded.",1
"A 7.50am flight from Kuala Lumpur to Makassar. Predeparture announcement was made by the Captain. Departed 15 mins late as heavy traffic at KLIA. The departure gate was right at the end, a real hassle to walk to. It was a smooth flight except about 45 mins before landing, where we encountered slight turbulence. Other than that, the cabin crew were attentive and took care of the passengers.",0
Melbourne to Cairns. I flew with Jetstar Airways to save money as the fares were quite cheap but I should not have bothered as I was slugged with a $60 charge for being 3kgs over as they not only weighed my carry on luggage but my handbag as well - which took it over the 7kg and as I was not aware that my handbag would be taken into account i was less than happy. So no checked in luggage and no in-flight entertainment and no food or drinks served. Add that all up plus the $60 extra charge and you would have to be better off flying a better airline and also you would not have to wait in line like cattle and drag your bags onto the tarmac and up the stairs to the plane. Never again,1
Hubby and I travel to Bali regularly on business and as neither of us are teenagers (and hubby is 6ft 3) we prefer to travel business class. In our experience Jetstar is not as good as it used to be. Attitudes of airline staff are pretty dodgy with only one air steward on our recent flight seeming at all interested in passengers. It is a budget airline but the cleanliness of the cabin should not be compromised. Chewing gum was stuck to the seat in front of me windows were covered in finger prints which indicated a child had sat in the seat on the previous flight and the toilets at the front of the plane were not clean to begin with so were quite revolting by the end of the 6hr flight. To top it off the young couple in the seats directly in front of us reclined their seats as far back as possible so neither my hubby nor I could move his knees were literally squished into the back of the seat. When we asked the air steward to request they pop their seats forward slightly so we could at least move our legs the response was very cool but they eventually acquiesced. When paying so much extra for a little bit of comfort some consideration for the customer is expected. Lift your game Jetstar not good enough!,1
Jakarta-Jogya wasn't a pleasant experience. Plane 1hour late - no info/announcements. Departure lounge overflowing with passengers from 3 late Lion flights. Plane (B737) dirty and shabby with indifferent cabin crew (no checks to see bags properly stowed seats upright for landing/take off etc). Website is good but this doesn't make up for other problems.,1
"Lowest possible rating. Not only were we delayed but staff didnt care, werent helpful and seemed resigned to the delay as a usual occurrence. This airline deserves their last place rating. I wish I had known about it before booking.",1
"Very poor, service help desk assistance. I was about to travel in JQ35 (terminal 2) from Melbourne to Bali on dec7. It is very exhausting moment to see not even single staff handling the service desk before 1 hour of departure. I couldn't catch my flight even though 50 minutes left for departure without check in baggage. I missed following other 3 connecting flights. Also online check-in options wasn't given. Just by providing cheap flights alone, doesn't make your airline the most likable. You need to provide smart assistance.",1
"Christchurch to Bali via Melbourne. Terrible airline, would rather pay extra from now on. Canceling flights 24hr prior and giving a worse flight without telling us. Never again Jetstar, now 17hr flight.",1
"My Spirit Airlines flight from NY to Detroit was delayed. I missed the Spirit Airlines flight from Detroit to LAX because of the delay. The next flight was 12 hours later. Got to LAX at 3pm and missed the ZIPAIR Tokyo flight. Talked to both airlines to resolve issue and both denied to offer me help. Had to ask other airlines for assistance. Zipair denied to help,  I have been sleeping in airports for 4 days now. I had paid for insurance but they didnt care.",1
"Melbourne to Singapore with Jetstar. Overall a pleasant experience, but marred by extremely poor service from Jetstar check-in staff. They ignored Business Class passengers while bickering among themselves, avoiding all eye contact with waiting Jetstar customers. No explanation or apology was given for failing to attend to passengers. After 10 minutes of this we moved to the Economy Class check-in queue, where the process was efficiently handled. I have flown Jetstar Business Class a couple of times and have not encountered such rudeness. Everything else about the flight was fine: punctuality, comfort, friendly and efficient on-board service, and pretty good food. I am sure it was just a couple of rotten apples at the Melbourne Jetstar counters who let the company down, but they urgently need retraining about customer service!",0
"This is the worst service I have ever received from an airline! I spent more than 1000$ USD on a one way ticket only to find that there was no phone number to verify my flight details/requirements. The Japanese and US embassy claimed that I didn't need a visa for Japan to transfer there as long as my flight was within 24 hours. Since my layover in Tokyo was 6 hours I thought I was in the clear. When I got to my departure airport, Noi Bai Hanoi International Airport, the staff would not let me board my flight. Aside from the visa I did not have, the airport staff claimed I needed a negative PCR test, all for only a 6 hour layover in the same day? I used the online chat feature to chat with what seemed like a robot (programmed in India with barely understandable English) prior to my flight. However, this robot could not inform me, nor give me any information regarding where to search for the requirements of flying through Tokyo and needing to recheck my baggage. I am now stuck on an expired visa,. In addition, I need to purchase a 2000$ USD plane ticket home.",1
"Bad service, bad planes, bad organization, bad Webpage and bad customer service. I've tried to buy a flight 3 times, and it doesn't work. I also have call them to solve the problems, and it was impossible. Finally I bought a flight with another company. I won't use Cebu Pacific any more.",1
"Overall, a very good flying experience with IndiGo. Flights on time. Boarding experience good. Airplanes clean inside, and cabin crew responsive to requests. Overall, a very well functioning LCC which meets my expectations.",0
SYD-SIN return. I have only flown once with Scoot and had no real problems. The boarding at both ends was highly efficient and there were no outstanding delays. The 'love seats' were reasonably comfortable with enough leg room. It appears however that I may well have been very lucky. The value for money is excellent but if you can afford it then certainly fly with a full service carrier. Once you pay Scoot for all the add ons the price difference is not really that great. I myself have booked to fly with them again but if I had the money I would not. At the same time I would not consider SIA as Scoot is their offspring.,0
"We had booked and paid for a Bangkok to Singapore flight before COVID as Scoot Plus. It was cancelled because of the crisis. We got a voucher and thought we could fly Scoot Plus business class with the voucher later. The voucher was only a substitute for a refund that we were entitled to.  This is not the case with Scoot. When we booked the replacement flight, there was only Business Class in a Boeing on the route from Bangkok to Singapore, on the return flight only Economy due to a different aircraft and we had to pay extra for excess baggage, for the seat and for boarding first. In total, we paid 47%  extra for worse conditions. On the outward flight, everything worked okay. Scoot cannot organise an immigration fast track for Business Class customers. Long before the trip, we received an email that the departure time had changed. The reason for this was another change of aircraft back to Boeing. That there was now a Business Class after all was not disclosed. At check-in, we were given an Eco ticket in the last row of the plane, although we had been confirmed seats in the first row and had paid a surcharge for them. There was no mention of the paid first boarding. Only after a massive protest the check-in manager gave us seats a little further forward. We were told that Business Class was fully booked. Arriving at the gate, we found an inadequate small waiting room in which the passengers had to wait standing up like sardines in a can. I asked a Scoot employee for a seat and received a shrug. There was no mention of priority boarding.",1
"Kulua Lumpur to Yogyakarta with AirAsia. It was a morning flight, and it departed on time. There was no pre-departure announcement from the captain. The cabin was clean and aircon was cold. The flight was nearly full as it was the start of the school holidays here in Malaysia. The flight was generally smooth all the way. We arrived as scheduled. Landing was okay.",0
"Flew Melbourne to Brisbane. Charged $60 for being 150 grams over their 7kg allowance and had to put up with a rude member of staff tell me that If I dont want to pay I can stay in the airport! I will never fly with them ever again, companies like Jetstar who prey upon their customers and at the same time be so rude need to be sent a loud message!",1
"Disappointing flight. I havent flown AirAsia for some time and seems like its punctuality and service have gone downhill. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. I wasnt informed when I checked in at the airport despite at that point the preceding flights were delayed so they should have been aware. Still no apology for being late when they stated they were ""boarding"" which they stated before the preceding flight had started to disembark. An hour after ""boarding"" they finally opened up the doors for us to get on. Still no apology, little checking of peoples tickets. Once we get on the plane its pretty clear they havent even done a cursory clean which is pretty shocking given the lessons of covid. KL T2 is not a great airport to be stuck in past the security barriers for over 2 hours. So if your flying Air Asia I recommend double checking your flight status before doing that. Or just dont fly AirAsia and maybe you wont have the same risk of long delays and poor service.",1
"Osaka to Cairns on Jetstar JQ16. I chose business class and left the flight feeling that the customer care food and cabin comfort was good. The food which was better than previous flights. My return flight JQ23 from MEL to Tokyo NRT - a very disappointing experience in 20 years of business travel. Check-in was the best customer handling that I had experienced with Jetstar. Two hours later at the gate the boarding process was mismanaged and turned into a stampede of economy and business class passengers jostling for access at the same time. Staff were flustered and lost control. The cabin crew communication customer handling and courtesy was very good. I appreciated their efforts and acknowledge that Jetstar standards has improved. The worst Business Class meal - 3 choices chicken and noodle pea and cheese soup or Hamburger ""raked"" sliced pork. The meal arrived - the hamburger was a dry reheated toasted sandwich with two pickles and mustard. Not a hamburger. One thin slice of pork between soggy reheated toast and pickles. This was not an optional snack this was the main course standard for business class. It gets worse the desert was two shortbread cookies and no tea or coffee. The breakfast was good with fruit yoghurt juice. I requested tea which was cold. I hadn't realised that Jetstar had included an inflatable neck cushion in the the comfort pack - a thoughtful and beneficial improvement however when I tried to brush my teeth before landing the tooth paste was missing and there was no paper cups in the toilet. These basic products are important. I can't brush my teeth so the comfort pack became ineffective. Jetstar is a budget airline it is not Singapore Airlines so fair assessment is needed considering value-for-money. Jetstar has made many improvements with cabin crew and ground staff customer handling skills. As I confirmed in my flight ex-Japan Jetstar can provide good food that meets business class expectations. However the toasted sandwich and cookies main course has me questioning whether my next flight to Australia in August should be with another airline. Jetstar's weak point - it cannot sustain a basic standard the difference between the two flight experiences was huge. Conversely its cabin staff and check-in staff have shown tangible improvement with courtesy and efficiency.",1
My much anticipated first flight on the Dreamliner turned out to be a bit of a disaster. My wife and I flew from Melbourne to Bangkok in economy. The entertainment system which we had pre booked did not work for either of us the screen had completely frozen and despite the best efforts of the crew to restart it numerous times it just would not go. Amazingly for such a new plane we were not the only one on the flight with this problem. The way JetStar have designed their entertainment unit is if it's unresponsive like ours were not only do you not get video but you cannot turn on the overhead light or call an attendant. It's all integrated in with each other. Due to the Dreamliner windows automatically shading out while mid flight we had to sit there in the dark with no entertainment or reading. Let me tell you it was a long 8 hour flight. I only picked JetStar for the Dreamliner experience. Never again.,1
"I checked in at counter with two of luggages, one of them is golf bag (11kg). All total weight was 20kg , which is under the limit. But the girl at counter use her mobile to check all the rules then told me that my golf bag is sport equipment, which incured a extra fee. Told her taht I've been travelling with that golf bag around Asia,no airlines charge fees. Even AirAsia didn't charge me when I flight from Singapore to Penang. She insisted and ask her supervisor, the guy even didn't listen at all and said 'She is doing her job.' To avoid to delaying the people behind me, I paid $140 extra for that golf bag.",1
"Bangkok to Tokyo. Most horrible airline, worst customer service. Tried to pay my baggage online and the web page wasnt working properly. They charge me almost $80 when I checked in, none of the people working in the counter were able to facilitate the way of payment. Flying with this airline is as nasty as flying with Spirit, RyanAir etc. They will have you pay in any way they will find. Will never fly with this company again.",1
MNL-TAG short hall domestic flight with 8 people including infants. Flight was a bit late but was a nice Airbus jet and was OK. Very good fare except they nickel and dime you for everything and they have no advanced boarding for families with infants.,0
"Unfortunately we bought a couple of Cebu Pacific flights when we were travelling in the Philippines and it is a nightmare. Flights are late (3 to 4 hours is normal), many of them cancelled, they re-route passengers to other airports and then send you by bus to your destination. Just madness after madness. This is not a serious airline.",1
"I booked & paid to fly KL to Manila in May 2020. AirAsia cancelled (Covid)  so i started the refund process. This was difficult but eventually i got a human who gave me a case no. and a promise!! 11 months late after many emails promising that my case has been 'validated' or 'upgraded'. I am still waiting for my money back. The case no. has changed (upgraded) but was then closed with no refund, no explanation. The chat bot is a complete waste of electrons - just goes around in circles (designed like this of course).",1
"They deserve the title of best LLC in SE Asia. They have been doing this a long time, and still they are the best value for money with the best routes.",0
"I will never take AirAsia again if there is a choice. Worst ever airlines I have ever experienced. They rescheduled my flight and changed me and my kids' seating from first row (hot seat) to a normal seat in the back row. And there is no refund for this change. I tried to chat in Airasia App multiple times but the only response I got was 'we are experiencing technical issue, please try again later.' It is really frustrating when the planned schedule was simply changed by AirAsia and the seat row (I bought first seat for the comfort of me and my kids as I was travelling without husband) was changed to normal seat. And is there is no refund for this row change.",1
"Chennai to Goa. My mother of 88 years and myself travelled yesterday morning by 6E128. The wheel chair attendant of my mother in IndiGo forgot to bring along her Walking Stick after the Security check. We came to know of this after boarding the aircraft. I complained on arrival in Goa and it is very inconvenient for her without the Walking Stick. We are extremely pleased with the excellent follow up by all concerned staff of IndiGo, and my mother is very happy to receive the Walking Stick today which was room delivered to us. We would like to share and record our sincere appreciation to all concerned staff of IndiGo.",0
"Denpasar to Berlin via Singapore. The worst customer service. I had purchased a roundtrip ticket to Berlin. Later when I noticed that the return flight was not matching with my connecting flight from Nice, I tried to make a change for the next day. When I saw that the change, all of a sudden had a 11 hour layover in Singapore, (unlike the original flight) I called customer service to cancel the return flight all together and purchase my return flight from a different airline. Yet I was still in the ""system"" . So when I arrived at the airport they would not let me check in unless I paid another $300 for a hypothetical change on a flight which I canceled. Then I was told to call customer service, even though I had been on the phone with them already for two days and they were unable to take the charge out of the 'system"". Truly outrageous. Do not use this airline.",1
"We traveled as a family of 4 from Taroko to Taipei for return flight to Singapore on Tue 19th Oct 2019. Due to the length of the journey and the numbers of transits we had to make, we were unfortunately slightly late at check in - just before 3pm, 5min late to be precise. The ground staff refused to let us check in and offered no help and advice on the return options. The male staff who claimed to be the supervisor in charge has the worse possible service attitude - he was aggressive and unpleasant. He is the worst service staff I have come across in a very long time. Its not clear whether he is an employee of Scoot or belongs to a contracting company. In either case he should be replaced because he is a very negative representation of Scoot in Taiwan.",1
I with my wife travelled from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur on 5th Nov 2013 and from KL to Adelaide on 9th Nov 2013. Both the flights were comfortable and enjoyed journey.,0
"First experience of Boeing 787 with Scoot on Singapore Bangkok round trip. While Scoot is low cost airline, the aircraft was brand new Boeing 787 and seats were quite comfortable. Routine flight, but one can sense that you are flying on higher altitude than usual (it was 42000ft). Okay service, no delay - was actually a good experience. Plus the aircraft is able to contact to WiFi.",0
"I travelled Cochin to Chennai. One of the best parts of flying in Indigo is the timing, always on time. The cabin crews was well trained and pleasant,  I truly like the ambience and the behaviour of the cabin crew. All i want to say is try Indigo airline and you will feel the difference.",0
"Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur on August 27, slightly delayed due to congestion at night. Onboard found only one FA was friendly and enjoyed her work, and after meal service crew disappear until prior landing announcement. The seat pitch at seat 23E is generous. Choose to fly with AirAsia because their schedule time is convenient compared to others. Broadly this was a good flight.",0
Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast. It was a great flight and very comfortable. The flight was not full and I had three seats to myself. I like the Gold Coast airport a lot and it is very small so customs and immigration is very fast.,0
"Firstly, this was my first time trying Jetstar after years of being a loyal flyer on Air New Zealand. I would outright recommend Jetstar to anyone, even though their service isn't as comprehensive or fulfilling, they are a pleasure to fly on. My flight left early by about 5 mins. We were kept informed throughout the flight of progress. My seat was great (1F), and if you can, choose this seat or any others in row 1. For the price of this flight they are miles ahead of Air New Zealand. Will fly again.",0
"Miri to Kuala Lumpur. I frequently used AirAsia since 2010 until now. You will get what you pay. You cannot expect first class service with the price of a few dollars. I very much like its Nasi Lemak. The ground service is good. For once, I accidently left my wallet under my seat. The flight already departed to another place. Luckily me, the staff found my wallet and keep it for me.",0
"Denpasar to Melbourne. When boarding our flight we found that the seat (extra legroom) were not available. We advised the crew that the seats we had booked and paid for 6 months ago were not the seats we had been allocated. After a lot of running around we were told that the flight had been oversold and that we had two options. Get off this flight and try to find our own flight with extra leg room seats. Sit in the seats we have been allocated, not extra leg room okay so you will hold this plane while our luggage is unloaded. No was the answer. Just take your seats you are holding this flight up. We sat in the seats allocated not the seats paid for. We were told that we would be contacted by someone from customer services within 24 hrs. No that didn't happen. We spoke to Jess via a chat, nothing they can do We took a trip out to the airport today to Jetstar customer service and spoke to a very abrupt man who told us there was nothing he could do. No one can help, no communication with Jetstar for a complaint just speak to a computer chat line. Whilst on the flight we were ignored by the staff and not even offered a cup of coffee. We book the extra leg room seats for a reason, why not contact us before boarding and offer another flight if they had oversold them. I cant believe that business can treat customers like this it is an disgrace.",1
Bangkok to Osaka via Singapore. Worst ever. Flight information notifications confusing and misleading. We knew that no free meals would be provided but were astonished to be told that passengers cannot consume any food or beverages they bring to the plane. Not even drinking water is provided unless you pay. Was told that the planes used to have water fountains but they were removed. How mean is that! Our decision: never again!.,1
"Worst customer service. ! I am travelling with my family to Gensan, 6 of us. We were there 3hours before the flight. We didnt get into the plane. A night before I was trying to add extra luggage in Cebu pacific online site. It didn't go through I was getting an error. So we went to the airport with our hand carry alone. And when we got to the airport it says it went through. So we need to pay even though we dont have the extra luggage. We end up paying, line was long at the cashier. We went back to check in and the stuffs told us that check was close. We need to rebook our ticket. If the staff just try to help this will never happened. However they didnt care at all.",1
"Dubai to Goa via Mumbai. Passengers had to wait for 12hrs to reach in Dubai, due to technical issues they said and landed In Oman, but didnt give a proper space to freshen up or to rest and havent provided and facilities and after reaching at Mumbai at 1am they asked to wait 12 more hours to wait to catch the connection flight to goa without giving a space to rest. No proper meal also provided. It was 7.5hrs total flying time instead it took 30hrs.",1
"Jetstar provided an excellent low-cost service from Melbourne to Hobart. A departure time of 0605 ensures that approximately half of the passengers fall asleep before the aircraft leaves the ground. Thus inflight service is quick and efficient. I purchased seat 1D for $11 because I needed to exit the aircraft ASAP. The downside was that nearly every passenger swiped my head with their shoulder bag whilst boarding. I won't do this again in a hurry. The flight departed on time and arrived early. The passengers are the problem. A pleasant request to ""return tray tables to the upright position"", is not rocket science. Jetstar is doing an excellent execution of affable LCC operations.",0
"Cebu Pacific, Economy, MNL-SYD. On time takeoff. Very expensive food if not pre-booked. Seats are narrow with poor recline. Budget airline so price was ok, but not as cheap as they used to be. Not sure if I would use them again.",0
The only positive I can find about this airline is the time given to you as a result of their constant delays and cancellations is the time to write a review about them. I was not aware of the recent issues this airline was having in the Philippines.Unfortunately this airline issues have been overlooked by the Countries Avaition Authority so better to avoid until there is a change in attitude and they show more concern towards the People who decide to visit this incredible country and its local people. In one of my situations a 1 hour flight between 2 airports resulted in a 12 hour flight across 3 airports. Dont spoil you holidays and look for alternative airlines.,1
"My daughter and I took the flight on 24th May, at 6am, heading to Taipei from Singapore. The flight was very full. The seat that I sat on was broken as it could not recline. I informed your air stewardess, who then tried to make the seat work but failed. She informed her colleague, an air steward, who came over to check the situation. He offered to change our seats to a functioning one. After he went to look for vacant seats, he came back and told us that there were no two empty seats available together but that there were unoccupied ones in the quiet zone. He was very helpful and led us to the quiet zone and helped relocate our heavy luggage overhead. His attitude was sincere and indicated a willingness to help and I was very grateful for his service.",0
"For as much as I wish this was a positive letter about our experience with Air Asia, this is far from positive. And if I was able to give this airline a ZERO, I would. Plus this letter is written in behalf of my whole family of 18 who traveled to enjoy our trip to Palawan. On the morning of Sunday, April 23rd 2023, my sister in law pre-checked all of us in online prior to our arrival to the airport which she received an email confirming this check in to show at the counter. At approximately 1130 my family of 18 (included in this number was 7 children) of us traveling arrived at the Palawan Puerto Princesa Airport which was 3 hours prior to our departure back to Cebu Philippines which was around 1430, like everybody is instructed to do before every departure. At the time, they started calling for all passengers to check in their luggage for our flight, we arrived at the counter and my sister in law showed her our pre check in confirmation email. It was an overwhelming experience to our family. The policies and procedure were never clear. As the parting answer of the Manager, that the Pre-checked in option is never a guarantee that you will have a seat. My family and I took a 3 night trip to Palawan from Cebu. I, personally have traveled on numerous different airlines and never have I noticed so much unprofessionalism. And such a disappointment to most of my family members which was their first time ever being on a plane. Even though we had so much of a bad experience with Air Asia there is one police officer that show so much compassion, especially to my wife and sister in law, who were forced to stay back till they found another flight. Never again will we fly Air Asia.",1
"Flew Kochi to Hyderabad. Worst customer service ever experienced. Flight got delayed for 3 hours and delay was notified after the actual departure time by SMS. When I checked with the AirAsia desk about the delay, they didn't even seem to know that the flight was delayed 3 hours. I dont want to travel with AirAsia again.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. Extremely frustrated, worst airline ever. The flight was cancelled 4 minutes before the departure time due to weather in Melbourne while my friend just arrived in Melbourne 2 hours earlier and was shocked to hear weather issue in Melbourne when the weather there was pretty good. While I had to wait in the queue for an hour to see any flight options, I already saw online there was no more flight available that night. I already paid for the hotel in Melbourne and couldnt change. After confirming with the staff in check-in counter, I could only book the flight at 6 am the next morning and was also told I wouldnt get any compensation for hotel or train cost because it was weather issue, not Jetstars responsibility. I had to return home and left home at 4 am to the airport for the flight at 6 am. After I came back, I tried to complain and request for compensation for the hotel. I hadnt found an email address and could only submit my hotel receipt and train record via an online form and complained to a machine in a chat window who showed no human emotion and just said it was weather and there was nothing they could do. They dont have Toll free number and the phone number charges apply. They simply refused to take any responsibility or even listen with a human ear. I will never fly with Jetstar again.",1
"A superlative experience. Flew Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata with IndiGo. Waited at the baggage carousel (very short wait). Had checked in two items: a bag and a long cardboard tube containing prints. The former arrived at the carousel; the latter did not. Enquired from IndiGo staff attending at and they informed me that since the tube was marked 'fragile' it would arrive separately very shortly (which it did) and asked me if I was connecting to an IndiGo flight and on my answering, yes, I was, IndiGo said they will assign staff member to escort me and my luggage to domestic departures. A lady took charge of me and my luggage - she insisted on pushing my trolley, I insisted on doing it myself; I won - and took me all the way to IndiGo x-ray security. As I was carrying a bottle of duty-fee liquor in my carry on, and since liquor cannot be carried on domestic flights, I checked my back pack through x-ray and the IndiGo staff, to avoid bottle smashing, tied my backpack up very securely and put a fragile tag on it and asked the staff escorting me to inform IndiGo check in counter, where the pack was specially tagged and given to a baggage handler to carry it personally into the baggage room. A superb experience!",0
"You literally can expect to be always delayed with Lion Air. When its not, its going to surprise you like never before. I understand that this is a low cost airline, but Lion Airs fare is far from low cost. It costs a minimum 50 to fly 1.5h from Jakarta to Denpasar.  I need to arrive 2h before my flight but Id have to wait for this airline to ruin my day?  I know sometimes its inevitable as Lion Air serves routes that other airlines dont, but oh my goodness, its just not worth it.",1
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Flight delayed for more than 1.5 hours and this is not the first time. Even now I am sitting at Jakarta airport my flight to KLIA suppose to be at 2100 delayed. Lion Air management should take neccesary action to avoid this situation in future. The worst flight.,1
Perth to Bali. Got all the way to the departure lounge today seeing there was a delay. Not long after told over the PA that the flight was cancelled and to make our way to luggage claim and then back to check in counter for options. Massive queue lining up for hours only to be told they could not do anything but advise us to ring their number.,1
Return flight from Bangkok to Udon Thanni. The four members of staff at boarding gate were either sleeping or playing with their phones. None took any interest in the customers despite the flight boarding time coming and going with no announcements. On the return flight 5 days later the cabin crew failed to notice 3 extremely drunk passengers who I guess were automatically allocated online emergency exit seats! When I told the cabin crew about this they asked them to move and one of the crew later thanks me. I sat in one of the emergency exit seats and was given no extra information which was unusual as every time prior when seated on such seats the staff took the trouble to make sure I was familiar with how to open the door in the very unlikely event of an emergency.,1
The flight was half empty and we were all seated together 3 persons 6 persons per row. We politely asked if we could change seat in order to get more space and make everyone happy but the flight attendant was very rude to us and refused for anybody to switch seats.,1
My flight was cancelled and I processed a refund. Never got the money back despite contacting the Customer Service. It's impossible to contact them in other ways.,1
"Scoot is not the airline for those who has mobility issues and needs a wheel chair. They made me wait forever, because i did not want to miss my flight, i had to walk to the far away gate.",1
"Due to fly Cebu to Manila. Fly Cebu Pacific only if you have all the time in the world. As I speak, we have been delayed 3 hours and are expected to be delayed for more than 4 hours. If you have connections or value your time, fly Philippine Airlines instead. People have been asking Cebu Pacific to review their operations for many years now (they bump off groups at will also even if the flight was not cancelled, they've recently done it for an upcomimg international trip just last week) but they've not improved. Very much a budget airline operating in a near monopoly market. Avoid if your budget permits.",1
"Cairns to Sydney. I arrived at check in as per normal, as a musician I was travelling with my guitar alongside my bandmates, who also had guitars. We had already booked a lot of very expensive extra baggage. when two of us arrived the airline check-in staff told us we had to pay an extra $25 per guitar as a fee for oversize baggage. I was offended as this is an obvious money making exercise on behalf of jetstar and I travel frequently with many airlines and over 20 years with a guitar have never been asked for this before, oversize baggage handling is a very minimal service which mostly involves the passenger taking the bags to a different conveyor. The ground staff argued with me trying to tell me that it was always the case and that other airlines charge the same amount. When my bandmate arrived to check in with the same booking, he wasnt charged any extra fee they didnt even mention it. When i made a complaint I just got the run-around.",1
"I will never fly with Jetstar again. They moved my flight without telling me then when I called customer service they yelled at me. Flights delayed a day, then another day, then an hour, then another 15 at the airport. They took away my checked baggage when they changed my flight and wouldn't reinstate it. Then they quoted me $17 per 10kg, then when i got to the service desk in the airport they charged either $50 for an extra 7kg of carry on or $45 for 15kg of checked baggage. When going through TSA I was scanned, asked to take my shoes off, even though I had previously asked the TSA if I had to, they said no. Took my shoes off and was body scanned again, then was accused of hiding something in my armpit!? In the 2 minutes it took me to take my shoes off and put on the conveyer line? They kept insisting I should go somewhere private for it, but I had nothing to hide and they were only making me late for my flight (all good though, cos it was delayed again). Nothing came up in the search, obviously. They then pulled my bag aside to pull apart then decided they wouldn't. Flight delayed again. Each time another delay I failed to get an email to update me of the change. A friend caught a Jetstar flight the same day and they delayed her flight twice, even while on the plane, and the staff misprinted 3 passengers tickets so they had to reprint their tickets while they waited.  I have had to spend an extra 410 on a flight I originally booked weeks and weeks ago (I even had insurance but they refused to refund me). Incredibly disappointed and enraged by the service.",1
CGK-HKT. The flights were on time aircraft very clean and well-maintained and service was very friendly and professional. I paid a small supplement for one of the 'hotseats' and it was well worth it. The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket. Their regular fares are often only a bit cheaper than other carriers.,0
"Singapore to Jakarta. The airline entered my name twice on the ticket and upon calling them they kept on asking me to ring another number, noting that not all were local numbers. At one stage I was on hold for 45min (international) before I spoke to a person and then they hung up on me! In the end they charged my $32 for removing the duplicate name from my ticket. The worst customer service I have ever experienced!",1
We flew with Jetstar last week and it was the worst flight I have taken. We were coming home from Phuket arrived at the airport to be told our flight was canceled! No email no SMS letting us know. We flew to Singapore (which was scheduled). To be passed from one queue to another where no one seemed to know what was going on. To cut a long story short it took us 30 hrs to get home to Melbourne via Perth (with a further 3hr wait) to eventually be put on a Qantas flight. Do yourself a favour and do not fly internationally with Jetstar.,1
"I had booked ticket from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur return. While going they allowed to check in baggage of 20 kg, on my return they said that I had not opted for check in baggage and you have to pay 100 Mal $ to checkin the baggage.  Finally I had to pay extra for check in my luggage to return back India.",1
"Flew Jetstar from Sydney to Adelaide and return. Departed Sydney twenty minutes late and arrived in Adelaide 15 minutes behind schedule. The return was worse as we departed Adelaide thirty minutes late and arrived in Sydney twenty-five minutes late. While the return flight was late after delays in Melbourne because of the weather, it is still unacceptable. Jetstar needs to lift its game or re-schedule flights further apart to regain punctuality. On the plus side, I asked for aisle seats for both legs at check in and was accommodated with no fuss and a big smile.",0
"Rarotonga to Auckland with Jetstar. Most unorganised set up to ever exist. Haven't flown with them in years because it's always a bad experience, but had not choice on dates and times this time around. No surprise Jetstar still manages to stuff it all up. Late departure because of paperwork problems, then even later departure because they managed to double booked seats on the plane. Simple things they can't get right. I'd rather break my leg than deal with this outfit again.",1
"I was late for the return flight to Jakarta, but staff let me board at the gate. The Flight is only 1.40 hours, so I don't need IFE or a meal, maybe a free mineral water would add more value to LCC flights. My first LCC flight was not bad, actually very good value for money.",0
Bangalore to Mumbai. I was not feeling well and air hostess provided me as much help as she can during my  journey. I am very much impressed with this behavior of staff towards passengers and I will be a frequent flyer of indigo. Thanks Indigo for choosing such a helpful and lovely staff,0
"Encountered very rude ground staff. This is a first for me and it was shocking to see such behavior. We were a total of 5 passengers travelling together (2 senior citizens and 1 child) and had cabin luggage of 7kgs each. As we had a kid and 2 senior citizens travelling, just one of the baggages was exceeding 7kgs out of the total 4 bags we were carrying. The way the matter was handled was very unprofessional and disappointing. Will always try to skip this airlines if I have an option.",1
"Yet again, Jetstar Airways excel in the skies. I cannot rate this airline highly enough. However, Jetstar fall completely on their face when it comes to attitude, competency and efficiency in relation to their ground-based passenger service. I had a six hour connection time in Melbourne. Arriving from Hobart at 1800, check-in for my Christchurch flight did not open until 2045. I was unable to access a charging point for my laptop, without being processed by a security check point. That meant I would have had to dispose of a few items packed in my checked luggage. (I was not able to check my bag through from HBA to CHC). When check-in for my flight finally opened, I found that I was slightly over the carry-on weight limit. This meant packing my laptop and charger in my 20kg allowance. Thus no laptop or charger to use while waiting for departure. At self check-in, the JQ system could only recognise me on a flight which would take me to the wrong destination. As directed, I approached a check-in agent, weaving my way through many JQ staff who seemed intent on chatting with one another, and ignoring passengers. The rudeness intensified with the agent I chose. Obviously someone who had experienced an unpleasant day, and also someone who made it quite obvious that he or she did not want to be there. Once in the departure lounge, things changed completely, and the excellent Jetstar service returned, even to the point of an offer of changing seats into an exit row in the aircraft. I graciously accepted, and thoroughly enjoyed the flight right through to my destination. A minor hiccup, but an unnecessary one, this will not deter me from flying with JQ. I still highly recommend this airline.",0
"Singapore to Ipoh. Having read preceding reviews (and other friends experiences), I booked Scoot with fear and trepidation. However, as one of the few airlines flying this sector, and as it was a short flight, I decided to take the risk. Buying online was uncomplicated, but I did feel the additional fees for payment (credit card, NETS, AXS) were a little high - I know budget airlines charge for everything, but surely the administrative costs for payment are not that high. Check-in at the kiosk was uncomplicated, I didn't pay for luggage so headed straight for departure. Boarding was supposed to be by seat row number but it basically looked like everyone just headed in, so I did the same. Aircrew were pleasant enough but not terribly enthusiastic, though safety checks were done professionally. Seat pitch on this A320-200 was adequate, but I felt the seat cushions were a little less comfortable than on other airlines: adequate for the 1 hour hop, but perhaps less so if it were going to be longer than that. I bought no additional services, so didn't expect anything else. Arrival was on time and disembarkation was uncomplicated. In total, a simple flight that left on time and arrived on time. Other than the relentlessly cheery branding ""Scoot!"", the overall experience was good!",0
"This is about the 4th time I have flown Jetstar star class. If you know what to expect then you will be happy. If you want lie flat beds and all the trimmings then you are kidding yourself. My flight on May 10 from Melbourne to Bangkok was great. Check in staff were grumpy, but I got over that. The seats are comfortable enough for a daytime flight with plenty of legroom, just not much recline. The food was good, not up to some airlines business class but not too far off it. Wine selection and quality was good. The Thai staff were very good. The cabin is only 3 rows for star class, smaller than I have had in the past, but that is good as you get better service and no queueing for the toilet. We were first on and first off the plane. Qantas Lounge in Melbourne is okay, but needs a refresh, a bit tired compared to say Singapore or Hong Kong, or even Los Angeles. Overall I think it is a good deal and an alternative to Qantas premium economy, which I would rate about the same, which makes sense as the cost is similar for routes of the same length.",0
"Singapore to Perth and impressed. The flight was delayed a little but left not too far behind time and was only 20 minutes late into Perth. The seat in Scootbiz (4A/C) was equal to Qantas domestic business class less the seatback video which Qantas  has on most services. We had a drink and meal included in the price and the service wasn't that far off a legacy carrier. For the just under five hours run down to Perth, Scootbiz, at a third of the price of Qantas, wasn't too far off the pace. Service was very good from a hard working crew and while it wasn't what we'd experienced in Business with Qatar Airways on the four previous legs, it was a fraction of the price. Very professional service for the price.",0
Traveling from Tiruchirapalli to Guwahati was a good experience. It all started with which the services of Ground staff Sakthipriya T (Indigo) whose politeness and overall demeanour is highly appreciable.,0
A regular flyer between MNL and PVG-KIK. Check-in can be a little chaotic at NIAA. Aircraft fleet is very new mixture of A319/320. Flights often leave late from MNL but arrive early at their destination. I take an average of 10 flights a year and find them value for money compared to the national carriers.,0
The worst airline I have been on. The main problem are the checkin procedures in Seoul which were pathetic. The staff would not let us put in 1 x 23 kg bag even though we paid for 2 x 14kg bags. Apparently it breaks the rules even though we technically paid 30% more doing it this way. They also made us take out 3kg and put in our hand luggage because of some random policy. They then make you wait for 5-10 minutes while they check your bag for some unknown reason. None of it makes sense and is totally out of line with every other airline process globally. Avoid at all costs.,1
"Absolutely the worst airline to deal with! Our flights were cancelled in March due to COVID-19. I requested a refund, and on 18/03/2020 was told my refund was processed and my money would be returned within 10-15 calendar days. 8 months later and I havent received a penny! I was then emailed in May to say I could have a credit account! Replied saying are you having a laugh! No thank you! Since then I have messaged every other day via their Twitter account as this is the only way I can contact them. No phone number, no email address an infuriating automated system that tells you nothing and solves nothing. Each time I am told that my refund is in the final stage and will be back in my account shortly and nothing appears! I am a nurse in the UK and was due to go and see my dad who lives in Manila with my family. Its bad enough that our 3 week holiday was cancelled, this is just rubbing salt in the wound! 500 of my hard earned money that they were quick enough to take is still not back with me! I couldnt be angrier. Their customer service is seriously sub standard and I would not recommend anyone to use this company! Modern day robbery at its finest. Would be giving 0/10 if allowed, but has to begrudgingly be a 1/10! Seriously, avoid this company like the plague.",1
The baggage checked-in was a big mess and everything went in chaos. We waited for around 1 h in the line and they did not even apologize. They lost my luggage and I have to wait to see if they can locate it. In case they wouldn't be able to find my luggage they will not pay me anything unless I provide them receipts. How can I find all the receipts.,1
"My friend and I booked a flight from Krabi Airport to Bangkok for a very good price with Lion Air subsidiary Thai Lion Air. Seen the mostly negative reviews of Lion Air itself and were a bit hesitant to fly, but figured it would probably be alright. The experience was actually better than I expected. Yes, we did have one of Lion Air's notorious delays (about 25 minutes) and no, they did not mention it nor apologize. However, the flight itself was allright. Seats and legroom are comparable to other low-cost airlines and we comfortable enough for me (I'm just under 1.80 m). Staff are friendly and in-flight food and drinks are inexpensive. I don't know anything about the quality since I only had tea. Overall, I can say that if you don't mind a little delay, Thai Lion Air can be a good budget-concious choice.",0
"I was due to fly Gold Coast to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur on 12th March but received an SMS and email stating the flight had been cancelled. To get through to a human is a long drawn out affair repeating the same question to a  robot and then the same again when the before they connect you to the live chat and then again once they actually come on line after 45 mins or so.. They cancelled the second leg to Phuket and there are now no longer same day connections and you have a 16 hour stopover in KL instead. I booked the flight 6 months ago for a great price, now 3 weeks out they cancel without the decency to offer to put you up in a hotel in KL.  The only offer I get is of a refund or credit and I now have no alternative than to fly from the Gold coast to Sydney and then book a new flight at a total cost of $800 due to the departure date being so near. I have been cut off from the live chat 3 times and the managers are just rude. I an airline mess up they should be held accountable and offer some sort of compensation.",1
I was flying Jetstar domestically from Adelaide to Brisbane and I only had carry on bags. My bag was only slightly overweight and not only did they make me check my bag in but they charged me an extra fee of $70 despite the fact that I didn't have $70 at the time.,1
Ahmedabad to Pune on Indigo. Check in was easy fast and efficient. Clean plane with good service and a very friendly crew. On time and value for money.,0
"Haikou to Singapore. Was on the flight returning to Singapore and was fortunate to have an attentive flight attendant who went extra mile to care for the passengers on board. Scoot, a budget airline but you do not get budget service.",0
"Doha to Kochi. The check in staff were unprofessional and impolite. I had an excess baggage of 5kg which I took back and repacked without any hesitation, Yet they behaved as if I was handling drugs. I took back only one baggage to repack, leaving the other to them to check in. Coming back after repacking which is a struggle at the airport , these check in staff kept yelling why I kept the bag there.",1
"I had to cancel my original AirAsia flight having just missed my connection through my own fault. The staff at check in did all they could to get me to the gate but I was way too late. The services counter staff were very helpful and I got a replacement ticket for the next day, it cost more of course but the staff were very friendly and offered a number of options, not just the next flight, they also offered advice on accommodation options to returning to Kuala Lumpur for the night which would have worked out cheaper for me had I taken them up on the offer. AirAsia offer a far superior service than some other low cost airlines such as Jetstar.  ( World's Best Low-Cost Airline)",0
"My recent experience with Cebu Pacific Air was nothing short of a nightmare. They lost my luggage and left me without my belongings for an entire month during my holiday. They failed to follow proper procedures when I reported my lost luggage, showing a complete lack of care and professionalism. To make matters worse, they made the compensation process a convoluted and frustrating ordeal, and to this day, I've received no compensation. Their customer service is shockingly bad, and it feels like they want customers to give up and accept their negligence. Cebu Pacific Air may be a budget airline, but their cost-cutting measures come at the expense of customer satisfaction. I will never travel with them again. If you value your peace of mind, consider better options and steer clear of this airline.",1
"I will be flying Air Asia at the end of this month from Perth to Bali. I just found out that I will need to fly straight to Melbourne from Bali for work reasons and won't have time to fly home to Perth. However, Air Asia does not allow for a change of flight destination, meaning I have to book an entirely new flight. I would understand the expectation to pay some kind of a fee for updating the flight destination, but the fact that they don't even offer it as an option is an extreme inconvenience.  Air Asia prevents you from changing flights is to force you into paying for an entirely new flight. I will be doing this as I have no other option, but I will certainly not be flying with Air Asia again.",1
"The flight was unfortunately delayed and T4 at Melbourne Airport is not particularly well designed to put it mildly. Still it was an enjoyable flight. The staff were friendly and well organised, given it was a full flight and the pre booked meal was quite tasty .as well. Overall, fine for a budget flight.",0
"On February 11, 2018 we traveled with ""Fly Scoot"" from Singapore to Chennai. From Chennai we had transfer to Sharja. Before checked (check-in) our tickets we understand to it have imposible this transfer (in Chennai) for us. he FlyScoot ground staff immediately helped us. They gave us all support both in airport in Singapoure and airport in Chennai. Without their help, we wouldn't have got home. The flight was on time, the service was at the top level - flight crew, food, WC-clean and hgih speed Wi-Fi. The seats were wide and comfortable. The plane was B787 Dreamliner - by my opinion the best plane on nowadays.",0
Singapore to Melbourne. I purchased onboard wifi for $35 (200MB) but internet wasnt working. When I got back home I contacted Scoot for a refund. Scoot customer service is worst I have  come across. Its been 2 weeks and they havent reimbursed the amount paid. Its so disgraceful that Scoot takes so long to settle such a straight forward issue where even the cabin stewardess lodged a complaint (for internet issues).,1
"On Monday 16 September I flew with Jetstar from Melbourne to Sydney ( flight JQ 520 ) The crew was unbelievable unfriendly. I was taking a video in front of the plane. Apparently thats dangerous, I didnt know. Instead of explaining me calmly she starts getting crazy and being super rude. She didnt greet me when I enter the plane. Sorry but is that your kinda service? I pay for a flight and dont want to get treated rude by staff. The staff on the ground treat you like a number? They weigh your bag before entering the plane - where is the trust? I really dont recommend this airline.",1
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Flight departed & arrived on time. Cabin crew were courteous but distant. Lucky enough to be sitting in an empty row although flight was more than half full. Short flight so nothing much more to add on.,0
"If you want endless frustration dealing with an AI instead of real customer service, then this might be the place for you. It is almost as if this company intentionally tries to make it difficult so they dont have to help you.",1
Singapore to Bali. The customer service and credit shell application process for Air Asia is terrible. I had to transfer two other airline bookings into a credit shell due to the CV19 situation and both took under two minutes to complete with confirmation coming a few days later. I have tried countless times to contact AirAsia and with no success. Even the telephone line to India is an automated response and redirects you back to their AVA bot chat which is beyond useless. The credit shell process is both difficult and unclear. Extremely disappointing.,1
"Sydney to Honolulu. In short: Cheap flight that is not worth a penny. Ridiculous baggage restrictions with unreasonable extra costs, poor customer service, no complimentary drinks or snacks, no included meals for a 9 hr flight, and no in-flight entertainment. Jetstar ruined Christmas and was a terrible start to our holidays. My husband and I have been living abroad for a year now and we were really hoping to make it home for Christmas to see our families. Jetstar had a great price for flights, so we told our families we would be able to afford Christmas at home with them so long as they knew that we wouldn't be able to afford additional Christmas gifts. We each had 1 hiking backpack (to their low expectation of 30lbs per check-bag - which is 50lbs with every other airline), each had 2 small backpacks as a carry-on, and packed 2 suitcases of things we decided to fly home with us as we had accumulated quite a few things while living there on a Working Holiday Visa. We packed up a full suitcase filled with Australian treats - enough to fill a stocking for each of our siblings as well as our parents to thank each of them for hosting us while we were home for the holidays. I had prepaid for check-baggage prior to the flight - only to realize that the bags were limited to 30lbs, and that I wasn't able to purchase additional baggage (I assumed I'd be able to purchase these 2 additional bags once we arrived at the airport). I assumed wrong. We arrived at the airport with our pre-weighed carry-on backpacks and our 30lb check bags. I planned to pay the same steep rate of $115 per additional check-bag (of only 30lbs and not the regular 50lbs) once we got there, though while checking in, we were told that was not an option and that we would need to pay $25 per kg. We were quoted a total of $1300 for our additional bags. We paid $1400 ($700 each) for our flights, $230 for our pre-paid luggage, and then would have paid $1300 dollars extra to get 2 suitcases home - both at 50lbs. More than our flights! We stepped aside and sorted through our luggage to decide what we were able to bring home. We narrowed our bags down to 1 suitcase and packed it to 20 kilos. We were charged an additional $500 for 1 suitcase  to fly back home. A whole suitcase of Christmas gifts had to be thrown out as we could not afford to take it home to our families. We found a security guard, asked him if he had kids, and said Merry Christmas. I wish it had ended there. The lady checking us in couldn't put our payment through as her computer wasn't working. When she finally got us checked in, her payment terminal wasn't functioning. Once the payment was put through, we had to move over to someone else that then printed our boarding passes for us. She also told us that they weren't going to be able to get us a seat together -  the best part is that the plane was half empty - and the lady sitting a couple of rows up from us got to lay on the 4 seats in the middle on her own because her ankle was sore and she wanted to put her feet up. They didn't have complimentary drinks, no complimentary snacks, or meals for a 9 hr flight. On top of that, your only option for entertainment was to pay a $10 fee for in-flight entertainment as they didn't have any movies to show on the plane - and they couldn't even make the effort to get us a seat beside each other with half of the plane empty.",1
Jogjakarta to Banjarmasin. I arrived at the airport in around 9 o'clock in the morning and my flight should depart at 11.30  but it got delayed for an hour so we departed at around 12.30. Seat pocket was very dirty. Ac was turned off and it was very hot. Bad this time. At least the flight attendant smiled at me once.,1
Gold Coast to Auckland in January 2020. It was a very convenient flight as I did not have to transit through Sydney. I like to fly Jetstar whenever possible.,0
Just did return flights on Scoot from Gold coast to Singapore and it's value for money. No complaint from me and my family. Recommend to anyone looking for value for money.,0
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Refused to print the ticket for 2nd leg of trip at initial gate counter because tickets were bought at separate times. Flight was late but had plenty of time for transfer counter to print said booking closed 5mins ago. Won't do anything. Had to buy another ticket. It took about 7 mins to get to gate from transfer I had 50 minutes. All could have been avoided if they had printed ticket.,1
"Townsville to Melbourne via Sydney. The worst airline I have ever flown in. The seats are uncomfortable and no food is served unless paid for, and even then, they run out of almost everything before they travel to the fourth row. The air hostesses are not friendly or welcoming, except for 1 or 2. The flights were delayed. Its as if they think they are the best airline but they are so horrible; worse than flights in PNG, in my opinion, and those are bad as well. I never want to travel Jetstar again, they are the worst.",1
"We will never fly Jetstar again. Horrible experience and extremely poor customer service. Our flight got cancelled last minute while we were waiting to check in at the airport at noon. They only had a flight next day early morning. We were offered zero compensation, transportation and no accomodation. Staff very careless about it only excuses and stating ""it happens all the time"". It doesn't stop there - next day flight they put on 6.30 am we arrived several hours before and while checking in this was flight delayed again till 9am. Again no notification prior. So we've missed 2 days of our 5 day vacation, no compensation and no proper notifications so we could make other arrangments. Oh and they dont even include a bag for international flight either! (charged $75 for checking in 15kg bag!)  We've lost not only that but all the headache and expense of unrefundable hotels, activities and rental car, all because Jetstar didnt notify us before, cancels and delays flights last minute.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne short haul flight. Due to windy conditions only one runway was open in Melbourne, causing significant delays in the flight. Unfortunately, as a budget airline, flight was delayed for 90 minutes. My companion, who was flying a full-service Australian airline, was scheduled to leave later but arrived 30 minutes earlier than my flight. Goes to show that the pecking order is very different if you are flying budget! The flight itself was just okay - seats are uncomfortably tight (and I am not a tall or big person) and barely acceptable for a short flight. Service was reasonable and staff are not too draconian with luggage. Boarding was somewhat chaotic.",1
Sincere thanks to wonderful staff at the Sunshine Coast airport and T4 Terminal at Tullamarine Airport on 13th February. I badly sprained my ankle and would not have been able to return home without their assistance. They did everything to make my return home as comfortable as possible. Their assistance was given willingly and cheerfully. Thanks again to these wonderful staff.,0
"Terrible experience at Cebu Pacific. No hotel accomodation for affected passengers on this diverted flight. We are all tired from waiting more than 8 hours now here at Brunei Airport. We got no choice but to rest at the gates itself. Sequence of this nightmare experience: 10:00pm departed Manila and supposed to arrive Singapore past 1am 1.45am Announcement of Emergency Descent 2.30am rerouted to Brunei airport 2.30am til 5am waited inside the aircraft! 6am asked to deplane! No supporting docs for those affected passengers who may not be able to go to work in Singapore due to the delay! 6.20am queued for the breakfast! Minimal ground staff assistance, we cant find them! Flight crews promised that ground staff will assist us upon deplaning but there were not in sight!!! We are clueless where to go. We found the gate by ourselves 9.30am current time but no further updates from anyone here",1
Melbourne to Phuket new dreamliner. As soon as I walked onto the dreamliner I wanted to get off the seat pitch and size of the seats was so tight. I could find nothing positive about this new aircraft maybe a little quieter. Ready for take off pushed backed then stopped captain said it would only be ten minutes turned out to be almost two hours sitting on the plane before take off. Return flight one hour late in taking off. Thank goodness they changed the aircraft from the 787 to the airbus (more room). All up I would not choose to fly the 787 again for any thing more 5 hours due to fact of bad leg room and small seats.,1
"Flight was cancelled due to the Bali volcano situation. My flight was several days after the 1st sign of eruption, no updates were provided on the potential cancellation. I was notified a few hours prior to the departure. No proper communication on how to seek refunds. I had to do my own research to find out how to get the refund. After I made the submission, I had to contact them more than 4 times in the past 21 days with no updates. On 3 out of the 4 occasions, the customer service staff I chatted to ended the conversation abruptly without a conclusion. To hang up while someone is talking is very unprofessional. Their website couldn't find my refund status record too. During the Bali volcano eruption period, Jetstar offered their affected customers an alternative flight to another Jetstar destination.  AirAsia was silent throughout this period.",1
Cebu Pacific flight 150 on 28/1/2016 at 07.05. The only flight that was not cancelled of the three booked with Cebu Pacific in January 2016. Check in was quick with efficient staff. Fast boarding and departing on time. Aircraft clean with efficient staff. Seat a little bit small for people taller than 180cm.,1
Twice delayed for departure with no certainty it will depart. The same flight was cancelled yesterday. No explanation not even an apology. Disappointing customer service.,1
Returned from Hobart Sunday 6/7 on the 10.30am flight. Stood in a queue for more than 50 minutes to get bags checked in. This is very poor service Jetstar.,1
My 75 yo father flew Jetstar domestic Adelaide to Melbourne. I arranged this flight for him online as he is blind. At the Jetstar check-in Adelaide he was charged $70 for having a near empty cabin bag that was only 4cm over length. Technically a breach of cabin baggage dimensions but he was not aware of this. Took all his spare cash to pay it so he had no cash to pay for a taxi at Melbourne airport. He is unable to use an ATM. He explained all this no consideration given no assistance offered. The attitude was take it or leave it. Will never fly them again.,1
"I was supposed to travel on 14/05/2023, from Brisbane to Adelaide. I got a message on 14th May morning unexpectedly stating the above flight has been cancelled.  I made a call to the customer center requesting any flight to reach Adelaide by Sunday night or Monday morning as to get into my work on Monday. My friend who travelled with me had the same issues as well. But Jetstar could not provide me with a proper solution to tackle the above situation. So I was forced to take another available flight by myself suddenly and had to pay an extra amount. I am disappointed with the service provided.",1
"Every time we fly with Jetstar, it is almost expected that flights will be delayed. On our most recent trip to Japan, both inbound and outbound were delayed. We stopped at Cairns for a connecting flight and the staff pulled us in to reweigh our bags when we had already weighed them with no issues leaving Japan and even after checking in at the Cairns check-in counter. They made me open my bags in front of everyone, I had to pull out some clothes to wear. They then noticed my partner was with me and made her weigh her bags too. In the end, they made us pay $65 each. The ironic thing is that we flew from Japan with no dramas, same airline. Our bags already had the carry on tags which even the Jetstar staff let people through when they saw these tags on peoples carry ons as they walked in. I guess we were just unfortunate as we were singled out and made an example of. Safe to say this will be the last time we will fly with this atrocious airline. We rather pay that little extra to fly with a flagship airline, at least they provide in-flight meals, fly direct, and you don't have to buy your luggage, which is probably how Jetstar lures people in with their so called ""cheap fares"". I'll be sure to let all my friends and family know not to fly with these money hungry, poor serviced airline. Definitely not worth flying with.",1
"The worst flight! Of course was delayed! There was an accident with one of the passengers, help was provided late and because AirAsia are not providing stickers with the passenger details to the bags etc.. it took another 30-40 mins to find the bag of the passenger that was removed from the flight. Everyone was shocked and panicked, when I requested water after an accident it wasnt provided, you have to buy it! Just ridiculous! Flight was 3 hours + and with all the delays we were in the airplane for more than 4-5 hours! Customer service is as low as it could be. Not talking about how uncomfortable and tight the seats was.",1
"Return flights from Tokyo to Cairns were both very impressive. Flights were not crowded, which always helps, but found these nice new dreamliner aircraft to be very comfortable. Service was excellent, both friendly and efficient. I had not pre-purchased food or drinks, in fact, took my own food. But found a very good selection of both drinks and snacks available for purchase on the aircraft. Both flights departed right on time, and arrived a little early. All in all, and excellent experience.",0
"AirAsia you owe me money. In January 2019 I purchased six tickets from Manila to Cebu and back. When I arrived in Manila, March 2019 you canceled our flights. I have been 2 years trying to get my money back. I have gone through everything that you wanted me to. I have given you all of the information and I have contacted you hundreds of times. I have had conversations with your useless staff. I have given you bank account information to deposit the money that you took within minutes when I purchased the ticket and yet you cannot give me a refund. I have photographs of all of these conversations as well as a photograph of the policy that you had when I purchased my tickets. And that is that if you canceled my flight I was entitled to a full refund to the exact form of payment used to buy the tickets. I have pictures of your agent saying that I should have a refund. You cheat people out of their hard-earned money. We purchased our tickets in good faith and you did not provide the service. There are thousands like me.",1
"Delhi to Goa, and I flew three times with IndiGo. The planes are new and clean, and staff very professional. Seats are large and comfortable. The pilots communicate well with the passengers. Flights were on time. They have shuttle buses which bring you to the plane. Check-in was fast and smooth, and you can bring along 2 check-in bags with no extra charge. I was very impressed as I was not sure what to expect.",0
I was pleasantly surprised by the efficient and extremely helpful ground staff of Indigo Airlines counter at Bangalore airport this afternoon (we flew the BLR-Kannaur flight). We had difficulty with our luggage allowances and they helped us figure it out. Also the staffs very warm and friendly attitude made our check in process quite  pleasant experience. Wish the ground staff at other airports would also follow suit.,0
"Melbourne (Tullamarine) to Gold Coast (Coolangatta). Very good flight with Jetstar. By far the best cheap travel airline Ive ever been on. Not really any help at Melbourne. Self check in and the odd couple of Jetstar people walking around. We checked in online so we just bag dropped our bags. A bit of a wait at boarding but I guess thats cheap travel for you. Me and my family had starter plus so $30 (Australian money) on food, drink ect. Legroom a bit little but it was a short flight to be fair. No TVs on the domestic flights but if you fly international with Jetstar youll have TVs. Again, very good flight with Jetstar.",0
"Flight: In last month. Brisbane-Cairns. Check in desk forgot to give boarding passes to two elderly passengers sitting nearby us. They had to walk outside security and re check in. The plane arrived into Brisbane 30 minutes late and we sat on the tarmac for an extra thirty minutes awaiting ""paperwork"". It is a budget airline after all so I did not expect much on board service and my expectations were met. Would only book this airline if it is significantly less expensive than the competitor airlines.",1
"Singapore to Bangkok. Started boarding and while in the airbridge next to the plane door the captain orders the closure of the hatch in order to perform an engine trial run. The passengers have to wait standing in the small corridor for this procedure for about 20 minutes. At entering is clear that the plane has not been cleaned from previous flight, there are papers on the floor and there is some food leftovers on the seats. Plane smells not being properly air conditioned, the seatsleg space is bellow the acceptable minimal and when the passenger in front of me reclines the seat it smashes my knees. Given the price its definitely not worthy since there are many alternative flights cheaper that offer better leg room and also better service and better food. I would definitely not fly them again.",1
"Cairns to Sydney. I negotiated an exit row seat at checkin and 5 minutes before take off, I was advised that I and the others in my row had to change seats. I asked why and I was told that it is usually due to young families that need to be kept together. I said, no problem, and gathered up my things. As I was about to move to my next seat, which was much less appealing than my original seat, I saw the passengers who I had changed seats for. It was four men, middle aged. who had arrived late, and appeared to have been drinking. Not a young family, but some blokes that wanted to continue drinking together, and obviously had some friends at Jetstar who accommodated them. What a joke! This is not the way to be treat full fare paying passengers and I and my business will not use Jetstar in the future.",1
"Paid for the package including hold baggage, a meal on the flight and the pre-selected seats. We selected the meal online but on the flight we were given a different meal and told ""This is the meal you selected, all passengers with that package get the same meal"". I didn't even try the provided sandwich. I knew I wouldn't like it and it looked terrible. Another in our party tried it and said it was awful. Also tried to upgrade baggage beforehand but the site wouldn't accept either of my bank cards. I believe it was because I was on mobile but they told me their site works on mobile and it was a problem with my card. Two cards failed to work and one notifies me if the payment is declined so I know there was no problem on my side. Luckily, I left the option on as unpaid so wasn't charged extra at the airport. They didn't tell me this was an option while I was on the live chat with them though. An on the subject of the live chat, anything typed into the box, even if you don't press send, is sent to the agent. They only record messages which are ""sent"" which can mean accidental pastes are sent (perhaps a password for example?) and they have no record that their employee received it. Also, if you want a copy of everything said in the chat, you have to speak to a different team. This is basic functionality available in most live chat services. I contacted them with a complaint. The first response was just excuses and the offer of a voucher which can only be used by me and expires in 6 months. I live in the UK so completely useless. I contacted them again and they said they had forward some of my comments on to the development team around the live chat but nothing was said about the meal or voucher. The only positive things I can think of is the we made it to our destination and the ground staff at Sydney were helpful.",1
"I booked Jetstar for interstate travel - Sydney to Darwin in the month of August 2021. I was relocating to Darwin to work for an organization that I was chasing for 1 year. Before I confirm my ticket I contacted Jetstar customer service and confirmed that their flight is communicating from Sydney to Darwin as the COVID lockdown situation was going on. They also mentioned if you have the NT border pass and you have a valid reason to travel you are eligible for interstate travel. After confirming that I booked the flight with Jetstar, then the disaster situation start - total my flight cancel and rescheduled 4 times in 2 weeks, and later on, I booked another ticket with Qantas to travel to Darwin. And refund policy or reschedule policy is a different painful process with Jetstar. I will never recommend Jetstar to anyone or will share this experience with everyone in my workplace, home, and with friends.",1
SUB-SIN and SIN-SUB. Cheap price since it's a new route with high load factor. Cramped seats for SIN bound flights and spacious seat on return flight in emergency exit row and bulkhead which you can ask for free. Only snacks and mineral water offered at expensive prices and crews only provide immigration cards during the flight. Airline's magazine is only form of entertainment.,1
"Most unreliable airline. At 6pm, less than 12 hours to our flight, Jetstar sends a text message to say our flight is delayed due to technical requirement. I went straight to their website and saw that they were still selling tickets at the original time for almost triple the price! Its obvious they are moving us around to get more business! We had booked the time of the flight so that our baby can nap! Now she is going to miss her nap at the beginning of our holiday!",1
"Cancelled my flight for three times, refuse to refund. I had to pay $148 for overweight fine, but it's not like I had too much of an overweight. AirAsia fine me this much for not even two kilos of luggage, but show no apology when cancelling my flight for 3 times? That's really absurd.",1
DRW-DPS-DRW. Check-in quick. Staff polite and helpful. Departure slightly delayed due to late arrival of aircraft from southern port. Flight uneventful. Ordered a sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. Check-in at DPS was quick. Counter staff very helpful and polite. Flight left early. Very smooth and quiet. Arrived in DRW early. Baggage available quickly. My major concern is that Jetstar frequently either cancels or delays flights for no apparent reason. Getting to and from anywhere on time seems to be a matter of luck.,0
"Sushmita, the air hostess in GE5387 was very helpful to retrieve food as complimentary service for my children. I had preponed the tickets and the meals were paid for the tickets but the new tickets were last minute and food bookings could not be re-applied to the renewed tickets. She helped and took keen interest to resolve the matter. Wish her the best",0
Honolulu to Sydney - a 10+ hour flight in Business Class. Booked using AA Miles and thought we'd booked Qantas. 1 week before our trip we discovered it was on JetStar. This was our honeymoon and my husband is 6 ft 3 and a big man. We braced ourselves for a miserable flight. However the flight was a pleasure. Food was delicious. True legroom is tight and when the seat in front of you is reclined you cannot get out without disturbing your neighbors. A lovely amenity kit provided. The earphones were extremely comfortable and the pre-loaded Ipad has a nice choice of entertainment. Flight attendants were warm professional and accommodating. As for rating the value for money we used our AA miles so I can only say that it was a most pleasant flight in Business Class with excellent food excellent service nice entertainment options pillows blankets and comfortable leather seats. Other than the seats being a little tight for legroom our flight was a pleasure.,0
"AirAsia from Denpasar to Singapore, the flight I took was QZ502 even though the flight was late it was no fault of the airline. The pilot did a great job of getting us there on time even though we were late in departing by an hour we reached only 20 minutes late so a great effort. The cabin crew were gossiping at the end of the aircraft but what you pay is what you get so no complaints on that. All in all great value for money.",0
We have taken the flight from Indore and we are regular flyers with Indigo. The seats were most uncomfortable. There was hardly any cushioning on the seat. Experience of seat was more or less similar to as if we were seating on wooden bench. You have already curtailed seat pitch and now the un-cushioned seats. You are requested to have some feeling for passengers minimum level of actual comfort also. Looking forward for better and more comfortable seats.,0
"Booked to fly Cebu Pacific from Manila to Iloilo. First, they cancelled my confirmed booking just hours before my flight. I wasn't able to change it via the web due to their system issues. Secondly, they have rescheduled this trip a couple of times, around 4 times. Now I have no free schedules for December and have told them that but they keep insisting on their 30 day rule policy. When I scheduled and booked this flight, I needed to set everything almost a year prior to the trip, and they cancelled it just like that. Now, they insist on their rules not even thinking of any customer service or customer satisfaction.",1
"Airline cancelled my flight and refused to give refund. Instead it offered some ""points"" that (maybe) I can use for my next flight. I do not expect to fly with these cheaters any more, so points are pointless. Same as if a customer pay me for a bed in my furniture shop, but I will tell him ""sorry, I am out of stock, but I will keep your money and may be one day you can come and buy something else"". Terrible.",1
"Though a LCC still best airline in India when on time performance is concerned, also clean cabin, ok seats and courteous staff, at any time yes for this airline. Departed on time, arrived the destination before time, what more was needed for a short flight, also clean cabin with smiling cabin crew.",0
"We were flying BKK to SYD but found better value flights booking BKK-SIN separate to the long haul flight strangely. Booking system is great and very flexible. You can pick and choose say Business one leg and economy return. Our SYD-SIN flight was cancelled and Scoot automatically re-booked us 1 day earlier. This didn't suit us so agreed to change at no extra cost and also changed the next leg returning to BKK bought on a separate booking. Also impressive from an LCC. Flew Business class from BKK to SIN return because the marginal extra costs wasn't that much more. Good seat pitch space. Not too full. Leather seats a little hard but OK. Food ordered was changed but no big deal on short flight. Staff were never rude but they were not overly friendly which was a surprise given their supposed ""Scootitude"" (attitude). Bought Business for the late night overnight SIN to SYD because we wanted space to sleep and was glad. Very empty with only 8 passengers so we all shuffled around and had a bench each. Except that 2 of the 3 middle row arm rests would not lift up so it wasn't really a bed. Worse luck! On this leg the staff were very attentive and around. On the daylight return SYD to SIN we flew the extra space yellow seats in the child free front economy cabin. This was very good and highly recommended. Great amount of space and worth the slight extra premium charge. Had an excellent meal on this leg with free rum and coke. Again not much attention from the staff to be honest but remember this is LCC. Only one minor point was that when we checked in for one leg we wanted to upgrade to buy the business lounge service in SIN and were told that it was too late. Rules are rules but there was at least 2 hours to go before the flight and that seemed petty to me frankly. I had been hoping to use a tablet for the entertainment but the system doesn't support a tablet. Pity but no big deal. Lastly all 4 flights were extremely punctual. I was surprised. All in we will definitely fly Scoot again. Great value and a pleasant surprise. But as with any LCC don't have high expectations and you won't be disappointed.",0
Manila to Iloilo. You think you get a good deal. You better off paying a little more with trusted airline than them. Customer service is the worst I have ever experience. Never I will recommend this airline. Their website sure you dont do any changes because is you do even you dont confirm the changes it will go through and it will change you again. If you cancel with all the changes that they will deduct you get about 1-2 % of what you paid. Big big mistake on my part to try this airline.,1
"Auckland to Christchurch. To say our overseas guests are unimpressed is putting it mildly. After getting up at 4.40am to catch our flight in order to pick up our prebooked vehicle, we discovered the flight had been cancelled due to 'mechanical problems'. Jetstar has to have the most unreliable fleet of planes ever - constant cancellations due to this. Yeah right. On trying to rebook, the ""customer service"" agent refused to put us on an earlier flight as we had 'agreed to the terms and conditions of Jetstar'.",1
I took the flight to Kolkata on IndiGo. The web check in was done smoothly and it must be noted that the seats at the rear are cheaper as compared to those in the front which is strange as they are the same seats.  The baggage drop was done quickly and efficiently at BLR airport. And boarding started well on time. The crew were welcoming during boarding which was good and the arrival and baggage collection was also Swift. Overall an uneventful flight which took me from point A to B without too much fuss.,0
We flew from Sydney to Bangkok and then from Phuket to Sydney. Staff were so rude and were unable to answer any questions. There was no inflight entertainment. If you wanted entertainment you had to pay extra for e-books. However there were none available on our flight. Even people who had pre-booked them couldn't get them because they were out. There were 3 of us travelling and we did not get seated together even though we checked in together. A family on our flight were also separated. Our flights were delayed also. I will never fly them again. Pay the extra money and go with another company.,1
"Melbourne to Sydney. I have been flying for business for 5 years no problems, but today Jetstar charged 60 dollars for my bag weighing 9 kilos. Change of clothes computer and a toothbrush. That is utterly ridiculous as it is well undersized and fits in the overhead locker easily.",1
"This is the worst airline I have encountered and I travel extensively. Their policies are deceitful and customer service is not willing to help or even explain their policies at all. I went to check in for my flight and had already paid for my bags when I had purchased my flight. When I checked they were charging me an additional 4,000 pesos for my bags which I never even selected. When I brought this error up twice with customer service they said they could not help because I did not screenshot the error. Of course I did not screenshot any error because that amount was reflected on my account without me doing absolutely anything. Even worse they just told me that if I did not settle the balance they would not let me board the flight. This is just mind blowing and appalling.",1
"Siem Reap Cambodia - KUL on 27 November. Check in was quick - my bag was over the 20 kg limit so they let me re- pack and carry on a 2nd carry-on the signs all over say ""only 1 carry-on allowed"" but I never saw anyone say anything to customers with multiple carry-on bags. Agents were friendly both on the ground and in the air. Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing. Think its a standard of Air Asia to not announce delays promptly. Flight was good - 2 hours and again a seat in the middle free. Bought noodles and snacks - good value for money and delicious. Landed at KUL Terminal 2 about 45 minutes late and bags came out fairly quickly. Enjoyed the flight and definitely a good fare.",0
Dunedin to AucklandApp does not work and it is so hard to navigate. Check in was a nightmare because I had to check in a box and that was apparently unusual but I have never had a problem regarding this with Other airlines. Cabin crew did not greet and one of them just had way too much attitude. Seat was not comfortable and flight was so delayed. They text us saying gates close at 4pm sharp but gates opened at 3:58. Absolutely ridiculous cannot plan anything in advance if youre flying this airlines. Will not be flying with them again.,1
Utapao to Kuala Lumpur. I travelled from my favorite airport from Utapao. I love flying from this airport as it is so small. I used the new terminal for the first time. I will fly them again.,0
"Iloilo to Manila. Flight was delayed. Very rude employees collecting tickets to board the plane. They dont even know what a pwd (person with disability) id is. They asked if my mom has a senior id card for boarding ahead. She showed her pwd id card! This is in Iloilo airport. If i was given a choice, i would fly a different airline. Definitely not this one.",1
Queenstown to Auckland. Beware of luggage fees! Make sure you buy exactly what your bags weigh before you get to the airport. Once checking in they charge $15 per KG extra than what you originally paid for.,1
"Melbourne to Hong Kong via Singapore. Scoot cheated me I bought ticket 4 months ago. It consists 2 flights depart on 19 Mar 2020, the 2nd connecting flight is from Singapore to Hong Kong. I checked again iternary on 18 Mar night, this 2 flights were confirmed. But early i arrive airport to check-in, staff told me the 2nd flight to HK has been cancelled and seem they can cancel flight any time with no advance notification and no valid reason. The Scoot manager in Melbourne airport was unhelpful only saying flight cancelled and insist cannot offer alternative/solution,  and said no next Scoot flight to HK in coming days, Scoot can take me to Singapore only or can get refund.  I paid for the whole journey, Scoot has moral obligation to fulfill Client's requirement or solve their created problem. Strongly advise not taking Scoot despite some cheap sale ticket as cannot compensate your loss in the end.",1
"Flight left Brisbane around 45 minutes late, but arrived ahead of schedule. The only reviews where people complain are the ones who don't pre-book meals, entertainment etc. We had added bags, meals, entertainment and comfort packs when booking and it was like flying a full service airline. We paid for 2 people return what 1 person would cost on Hawaiian Airlines so cannot complain. Jetstar are not a terrible airline you just get what you pay for.",0
"I have been flying Air Asia for a long time and I love them for their predictability and ease of use. On this flight from Singapore to Bali they use their standard A320, which is, well, standard and nothing special. However, their Premium Flex ticket provides many other advantages that Im willing to pay more for. Extra luggage, express boarding, dedicated counter for check-in, an inflight meal, etc. For such short flights, which have become so commoditized, I like having choices that are clearly outlined and well priced. Plus the biggest benefit is that when you pay extra for a hot seat, I nearly always have the whole row to myself.",0
"Singapore to Perth. What a disgrace. We rock up to the airport for the 14th and last flight of a round the world trip. We booked lounge access and Scoot in silence as a treat to cap off our 5 week holiday. We find that our flight was not on the screen so go to the service desk. The lady says that the flight is still on and to head to the appropriate gate. As we were walking away we are called back to be told that the Scoot flight has been cancelled and Scoot has tendered a Singapore Airlines plane but there would be no refreshments or entertainment offered. On top of that we lost our lounge access and Scoot in silence. About a week after we got home I find out that there has been fraudulent activity carried out with my credit card in India, one of our stops around the world. I had to get a new card. I then started the process to get my money refunded from Scoot and that has continued to this day (5 months later). They will not accept my new card details which has been provided in the form of an official letter from my bank. They are thieves and will not accept that they have stuffed us around no end. I will never fly with them again.",1
Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.,1
"This airline has so many hidden fees, they will charge you fees plus penalty for any luggage weight exceeding 7 kg per passenger. The flight was a disaster with kids noise, and way too much passengers bags in the above-head compartments and under-seats storage.",1
Just flew 9 flights in total with Air Asia X and Air Asia: Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur - Kuala Lumpur to Vietnam - Vietnam to Kuala Lumpur - Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong - Hong Kong to Penang - Penang to Langkawi - Langkawi to Penang - Penang to Kuala Lumpur - Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast. Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available. I believe improvements can be made in this area. Otherwise the seats facilities service is great - expect to get what you pay for and you'll be more than happy.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Makassar. The manual check-in system in down when our visit. So, we use the Air Asia self-check-in System, so no problem with check-in. The immigration queue is terrible, extremely long and took a lot of time, I wait around 45 minutes for immigration. The in-flight meal is great, delicious. The flight attendant is nice.",0
"Denpasar to Jakarta. I  picked Lion Air because it was the cheapest of all budget airlines (compared to Air Asia, Citilink, etc). The flight was delayed by 1.5 hour and another 30 minutes delay on flight. Apparently this is a regular thing to happen according to my other flight. The onboard experience was not pleasant. The seatbelt that I have was broken so it couldnt lock, which is very dangerous. The washroom is not well taken care of. The toilet seat was broken and the soap container was extremely dirty. The flight attendant are ok. The seats are ok. There werent any in flight entertainment, only the security procedure pamphlet (if you can find it entertaining, thats good) For the price difference of 20 dollar, it was not worth the flight. So I would rather choose other better budget airlines.",1
"Launceston to Melbourne. Found the booking procedure easy to manage from the UK. Check in at Launceston was simple, straight forward, efficient and calm. Loved the 'RELAX' on the departure board prior to flights being called/boarding gates called etc. Tthe flight was on time in terms of both departure from Launceston and arrival in Melbourne. Staff were friendly, helpful and very pleasant.",0
"Bangkok to Riyadh via Mumbai. Really bad airline and transfer, I havent seen this long of a queue at the airport check in. Slow process. Bad uncomfortable seats, minimum everything, as the airplane was under staffed for sure (2 only for a huge airplane). Its not like the price paid for ticket is even cheap, its at the average or even more. But they suck so bad.",1
"I have flown quite a number of budget airlines in Asia and Scoot is by far the worst and most unprofessional one. Our flight from Singapore to Kochi was delayed for 1 hour and the pilot neither acknowledged the delay nor offered an apology. Crew members were untrained, rude, and had extremely poor language skills. The return journey from Kochi to Singapore, only upon asking at check in desk we were told that the plane was delayed for an hour. But we were puzzled to see that the original departure time was printed on the boarding pass. Nowhere else in the airport or at the departure gate was there an indication or announcement of the delay. Upon tracking the flight status of the incoming plane we realized that the flight was delayed for at least 2 hours, and passengers were not promptly updated. At the end of the flight, again there was no acknowledgement of the 2 hr delay nor an apology. When we feedback to the crew member she just drew a blank poker face and did not bother to respond. It was appaling to see a budget carrier associated with Singapore Airlines go so low in service standards. Definitely never flying Scoot again.",1
"It was a bad letdown on 6E 202 from Nagpur to Pune - The seats were tattered and stained - The seat pockets were torn - There was litter in odd places - The bathrooms were dirty and stinking - The value of 400 was not met and instead of Chicken Noodles, I got Poha - The staff never gave me water despite asking twice.",0
"I want to leave my feedback on the poor service we got from Scoot on our return flight, Amritsar - Singapore on 6 Feb. We experienced a delay of more than 3 hours. Our flight was supposed to leave Amritsar at 6h40am and left after 9h30. No explanation is given but the staff were very thorough in checking all the luggage with a couple of kgs above the limit so they could charge the overweight excess to the passengers. Scoot kept 200+ passengers waiting for more than 3 hours without proper explanation or apology. After a 5h30 long flight, we arrive at Changi Airport (Singapore) and are told to wait because the aircraft doesn't have a place to taxi. We wait 45 min inside the aircraft, again with no proper apology or any kind of proper compensation. On a full flight with plenty of families with small kids, they don't even have the courtesy to give out some water for the children. To top it off, we reach the belts area to collect our luggage and our flight is not even announced on any screen. The passengers have to go around and guess which belt is our luggage being dumped on. For a flight that costs 400SGD return, the service offered is shamefully poor. It shows lack of professionalism and respect for customers. It shows that the airline is more interested in making a profit on overweight charges than on the comfort and wellbeing of your passengers. Don't recommend.",1
"Night flight JQ29 from Bangkok to Melbourne. It pulled away from the gate at precisely 9:25 pm, and got into Melbourne 15 minutes ahead of schedule. We like it when airlines are punctual. I'd reserved a seat for $13, 55G, having suffered 9 hours in a middle seat coming up from Melbourne. Evening snack was a Ham & Cheese toastie, not bad, nice and hot, with a hot chocolate drink, for $12, pretty much what you'd pay in a Melbourne high street cafe, or less. An hour out of Melbourne I was given a chocolate cake and a coffee, the cake was moist, again at $6 pretty good value. The cabin was quiet, the crew was attentive, coming around regularly offering glasses of water. One of those low key professional cabin crews going about their business. Arrived at about 10:10. Melbourne Airport was a shambles, they don't seem able to deal with a number of flights arriving at the same time. The queue to exit at Customs was long.",0
"I took a Jetstar flight on 27th January to Narita, Japan from the Gold Coast. I travelled in economy class and understood that Jetstar is a low cost carrier and you have to pay for extras. I ate in the terminal so there was no need to eat on the plane. I also had a coffee before leaving the Gold Coast airport as I had time to spare. I did also purchase a coffee and a cake in advance from their website for the trip. Check in was very easy as I only had carry on luggage. I was able to use the check in machines which are easy to use. There was a slight problem leaving as the immigration gate malfunctioned that I was using. I was manually processed. The flight was smooth with no problems to report. I will fly Jetstar again.",0
"Nothing to complain about really, normal seats, OK food, good service, extra beer and wine for just a few $, orders go via inflight wifi and delivered straight to your seat. Free internet too but speeds are very slow. Overall, with the fare+bag fee+ seat fee+ food fee and extras it was still a few 100$ cheaper than flying with a major airline.",0
"When I was going from Perth to Melbourne for a competition, I flew on JetStar, the thing about it is that all the food was needing money and there was no WiFi or inflight entertainment. The good side is that the staff were really nice and the seats were very comfy.",0
"Q402 SYD-OOL was very good especially the efficient boarding and on-time take-off. However, the return flight was the stuff of nightmares. The vast majority of the passengers was travelling to Sydney for the Taylor Swift concert. Their inane, like, conversations throughout, like, the whole flight was not the fault of the airline nor their singing. But there is no excuse for playing Taylor Swift songs over the PA at a volume so loud the songs were distorted. Who knows the sensitivities of those passengers not travelling to the concert? Statistics would indicate many on board have no interest in the latest pop star and could well be travelling while dealing with grief or illness for example. Cabin crew failed to display the appropriate awareness of their passengers and were totally unprofessional.",1
"Possible the worst economy flight. I was scheduled to fly from Taiwan at 1:30am and transfer from singapore to Bali at 7:15 am, but when I arrived at Taiwan airport I was told that my flight was delay for 3 hours without prior notification, so my second flight will be canceled cuz the first flight cant make it on time.  I asked the flight attendant at Taiwan for my second flight information, the flight attendant simply inform me that she didnt know and ask me to find information at singapore airport.  Flight attendant at singapore airline help me to arrange to next flight which is fine. I kept asking whether I still need to check in my baggage manually but she told me that they will arrange it for me. When i arrived at Bali for baggage claim, I waited for 3 hours for my baggage which i found that my baggage still in Singapore. My whole trip was ruined without any single clothes and my other things. I asked scoots lost and found at Bali airport for help but they barely reply to my message and I dont even know what is my baggage status yet for 2 days and still counting.",1
Jetstar is a low-cost carrier but still they could do a little better in some specific areas to avoid disappointing their customers. For example: I was flying 3K764 KIX-MNL and they offer online check in. But when you get to the airport the special line for online checked in passengers is closed and you have to queue with the regular passengers. The local Jetstar staff doesn't seem to understand the concept of on-line check in and frequent travelers would agree with me that it's quite annoying. The overall friendliness of the onboard staff is average or below average.,0
"Much better than expected. After reading bad reviews I was very apprehensive. My flights - 3 in total, 1st 20 min late, 2nd 30 min late, 3rd 60 min late. I was fine with this, it really wasnt too bad. I received my luggage fine (I did make sure v secure after reading all probs with stolen items). Thanks Lion air, you were better than the reviews.",0
"Sydney to Dubai via Manila, I tried to add extra bags to my ticket, so many times, unfortunately, it was kind of impossible to do that, clearly, it was meant to build that way so the passengers won't be able to do that online, thus, they will be charged more money while they checking in at the counter. That's not the issue only, they charged me two time for my 25 kg bag, once when I checked in from Sydney airport to Manila, and the one more time when I checked in from Manila to Dubai, however it's the exact same airline, same flight booking. They just simply reaping off the passengers' money, for nothing, underlining of the claim of company policy. It's my first experience with Cebu Pacific Airlines and for sure it would be the last, so kindly be advised and take the right choice not to book with this airline.",1
"I travelled by Air Asia recently, on an afternoon flight from Delhi to Kochi (I5 549). I had booked the ticket about 2-3 weeks in advance, and got a very good deal on it. The check-in was smooth. There was some delay at the gate and boarding had not started till the scheduled time for departure. Eventually we boarded about 15 Mins beyond the scheduled departure time. The take-off was quite perfect! However, the rest of the flight was smooth, except for one patch of turbulence. The plane was clean and the seat was comfortable. Even though my seat was in 24 row, leg space was not an issue. This flight was an exception. The cabin crew, especially Mr Zebran, were extremely attentive and polite. He made me feel like an honoured guest. Also the food quality was excellent. The landing at Kochi was smooth and the luggage arrived on time. Extra marks for the hospitable cabin crew! Kudos to the team and Obviously Air Asia. Will fly back soon",0
It began in Vietnam in Da Nang. I went online to see the flight status and it was unavailable. We called through and found the flight that was scheduled for a 5.15 pm departure had been delayed. Because the status was unavailable online we were not able to book a late checkout with our hotel. We made our way to Da Nang airport booked a single room so we could have somewhere to wait until 10pm for our re-scheduled check-in for a 12.50am flight. Arrived at the airport at 10pm to find it was not flying until after 2.00 am the plane arrived around 2.45 we arrived in Saigon just before 3.45pm. The flight crew looked exhausted and their safety demonstration was poorly demonstrated. The food was inedible and the captain made no attempt to communicate with the passengers regarding the delay. This was the worst flight experience I have had and the first time with JetStar.,1
Mumbai-Bangalore. Flight on time great service from airport check-in to end stage. Well planned and executed model for passenger satisfaction. Taken to the aircraft by bus this afternoon flight was full yet the flight attendants were calm and courteous. They worked seamlessly with an almost natural smile. Aircraft clean. Onboard options for food were plenty though slightly pricey.,0
Mumbai to Bangalore. IndiGo is the best domestic airline of India. The seats were very comfortable and the food was excellent. The cabin crew were polite and had a welcoming nature. The pilot kept us well-informed about the delays. The Takeoff and landing was a smooth one. I had an amazing experience with this airline and would keep on travelling with them.,0
"Definitely not a low cost carrier. I booked 2 tickets from Singapore to Bangkok for $826. When I checked with Singapore Airlines, their parent company, the cost of 2 tickets with the same dates cost only $801. When I submitted a request to cancel my booking in order to book Singapore Airlines, they refused citing that their prices are competitive.",1
"My first time flying with Scoot having read so many negative reviews for this airline. I found a great deal one way to Bangkok and just couldn't resist, so I took a chance. Around 200 AUD one way. Overall my experience was not too bad. If you expect something fancy from this budget airline, you have to ask something, what is important? Is comfort important or simply getting from point A to B? I chose the latter. Most of the time I took a nap while listening to music, so I wasn't in too much discomfort. Leg room was decent. My advice bring your own pillow if you have trouble sleeping on the plane. Overall Scoot did the job. This isn't Singapore Airlines in any manner. If being economical is important for you, give Scoot a try.",0
"I travelled in indigo flight on 2nd august 2023 from Sharjah to Hyderabad and Hyderabad to Mangalore (connecting flight). I received my baggage in Hyderabad airport, cleared the custom and connected the luggage to next flight but when i arrived Mangalore my baggage was not there. The crew have told the baggage is left in Hyderabad because of MCT and she promised me that they will be connecting my baggage in the evening flight from Hyderabad to Mangalore, in evening i called them to follow up this issue and they told that its not yet received and they promised it will be received at night on same day. Again i have called them at night and asked about baggage they said that baggage is not arrived yet and it will be received on next day flight on 4th august, so i have called them today again in the morning to about baggage they told that it has been not received and the Hyderabad team is not responding. I have taken Hyderabad teams number and called them on my own and they are telling that they don't have any baggage. I'm very Disappointed with this kind response from indigo, its been 52 hours and there is no trace of my bag.",1
"Darwin to Denpasar. What an unfair airline. Very rude customer service live chat they provide. Matters were not resolved we were put in a difficult situation. We had to cancel the flight because of corona virus travel warnings and when we asked if we can get a refund or some date change we were told we are not entitled for a refund and the agent totally mislead us by charging another extra 468 aud per person for a date and flight route change. So in total on top of the booking we have already done of 954 aud we were asked to pay another 865 aud for changing the existing booking. In a situation of a global crisis we were very disappointed of how Jetstar handled the situation. Unfair money suckers. This is how they treat their customer. Such disappointment. There is no way we could lodge a proper complain, never fly again with Jetstar",1
Melbourne to Perth. Airbus A320 which was very clean and much nicer than the Qantas B767 I flew to Melbourne on. Ground crew in Melbourne and Perth pleasant and helpful. However service onboard was quite poor and staff seemed disinterested. But it's a budget airline so it's to be expected. Upon arrival At Perth no gates at the terminal were available so our aircraft parked in the middle of the tarmac and we were bussed to the terminal when we landed the buses were busy and we had to wait 40 minutes in Perth for a bus from the plane to the terminal. Melbourne's Jetstar gates are a luxury compared to Perth. Overall a good experience for the price I paid for the flight.,0
"The flight was shown as on-time but when I approached the desk and was told by staff it was delayed by 10 minutes, then told 20 minutes, an hour later we were asked to walk to another gate to a replacement plane. Once seated another passenger showed me his boarding pass that was the same seat as mine. The cabin crew tried telling me I was in the wrong seat, despite me showing my pass that she claimed was one row. I pointed out that row was already full, and I offered to move to the adjacent seat next seat. No explanation or was forthcoming for duplicate boarding passes.",1
"Puerto Princesa to Ho chi Minh via Manila.  I booked 3 flights with Cebu Pacific and not each one of them was a proper service. The first flight has been delayed for 10 hours and they let me know with an email just 3 hours before departing. I was obviously expecting a refund - what they could give me was only 10 dollars of free food in the airport. Do you call it customer service? The second flight checkin process was a nightmare; regardless I booked a connection flight they said the system was down so they were not able to check me in the connection. Once again I have not been updated; so I needed to exit the transfer area and check in all over again in Manila. Of course this was not finished, they gave me the wrong gate number for the departure and once I get into the desk the flight was already departed. The next available flight was 24 hours later and  Manila Airport is not pleasant at all to stay. Once again, the staff was only able to laugh and play with each other even on my frustration. I experienced the worst customer service ever with Cebu and I do not recommend it to anyone. C",1
"I flew PER-MEL on 1st July. The flight boarded well ahead of the departure time but sat at the gate for 45 minutes probably because the Qantas systems were down that day and Qantas passengers were being shuffled onto our flight. We made up time and arrived early. Cabin crew were led by a Staff Development Manager so were on best behaviour. A reviewer below mentioned that all other Australian airlines have 30-33"" seat pitch - I'm not sure this is quite true (Tiger run the same aircraft type with the same number of seats and some Virgin seating is very tight these days) but some seats are definitely better than others. What I don't understand is why they only run A320's to Perth - these are the longest domestic flights and according to the website their A321s and A330s have more generous seat pitch.",0
Sunshine Coast to Sydney. Problem with plane while taxiing. Delayed 3 hours. Later flight cancelled. No voucher or compensation. We have no choice at this airport and flights are always delayed or cancelled. Terrible timetabling for business people traveling to Sydney Melbourne. Totally sick of this non service.,1
"Tagbilaran to Manila. Flying Cebu Pacific is like riding a bus! You pay what you get for! No service at all times. At the Check-In staff always well trained to seek for additional sales. Like when you are in your limits of baggage you can see the disappointment in their eyes that no money can be taken from you! Delays are not being announced. My travel partner was not able to make the flight. All reservations from my side were done through my credit card accounts and I booked everything through their website! As we had one booking, I needed to call 5J as I was not able to split the booking myself through their website. Calling them takes quite a while time, getting hold of them takes time. The agent I spoke to was friendly, providing me options within my case. As a rebooking for my travel companion was out of question listening to their options in our case, he decided to fly a different carrier! I was given the option that I could not refund the ticket although the ticket was refundable, instead I would be given a travel fund for 90 days! I was OK with that option cause I knew I would be flying again sooner. I asked the agent to split our booking and I was advised all further processes you can do through our website as you will be able now to change/rebook/cancel yourself online. I asked also the Travel Fund will be processed through my option to cancel and I was confirmed. Trusting the fact that I could manage all on my own, I did cancel the booking one day after in the knowing I will have a travel fund. What I was not told that the travel fund will now be only claimable under the surname of the booking carried in the booking! Which was now my travel companion and not mine. I paid all tickets and I did pay above 10.000PHP for this one way flight from Bohol to Manila. I felt sure and assured through my call that I can cancel it through the website and not needing to place a call again as waiting time and costs to save! So I cancelled all through the website! Doing this with the secure feeling of eveything I wanted to purchase a new ticket for myself. After being back in Europe I called 5J at least more than 30 minutes to find out that I will not be able to collect my travel fund on my name and to being told that I did agree to the conditions given as it clearly states online. I explained the call center agent the situation and she forwarded my case to an escallation team, and I was told I could call back within 24-48 hrs to find out of further results. I called back 27 hrs after, no updates spending 20 mins to find out, I callled 57 hrs after after spending 40 mins with waiting on hold in line due to busy agents noone available. I decided to contact 5J through Social Media - answer after 10 hrs NO UPDATE. After additional 2 hrs I was contacted by 5J via phone. My request was declined. Clearly 5J does not really care who pays the tickets of its passengers - their policies are clearly made to keep funds pending and to make it difficult for someone to claim their money! 5J does not care about their passengers, they just care about your money. 3300 PHP will be a gift to them as they stick to their policy not understanding the customers side.",1
"I was set to travel from Denpasar to Seattle, which was a 3 flight trip on July 31st 2022 at 23:15pm. The morning of my flight, Jetstar canceled the first leg (DPS to MEL) for engineering issues. They offered to book me a new flight, so I would not miss my connecting flights, but did not process my booking in time. All the flights filled up, so I was screwed. I ended up having to take 2 new flights day of and lost 600 USD just to make my next two flights. Jetstar refuses to compensate this because they 'offered' me a flight via their policy, even thought they screwed me even worse by not booking in time. Never again.",1
Manila to Melbourne. Very poor customer service and extremely lengthy check in periods. I was asked to arrive 3hrs ahead of my flight which I did only to waste over an hour queuing to check in and drop my bags. The most frustrating fact was that there were over 9 Cebu Pacific check in employees standing idle with only 2 employees actually at the check in desk. It is such a shame and regretful waste of time for customers.,1
Good cheap airline. Seats quite close together but ok for short flight. Staff polite and helpful. It offers very cheap fights within Asia and you can pre-book extra weight luggage at very a reasonable price. Have used this airline on numerous different flights and they have always been reliable. This is the first time I have landed at LCCT in KUL - ladies loos very dirty. Chaotic but not too bad luggage didn't take too long to arrive.,0
19-20 March my first and last trip with Scoot TZ 8 and TZ 7. The cabin crews were fine despite a long delay. From Singapore to Perth I booked a 13.10 hrs flight but the night before I received SMS that stated that my flight was delayed to 16.45 hrs. I arrived at Changi Airport at approximately 14.20 hrs quickly head to departure hall for boarding pass and I saw the flight departure details screen and it stated TZ 8 re-timed to 18.00 hrs! I rushed to the counter for an explanation. The Scoot personnel did not apologise and would not explain the reason for the delay. They gave me a meal coupon of $10 per person. My return flight on 20 March the same thing. I book the 19.10 hrs flight and it was delayed to 22.35 hrs! This is with no meal coupon. I am so disappointed. I am sure that this going to be my first and last trip with Scoot airlines.,1
"Manila to Sydney. I should have check this site before buying my Cebu pacific tickets. Allowing only one luggage check-in and we were charge a very expensive 2nd luggage amounting to $350 US, food and drinks are not free, pillows and blankets are not free, and seating are narrow and cramp.  My message to those checking out this airline, go check other airline and never fly with Cebu Pacific.",1
"Bangalore to Mumbai. Indigo's late night flights are always late. This is my third experience with same flight - flight is delayed by 1hr 10mins, last time when I travelled a month before then it was delayed by 2 hours this is really horrible. Generally this flight is taken by one who attends office whole day and then come for flight and you face this issue again and again. Indigo will lose it's reputation if they continue to do so.",1
"I have almost every week flown Lion Air from Jakarta to Singapore, taking the first flight out. Experience begins from check-in where there is always a queue and have to wait long for your turn. (This is likely where the delays originate). The aircraft is parked at the apron and a bus will take you there from the gate, usually a short distance away. During boarding, the FA never checks boarding passes. Seats are poor in legroom and cramped. Since this is a budget airline, there is no IFE, simple F+B can be purchased. Cleanliness can be poor at times as there are uncleared rubbish in the seat pocket. The picture shows a very hazy view out of the window with lots of dust stuck between the panes. On the other hand, FAs are polite and nice, sometimes too nice or perhaps slightly lax to ensure safety on board is adhered to. However, fares are cheap and one can't complain much for that price. Just bring along a good book or a neck pillow and snooze.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi in December 2016. I and my partner have always chosen to book with Air Asia as our preference for Asia. I booked and realised that I had the wrong date, it was the 22nd and not the 23rd. Okay, I should have seen this but I didn't. It may even have been the sites fault as I am so careful booking. I noticed this within seconds after the confirmation came in. I tried to call and after a wait of over 100 minutes, the call was answered. I was cut off by their agent. Infuriating and an absolute disgrace and contempt for their passenger. A wait of this length says it all about their attitude. Wait long enough so you hang up? The problem then goes away? I emailed 6 weeks ago and am still waiting for a reply. I had to book again and lose the first flight for both of us. Why do AirAsia not allow minor changes within a set time, say 12/24 hours? Not have a proper customer service centre that will call you back if wait times are over, say fifteen minutes or reply to your email? AirAsia has lost their shine for us.",1
SYD to HKT return Business Class. Both flights on time. Service level very good. ood has improved and was very tasty. Very good value product.,0
"My flight was cancelled by Air Asia due to restrictions caused by Covid in February 2020. I have been waiting since that time (eight months and counting) for a refund, as is Air Asia's legal obligation. AA have renegued multiple times in promises to repay me in that time. Now, despite not receiving a cent in refund, my case according to Air Asia, is now 'closed'. This is to inform Air Asia, that while the amount of money I have lost is not life changing, I think I speak for thousands of other former passengers cheated out of funds by you when I say that I will do everything in my power to never fly AA again. You may be desperate to stay in business but you have no right to effectively steal funds from passengers. I sincerely hope Air Asia goes bankrupt.",1
Bangalore to Chennai with AirAsia. Pathetic. Very unpunctual. Flight was delayed multiple times. Nearly 6 hrs delay to Chennai. If informed earlier could have caught a bus. Was travelling to meet a relative in critical condition.,1
"I used Indigo for the first time yesterday. All went very well but for the very last leg back to Chennai. I had requested a wheelchair for all legs of the journey but nothing turned up in Chennai! Eventually the crew left, the Captain left, Co-pilot gone, I had been told to wait so eventually I asked again and the ground staff man said everyone was gone! Yes I said, except me! So after a long wait someone turned up with a child's wheelchair! I'm 6 foot plus! After a further long wait a wheelchair turned up. Surely any staff must ensure that passengers are taken care of before leaving the vessel for their own comfort.",0
"Lombok to Jakarta. Worst flying experience I have experienced. First, there is no transparency about the departing time, 2 hours of delay (which turned out into 3 hour delay) because of operational reasons, the desk operator doesnt gave us the clear and complete information about the delay, and they were rude to the customers. A dirty cabin. We have to wait for a long time for a shuttle airport bus after a late-night flight (about 30 minutes) and then wait 45 minutes to get our baggage. This is definitely my last time flying using this airline.",1
"Singapore to Perth. The flight was delayed repeatedly and we were informed after we arrived at the airport. The baggage drop-off queue was about 100 persons long since there was only 1 staff-person attending that took 45 minutes of waiting which makes a mockery of doing on-line check-in. The cabin crew spoke poor and heavily accented English even for crucial announcements, and seemed flustered all the time - as when asked any question. They did nothing to stop a parent allowing a child to play with balloons which burst periodically sounding like a gun-shot. Nor did they stop another woman watching a kung-fu movie on her tablet computer without head-phones. By the time one adds the check-in luggage, meals and seat selection, the ticket costs as much as an SIA flight if booked a little earlier. Since they do not have the same facility to check luggage through to a connecting flight, one has to have the expense and inconvenience of entering a transit country immigration-wise just to collect luggage and check it in again when the other airline commenced check-in many hours later. So the parent company gets almost the same fare for an airline operating much cheaper and so makes a greater profit! Seems like the reason for having Scoot is to run it so poorly is to make SIA look better by contrast, and convince passengers pay the slightly higher fare. In compensation for the flight delay Scoot offered a trifling voucher to use on another flight in the near future - a highly unlikely scenario for most.",1
"Booking a flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 11th March and received a booking failure notice. Proceed with my booking on other airline and got my ticket. Suddenly on 24th March, received another email stated my previous booking was confirmed. Requested a refund but was being rejected. Were forced to chat with the all-star agent after waited for hours but wasn't helpful at all. No other avenue to get back my money.",1
"Worst Airline and their pricebeat guarantee is a complete scam.  This has happened to me twice now, I have applied for a pricebeat again at Air Asia, however they take that long to process it that the price on Air Asia has increased and you end up paying more than if you had booked with Air Asia in the first place. I have complained to their chat consultants but they are patronising, rude and have no clue what they are doing. We also had a situation last year where my boyfriend got food poisoning that struck him when we about the board the aircraft, the captain told us we could not fly due to health and safety concerns. I spoke with the Jetstar team and they assured me they would add notes in the booking to say we were denied due to sickness and Jetstar would simply put us on the next available flight once he was better. Two days later I tried to rebook only to be told that there were no notes in the booking and we had been classified as a no show and therefore had purchase a new ticket. Stay away from Jetstar, they will try anything to scam you out of your money.",1
"Flew on ScootBiz for a short hop from Kaohsiung to Osaka. A new Boeing 787 with decent seat, great leg room and attentive service. I'm more than happy to trade off onboard entertainment, mediocre food one would expect in economy class on a full fare airline for the better seat (think old school regional business class seat) on a new plane. Okay, the food was pretty poor, but I'm not sure what some of other users were expecting of the ScootBiz seat/experience. The fare I paid was comparable to China Airlines Economy fare for this leg. I know for example that Sydney-Singapore on ScootBiz can be cheaper than Economy on SIA.",0
"My family and I had a Manila - Caticlan flight and it couldn't have gone any smoother. We were running late for our check in as there was a car accident on the way and we thought that we would miss our flight. Luckily as we arrived at the counter they were just putting the ""closed"" sign up and they put us through. One of our group member hadn't pre-purchased the baggage allowance so that took a few more minutes to put through. As we were on our way to the gate we heard our names being called and made a quick dash to the gate and again as we arrived the were just closing the gate and they quickly called the bus over to take us to the tarmac! We found them to be very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely travel with them again.",0
"Jetstar waits for our family of 4 to queue up to board, then weighs purses with carry-ons, charges $260 for ""overage"". This was only on return flight no check on going flight, and says ""if you don't pay you can't fly."" Worst airline ever - avoid at all costs.",1
MFM-BKK-HKT. Check-in was easy as I had prepaid for my luggage however I was unable to transfer my baggage at BKK and had to re-check my baggage. Flight was 30 mins delayed with very little updates. Once boarded the service was very professional and efficient. I had pre-ordered meals on both legs meals are quite cheap on the website however if you are hungry I would recommend having two meals.,0
"It is disappointing you are standing firm on your credit only policy, when flights continue to be cancelled or unsuitable due to Covid border closures. I have close to $4000 in vouchers, which I never asked for, the vouchers were forced upon us. It would be very helpful to be permitted a cash refund, and we can then rebook a suitable holiday when the pandemic is over. Forcing passengers to keep monies within your organisation when we would rather take a refund does not bode well for future bookings. I know I will actively choose another carrier in the future than place any trust in Jetstar. Would love to see goodwill offered to your passengers in the way of refunds for these credit vouchers to turn around how we feel about your airline moving forward. Help us be your raving fan.",1
My 17 year old son and I were on a 43 day round the world holiday. While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia cancelled 2 of our segments and replaced them with another 2. The first was only an hour delay so no big deal. However the second one put us into SGN too late to make our connecting flight on to DAD. As soon as we landed in BKK I went to the Air Asia help desk and explained my problem. BTW This is a Thai Air Asia flight. The 2 young staff members couldn't have helped me more. They understood my problem and did a great job fixing it. I've flown them several times and they're a first class low fare carrier. When they charge you for food and drinks on board it's at a reasonable amount. They now only operate out of Don Muang (DMK) but there is a free shuttle between DMK and BKK airport. Great airline great crew in the air and on the ground.,0
Mumbai to Kochi. On time. Not a minute late. Everything was on time. Service is great. Food options are limited. The blue is very pleasing to the eye. Well-organised and a reliable airline. Totally recommend it.,0
We had a trip from Kochi to Ho chi Minh with 1 stop to Kuala Lumpur. Both of our flights were delayed. The first one for over 1 hour and the second for over 3 hours. The seats inside the aircraft are small. We ordered something to eat inflight and most things on the catalogue were missing and the food was very little for one person and the cabin staff didn't have enough change to give you back. I will not travel with this airline again for sure.,1
"I wasn't happy at all. I am a foreigner and I booked the flight at least two months in advance. In these 2 months I received several unsolicited emails for buying extra services (like many airlines do). To days before my flight, when I was in India, I received an email informing that it was time to proceed with web check-in. I did so, but my web check-in failed with with message saying that I was I the ""watch queue"". I contacted the help desk, which was not very quick, but in the meanwhile I browsed the internet and found out that, since I booked my flight with an international credit card I needed to show the credit card at the check-in. Luckily enough, I brought the credit card with me (it was about to expire, and I have more than one credit card, so I really thought I could leave it at home) otherwise they would have denied boarding.  I have no idea why they needed to check my credit card (they didn't explain), and no idea why they didn't send me any email telling me that I needed to show my credit card. Apart for that,  it is a low cost, and it is worth what it costs.",1
"Flew IndiGo from Kolkata to New Delhi. The check-in process was smooth and the baggage handling went well. I later found out as I had a ""Lite"" ticket, which was cheaper, I had to pay extra for my checked baggage. I did that. A bus took us to our aircraft. The plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time. The seats were a bit tight and legroom wasn't that good so I was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight. The head-rest of the seat also wasn't that comfortable. But you know, you can't expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrow-body type. With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle. The plane's air-conditioning had troubles, so it was a bit hot. At last, the plane landed on New Delhi after 2hr 5min. Experience could have been a little better even if it was economy-class.",0
My wife and I flew from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. We were pleasantly surprised how good this low cost airline is. Aircraft is pretty new neat and clean; crew friendly helpful and efficient. Check-in agents at both Singapore and KL were nice and efficient. Nothing was free onboard we bought bottle water and a sandwich. Prices were reasonable. The Low Cost Carrier Terminal took a bit to get used but we had no problem getting help with immigration customs and transportation to city proper. An airline of value!,0
Missed my BNE-CNS flight due to 2hrs holdup in Customs. Must say since I was coming off a SQ flight I didn't expect much help from Jetstar when I arrived 8 minutes after the gate closed but the staff radioed through and did their best to get me on. After it was clear that wasn't going to happen they cheerfully rebooked me for the morning flight and even gave me a front seat which was really nice. As for the flight it was fine staff are great but Jetstar seats always give me a back ache but maybe that's just me.,0
"Bangkok to Manila. FAs at Cebu Pacific are generally nice and smiling. However, during this flight, my husband ordered a warm meal that the FA advised to have a 20-minute-preparation time. Almost an hour later, nothing was served. When we followed up, the crew in fact forgot about it. She apologized and provided us a complimentary sandwich. Food is not good at all with Cebu Pacific, so better bring your own in the aircraft. The croissant sandwich was not a croissant but just a white bread shaped like a croissant and it was not worth the calorie or the price. But I like the aircraft for its staff who are often very nice.",0
"Denpasar to Jakarta. Lion Air is better now, even they still have no free baggage but it suits with the price. The ground staff was very helpful, they print out my boarding pass and gave me front seat. The cabin is clean and comfy, their flight attendant were very helpful. The lavatory is clean. Smooth take off and the flight is on time.",0
"Totally disrespectful to its customers, rescheduling flights many times to many hours from its scheduled time and no solution. It used to be good and punctual, but now avoid this airline at all cost.",1
"I flew Manila to Sydney return on Cebu Pacific's high density A330. The negatives. IFE is non-existent, no personal A/C vent, Pre-ordered meals are horrible, blankets for sale, you're not allowed to bring water on the plane from MNL but its okay from SYD.  I've read about it and knew what to expect.  Check-in agent in Manila was friendly. Seat pitch was good and I'm 6'0"" tall and large built. I still had enough legroom with my knees hardly touching the seat in front of me. In fact, it's much better than their A320's. I was also able to secure an entire 3-seat row to myself on both legs.  Service was friendly, both flights were on time with the MNL-SYD flight actually arriving 30 minutes ahead. If you're flying budget, just know what to expect. Otherwise, fly full service and pay the price.",0
BNK-SYD all good until arrived in Sydney on an outer bay with no air bridge. Apparently an A320 can arrive at the airport on schedule and the ground staff not notice! The captain announced over the pa that the ground staff seemed unaware the aircraft had arrived and he had radioed for stairs so passengers could disembark the aircraft! Travelling on the Qantas group these days is death by a thousand cuts - you never know what service will be cut next - but surely no stairs to disembark the aircraft is taking it a bit far!,1
"This is my return flight from Labuan to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia pride themselves as a low cost airline and indeed the fares are very low. However, yet another delayed flight. No wifi in the aircraft. AirAsia is very strict with carry on cabin baggagge. They will count and weigh every piece of bag. Nothing special about this airline.",1
"So, Jetstar have cancelled my flights twice this year due to covid - which is fair. But, because I accepted a voucher for the original cancellation they're refusing to give me a monetary refund for the second cancellation. Even though the second voucher they provided will expire (March) prior to me being able to leave the state. I also can't use it to fly anywhere in WA because Jetstar doesn't fly anywhere else within WA. Another fun fact on this, they won't reimburse me the difference that I paid for the second set of flights because I used their original voucher. So now I'm stuck with a $400 printed piece of paper. In essence - don't use Jetstar during the pandemic.",1
We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.,1
"I booked a last minute, one way shared flight from Singapore to Perth on Monday January 25th, 2016 with Jetstar Airways as a Qantas frequent flyer. I added the max bundle which gave me 40 kg of luggage, seat choice and lounge access. My check in was done in a unsmiling, perfunctory manner even though there was no queue. The Qantas lounge was wonderful and the highlight of this experience. The seats are standard throughout the plane (small plane, central aisle with three seats either side. My seat was worn vinyl and very uncomfortable. My meal was unappealing and unfortunately the sauce was spilt onto my leg as it was being served. The staff never acknowledged my experience nor offered any apology. My family commute often via Singapore and I will be avoiding this flight from now on if it is serviced by Jetstar.",1
"Flying from Jakarta to Pontianak with Lion Air 737- Max8, and the connected flight to Kuching by Wings Air. Ticket was booked easily, however I could not do mobile check in for Pontianak - Kuching sector. So I have to do check in at counter in the Airport. Both Flights were departed and arrived on time. Pontianak To Kuching was served by ATR 72-600, and i sat at 17A which was really spacious. It was a nice flight.",0
Queenstown to Auckland with Jetstar. JQ send text message about time to web-check and about flight delay 8 hours in advance with no cost. Ground staff very nice. Dedicated queue line boarding for QF FFP member. A very full evening flight but inside the cabin is slightly hot due to sunny weather outside the windows. Lots of airline marketing advertisement audio played during the flight but the highlight is the scenery of Queenstown which is beautiful during takeoff.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Flight was delayed by 6 hours and AirAsia could not accommodate me getting on to another flight. I was travelling for a specific event which I could not miss, so I had to purchase another ticket on another airline at KL airport. AirAsia could not be more unhelpful and told me to go through their AVA chat line to request a refund for my missed flight. I did - only to find out that my case was never recorded. Just tried to process the refund again and ran into technical issues. The ordeal was extremely stressful and expensive, and their customer service is a joke.",1
"First leg of the journey, Hong Kong-Manila, boarded 5J111 and we were delayed for an hour so our 4 hour layover in Manila was now a 3 hour. We landed in Manila and we were waiting to enter the gate but there was no marshall to guide the plane, we had to wait for 15 mins. Next was Manila-Cebu, we waited in the crowded terminal for our flight, we heard over the terminal speakers, that all Cebu Pacific flights were on hold, so I thought to myself, great, we are not leaving for a long time, we were delayed for probaly another hour and when we boarded, we were sitting in our respective seats and we taxied to the runway, there we were probably delayed for half an hour but that was fine, we took off and flew to Cebu. The worst part was that we were not seated together with the family. I would not recommend this airline if you hate delays.",1
"On the return flight from Indore, the check-in of the luggage was done very swiftly as we reached the airport well ahead of departure. The boarding also started well on time. One thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions. Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future. The rating is given based on the safety violation of not stowing away the cabin bags under the seat during takeoff but apart from that the flight and crew were really good.",0
Absolutely appalling experience with Jetstar. Our flights were booked well in advance. We arrived over 2 hours before our flight to be told they have oversold the plane (which they assured us in common practice). We are a group of 3 and the counter staff told us they could accommodate 1 person on the flight and the other would have to fly the following day. Given everyone had children at home and had businesses to run this was not an options. The second solution was to fly to an airport 3 hours from the destination. This was also not an option. The final solution was to fly to an airport 2 hours away later that evening. We asked to speak to a Manager. The staff gave out and told us that they had overbooked flights the previous day and given away our seats to other customers. When we questioned her she shoved her hands in our face and said Im not dealing with this and walked away. No customer service whatsoever and left the junior counter staff to deal with the situation. As jetstar had given away our booked and paid for seats we agreed to 1 person flying on the original flight and the other 2 taking the alternative flyer and being out of pocket for a 2 hour Uber. Then after further delay we were informed they had again made an error and we had now lost our 1 original seat we had been promised. We asked to speak to a manager and out came manager. We thought customer service has bad before she has appalling and extremely rude. She refused to listen and spoke over the top of us. We asked why they didnt give us a courtesy call and she said if its under 2 hours they dont have to and deal with it at the airport. We were there before 2 hours to self check in so this was a lie. She offered to cancel our flights (refund in 14 days) knowing full well that no other airlines had available flights that day. We asked why our seats where given away and we got contradicting answers She really could not care less and was extremely rude. He final response was we should be grateful because she could give us nothing. Clearly staff and process need so revisions,1
Travel from SIN-Qingdao on a Boeing 777. Booked ScootBiz seat and it was more like Economy Plus. Ground crew was slow in checking-in it was a near full flight of over 300 passengers and took almost an hour to clear everyone. Allowing 15kgs cabin baggage is a grave mistake as most passengers on this flight brought in at least 2 pieces of baggage each making the clearance extra slow at the screening area. Those who board plane later had no space left for their baggage. Aircrew was not well trained the worst I've encountered in a budget airline. I could hardly understand the announcement in English with a heavy Japanese accent. Announcement in Mandarin was also below standard.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. I was happy and impressed with AirAsia, the first ever time I am flying Air Asia. The ground service associates was warm and willing to help. The seats were comfortable, enough leg room and very comfortable seat.  The cabin crew are very hospitable and welcoming you all the way. They have been exceptionally professional and willing to listen patiently. The cleanliness of the aircraft is well maintainedl. The value meal I received, was Tandoori Naan wrap which was really tasty. Well Done to AirAsia on ensuring that quality does not suffer although the ticket price is low!",0
Flew Perth to Denpasar on 25th June 2013 on JQ116. My second and last flight with Jetstar. Supposed to depart at 09.30 hrs I awoke at 05.30 hrs to find an SMS stating the flight was delayed 1 hr. Got to the airport and checked in and went through security by 08.00 hrs and waited until 09.30 only to be told flight was again delayed. Come midday again told flight would be delayed to 13.30 hrs. Given a $10 voucher for lunch which doesn't even buy a snack at airport prices. Staff finally opened the gate at 12.50 hrs with a mad scramble to board. Once on board we waited another 45 mins for a 2nd engineer to be found to sign off on the repair. Finally departed at 13.30 hrs and arrived at 17.45 in Denpasar. We paid for a meal on board and never received it - we paid for priority boarding and never got it. Drip-feeding flight delay information is typical of a poor airline operation. I will never fly with them again under any circumstances.,1
Flight JQ458 SYD to Ballina. Sat in seat 5C. The plane took off a few minutes late but landed on time. The flight crew were professional and friendly. Leather seats were very comfortable. Quality of food for purchase onboard not bad.,0
Jetstar Business Melbourne to Beijing. Jetstar is a LCC and the price of their business class tickets is very reasonable. In addition you do not pay a hefty rate for booking a one way ticket as you do with a full service airline. The service was cheerful and competent. The food fine and plenty of drinks on request. I had a middle seat in middle aisle so really the worst seat in business class however it was comfortable and I was able to sleep. The I pad entertainment is limited but then most people load their own I pad before travelling. The young staff were great and the price of the ticket very competitive. If you plan carefully you can often pick up very reasonably priced tickets.,0
"Lion has bad flight management. They changed the schedule so many times without confirmation and I have to cancel my flight then choose another flight for a suitable schedule. Really disappointed, do not use this airline because it is really inconsistent.",1
"Cairns to Sydney. Definitely not recommendable! Unfriendly Staff and we had to pay 60 AUD for 2 Kilo over the weight. You can only carry with only one bag, even a laptop case is not allowed. We couldnt take our coffee for take away with us in the plane. In total we had a really bad flight experience.",1
"Check in 2 hours only 4 desks open resulting in delay off flight delayed by 2 hours. They tried to disguise it as paperwork issues and baggage handling but check in staff gave away the issue due to lack of staff provided by airline. Same excuse used as when we first arrived that they had a problem opening up the baggage hold and tghid cause 1.5 hours of delays. Very little update or info from cabin crew and cockpit communications very limited or non-existent particularly over a duration of 8 hour flight. Right hand front toilet consistently with a queue of 3 to 8 people. I then found out that the left hand front toilet cabin staff were saying it was not in use despite a green light showing. Then when i pushed the matter they admitted that it was reserved for the Captain only. Absolutely unbelievable! The one working right front toilet was a total disgrace, absolutely filthy with no toilet tissue and contaminated water swilling on the floor. During turbulence announcements cabin crew took no action at all to ask the queue for the toilet to return to their seats despite they themselves strapped in ( a major safety issue!). Not even one pot of noodles available during flight and not even any hot drinks at all. Pre ordered food choices were not available and PAX fobbed off with other alternatives of which the quality was lousy. Generally the cabin crew were inattentive and spend a lot of time just sitting down. No pro active action to do more than the very basic. I'm 64 years old Brit, a former pilot and have flown extensively with many airlines both locally and internationally. This was perhaps one of the worst flights in my entire life.",1
"Screaming kids all the way Melbourne to Singapore. Staff did nothing about them toddlers were allowed to run up and down the aisle disturbing other passengers. Bought 3 tickets 6 months ago with assigned seating in row 1. We were all bumped off our seats when we went to check in. Wondering why we were moved from row 1 a very rude staff member barked at me saying ""there are babies on this flight so we need the bassinets seats"". Well on boarding there were no babies in row 1. Seats were cramped and no leg room whatsoever once seat in front is reclined. Audio selection was very poor on some strange ipad type of unit. Beware of Jetstar business class absolutely dreadful.",1
"Taipei to Singapore. Have been calling the Contact Centre for 2 weeks, each day being put on hold for over an hour, to refund my upcoming flights due to the outbreak in CoronaVirus. I informed them that i have travelled through Hong Kong recently and they don't want to help at all. What i get told is that my flight from Taiwan to Singapore i can't get a refund for, but the flight from Singapore to Taiwan i could possibly get a refund. I have logged 3 requests, with supplying all relevant documentation and haven't received any call backs. Instead i need to call every day to find out the process, where i get told something different every day. But at the end not willing to help at all. This is the last time i will consider flying with Scoot.",1
"My flight from Melbourne to Brisbane was cancelled without offering any options for another flight. The e mail stated I will be reimbursed for the hotel When I contacted the airline I was told they would not reimburse me for the hotel because I didn't accept the flight option they gave me. There was no other option. We had to fly with Virgin the next day which cost me and my husband one day of wage pay, the hotel and more expensive tickets for the next day. I am extremely disappointed and will never fly with Jetstar again. Very unreliable airline.",1
"Scoot lost my luggage. I'm told they left it behind in Singapore where I was in transit for 4 hours; was also told on arrival at Sydney airport that it would be on the next available flight and I would get it back within 24-48 hours. Today is the 18th day since those assurances and promises were made I have received nothing but automated replies (the first few days) and zero response since. Frustrated at not being able to deal with a real person, I returned to the airport to chase up at the lost luggage counter after 7 days and I was told no, they never sent it back from Changi Airport. They said they would send a follow-up email to Singapore but if I wanted updates I would again have to call up their support line. And, as you guessed, their support line isn't manned, it drops out when you try to call, and my emails to their support inbox bounce back undeliverable because their ""inbox is full"".",1
Definitely by far the worst airlines I have encountered. Boarded the plane at Manila to go to Caticlan which is supposed to be a 45 min flight. The plane did not leave Manila until 5.5 hours later and still with all passengers on board the plane. Unacceptable excuses provided by the captain and also we were diverted to Kalibo Airport instead. Due to this incident we lost one nights accommodation in Boracay. Pay the extra fees for an airline that you know is reliable.,1
"This is an absolutely disgusting airline, cancelled my flight 1 week to departure.  Now ticket prices are 3x what i bought, you really get what you pay with this kind of airline. Save yourself the headache and get a much reputable main carrier, now I am a firm believer of not using LCC.",1
Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur. The plane departed as scheduled. The lead cabin crew's voice was very clear and was giving announcements very clearly. The flight was a bit bumpy at times but the landing was good. The plane arrived 20 mins ahead of scheduled arrival. The cabin crew were attentive and gave lots of smiling faces.,0
"Christchurch to Auckland. Worst flight experience ever. Both of today's flights were cancelled and I was told I couldn't re-book for 2 days which would have forfeited $1,000's of dollars in plans. To make matters they only offered to refund the price of the ticket without any compensation for the impact on my plans. Instead of cancelling my plans and booking a hotel for 2 nights, I was forced to pay another airline $400 to continue my trip. All of the ticket agents were terrible to deal with indicating they didn't actually work for Jetstar and I'd have to call them for further assistance. After holding for 30 minutes, I hung up and will have to try and resolve after I return from holiday.",1
"Cebu Pacific is so hit and miss. And when it misses, you wait for three additional hours. Do not use this airline, pay the little bit extra for Air Asia or Philippines Airlines Limited (PAL). I've been waiting in the airport since 2pm, and it is now 7pm, and I still have not boarded. The management of this company is hopeless. Aircrew are friendly, but management, my goodness!",1
From checking in to our arrival in Wellington we could not find fault with this airline or its staff. We had a very rough landing in the gales at Wellington and had to go round for a 2nd try. We could not fault the staff during the turbulence. Our bags were out for collection by the time we got to the arrivals area we will be flying Jetstar again in the future.,0
Flew PEK-SIN-DPS with Jetstar Asia and Valuair. Check-in at PEK was terrible with messy lines and no organization I had not picked seats and was separate from my friends. On the PEK-SIN flight crew allowed us to change as it was an empty flight and we got the extra legroom seats which were great the SIN-DPS was full and other seats had terrible legroom although a bun and water was served which is nice all flights were on time.,0
Cairns to Sydney. The ground staff of Jetstar was extremely rude and unprofessional. Poor manners and attitudes. Submitted complaint to Customer Care Team did not reply. Followed up with Live Chat. Not helpful at all. They just tried to brush you off. Obviously they don't care.,1
"I booked Premium Flex with AirAsia from CGK to KUL which were the best seats available on this flight and considerably more than Economy. The price includes a meal which I did not particularly want neither did the two people travelling with me. However a meal came with the flight - I was not impressed with the plastic spoon and fork to eat it with or having to pay extra for a cup of tea. Premium Flex promises Priority Check in and Boarding, at Jakarta there was priority check in but not boarding and boarding was the usual mad rush. On return flight there was no priority Check in or priority boarding. As far as I am concerned I was mis-sold these tickets. I tried AirAsia just to see what they were like as I normally use other airlines and I fly very often many thousands of miles but will never use them again.",1
"Manila to Hanoi. Following a short storm and some disruption there was a delay to the flight of over 4 hours. Cebu Pacific staff failed to apologise, had very little information, appeared to be disorganized and unprofessional and did not inform passengers of their rights. Flights with other airlines appeared to be leaving. In short, shambolic.",1
I flew with AirAsia from Phonm Penh to Phuket via Bangkok and nothing positive to say about this airline. Seating with minimal leg room and they charge for water. The inside of the aircraft is plastered with advertising for one brand of jeans or another. There is no lumbar support in the seats and for tall people the headrest is in the middle of your back. The extra charges apply to everything and baggage is expensive. By the time you add in all of the extras might as well fly with a full far carrier. I will never fly again.,1
"Jaipur to Mumbai. Ticket was booked under corporate fare with meal included. Flight time was 5.20pm and total duration from Jaipur to Mumbai was 1hr 55 min. The cabin crew started serving refreshments at 5.50pm. my seat was 20A. The cabin crew reached my seat at 6.40pm (15 mins prior to landing, the first officer announced landing time of 6.55 pm). The meal was complimentary and being corporate meal it should have been ready but the cabin crew member said she will get back to me with chicken sandwich which she never came back. She even refused to serve anything hot (beverage and/or meal) to me and few other passengers on seats nearby my seat since we were near to landing time. How was it passengers fault that meal was served or about to be served at time of landing. I raised this issue with the cabin crew head and all I got as meal after landing while getting out of aircraft was a box of cashew nuts.",1
Unfortunately I travelled with Jetstar over the long weekend as it was cheaper than other airlines. It was ridiculous - so chaotic unorganised and there were no staff at any of the gates. Firstly my online check-in was not working so I called their help desk and the lady on the phone was not even listening to what I was saying. On my return flight there was no identification of the flight number or time at the gate gate changes over the speaker that were incorrect nor any staff there to help with any queries. Both flights were extremely delayed and the flight crew were not helpful. Bags were moved by the flight crew and they did not inform the passengers. It took over 35 minutes to board the plane. The most annoying part about the whole thing was that the lines to board were crazy - we were told to line up once we were all lined up and waiting in line they decided to change the way in which to board to seat 19-37 first. On both my flights the flight hostesses were rude very unhelpful and kept hitting the back of my seat without apologising. I would never fly Jetstar again it was an awful experience. It was not smooth easy or stress free. My flight outbound had a huge delay - 1.5 hours and I was not informed by sms nor email or a phone call.,1
"Perth to Melbourne. The filthiest plane I have ever been on. The seats weren't even brushed for crumbs and sand. There's also absolutely no room for your small carry on items, not even a water bottle or purse. Extremely long wait at every point of checking in and boarding. Will never fly with this carrier again, not worth the small money savings.",1
"Jetstar Airways flight from Honolulu to Sydney on January 28th 2016, due to arrive in Sydney on Jan 29th at 3 pm. We were due to board at about 8 am, after being queued in the longest queue to check in (hundreds of metres long) and then walking to the Jetstar lounge which was not opened for ages. Just about to get onto the aircraft when there is an announcement that the ""flight is cancelled due to engine issues"". Immediately there are text messages to our phone confirming the flight cancellation and giving advice about contacting airline for a refund. That was the last communication I got from Jetstar. If I had waited for them to contact me I would still be sitting in Honolulu. Shipped off en masse to the airport hotel, with vouchers for $30 worth of food per person per day (which gets you about one course in Honolulu). The buses or taxis which never seemed to arrive, and we get there about 2 hours later after collecting our luggage and lining up like a flock of sheep on the sidewalk. We sit in our hotel for the best part of 2 days. No communication from Jetstar. Jetstar extends our time in the hotel for an extra day. No news about what is wrong with their plane our how long it will be till it is fixed. No suggestion of any replacement aircraft or switching us to Qantas or Hawaiian. When I go back to the airport I am told they be able to get you on a flight on about the 3rd or 4th of February. I go back to the hotel, manage to eventually book a flight with Air New Zealand to Auckland, then to Sydney with Qantas. We finally get back to Sydney on January 31st in the afternoon. Still have not heard a word from Jetstar. They probably still think we are in the airport hotel.",1
Flew Gold Coast to Singapore with Scoot. Was fine. I'm 6'2 (188cm) plenty of leg room. I read so many bad reviews here - people complain about not having what they didn't pay for. This is a good no frills flight on a modern plane and its run well. For the price I highly recommend it. Can't comment on the food.,0
"Manila to Cebu. Cebu Pacific has improved on some points I had issues with in the past. For one, there was no delay, flight actually arrived on the destination earlier than scheduled. And online processing of booking was easier.",0
"I flew from Singapore Changi to Sydney on 12/2/18. What a mistake. The queue at Changi was horrendous - we waited 2-3 hours with minimal desks open and like a cattle market. The plane was basic, no screens, no ability to purchase wifi on computer - but you'd forgive this as it's budget. But stocking enough food for the flight is basic, and did not happen. Landed at Sydney and my luggage did not come. 5 other people were affected. It's a direct flight, how do you lose luggage? They made me a property irregularity sheet (with no reference number) and simply said wait till we contact you. I had no clothes, no belongings for 3 days. You ring the customer services and you can't get through, if you do they cut you off (happened twice) because they can't be bothered or may be they are trained to do it. They eventually returned me my luggage but no offer of compensation, nothing.",1
"Booked a flight from Brisbane to Tokyo for the end of March. Within a month, the flight itinerary changed three times. At first the changes were only be a few minutes. Then I received a change a few days (dates before and/or after the original booking). I do not live in Brisbane, which means I would have had to either pay to change my connecting flights, or pay for several nights accommodation. Also, it affects my Tokyo accommodation. Due to the frequent changes, I could not gamble on whether Jetstar would stick with the new proposed dates or suddenly switch them again. I understand that flights are set to change, and this is forewarned upon booking but the sheer frequency and drastic shifts are unsettling - especially being so close to the departure dates. I requested a refund, which I was permitted. Then followed up by filing a complaint. The complaint was handled by automated sympathy messages and a declaration that it is not Jetstars responsibility as it is already outlined in the policy. These changes can end up costing travelings severely to change flights, book and rearrange accommodations, and other expenses.",1
"Melbourne to Hamilton Island via Sydney. Worst airline Ive ever traveled on. Been on so many budget airlines before and this is by far the worst, have queues hundreds of metres long with little staff (less than 4) to check everyone in and most staff are rude. Quite literally never been on a flight with them with no hassles.",1
"After our first flight from Bengaluru to Indore, we had our second flight (Indore to Udaipur) canceled by the company. The only possibilities: to be reimbursed and stay on site in transit without nothing to do or to reach Delhi at 5pm, to stay in a hotel with meals and pick up and drop off included, before having a flight to our final destination the next morning. Finally the flight to Delhi was at 11pm! Arrival on site: no staff aware of the situation. We waited 3 hours in the middle of the night in front of the counter then we slept the remaining 2 hours in front of the boarding gate on the floor. Contract not fulfilled by the company. We are now appealing: no response to our emails and our calls. After threatening to escalate the information, we are offered compensation of 500rp (its a joke!) because ""we chose to take the flight"". Yes, we chose this option, we did not choose the lie of the company and their lack of professionalism.",1
"Phuket-Chiang Mai Economy. Air Asia is riding the budget airline wave and doing a reasonable job of it. We ordered some food when we booked (Pancakes and Satay) which turned out to be decent. Everything went smoothly and on time. My only grief was how tightly packed the seats are onboard. I'm 6'1"" and used to being a bit squished on airlines. These seats were the worst I'd ever been on without question. In our case the flight was a little over an hour and we had the row to ourselves to spread out. I would never book this airline for longer legs with more passengers.",0
"Hong Kong to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur. During 4 legs of my journey, 3 are delayed. As we rush in the airport to go to the next leg, there is no notice about our next flight being delayed thus prompting us to rush even though we should not need to rush. During the delay, there is no compensation. The flight attendants is far from friendly. They seem to be more apt at ordering people around. The seating is cramped. They wanted all electronics to be switched off, not just on airplane mode during take off and landing.",1
Phuket to Melbourne. 787 Dreamliner. Had flown on Qatar's 787 Business Class so had high expectation leading into this flight and was disappointed. Seat 1F - which was in a row of 3 when I checked in on-line the seats next to me were free but at check-in they agent advised these seats were now taken. I had asked if I could move to 3G/H but was told these were reserved for crew! I had read online that these were the best seats with more recline what's the point of having them if they are only for crew - seems pointless! Seat config of 2-3-2. For business class I don't understand the point of a row of 3 seats. Seat comfort was ok but impossible to sleep in. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Dinner was ok - Soup for starter which was tasteless Main was very tasty which was stir fry steak. Was accompanied with a 'salad' which was a couple of lettuce leaves in a bowl. Wine choice good. Entertainment system ok - had a couple of new release movies and some recent TV shows but quite limited. Overall it was good value for money but I'd hardly call this Business Class. I don't see why Jetstar wouldn't invest in putting in slightly bigger seats with more recline especially when the majority of their flights on the way back to Australia are red eye and the current seats are impossible to sleep in comfortably.,0
"Manila to Cebu, I waited at the gate for around 2 hours, since I arrived early. The problem started, at boarding time, which was suppose to be 740pm. The ground crew announces, instead of 119 boarding will be at 120! It turned out to be a chaotic ordeal everyone. Another gripe is with carry on luggage, rule is 1 carry-on luggage per person, 7kg carry-on plus a small personal item such as a handbag, or a small backpack. But they allowed people to board with a Carry-on plus another more than 7kg bag. And to my surprise, even the forward bins where occupied by people who had brought more luggage than it is permitted. I specifically got the 2nd row of seats, so I could get enough space for my 1 carry-on but the FA allowed people to use the bins, even though they had been seated in the middle cabin.  I had to stow my bags under the seat in front of me. It is a budget airline, but come on Cebu Pacific, improve your service.",1
Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney via Singapore. Very bad airline. The flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore delayed significantly as a result we missed the connection flight from Singapore to Sydney. In total we wasted 7 hours and had to pay a lot for meal and transport re-arrangement fee. Jetstar has no policy to pay compensation for delayed flight. Already knew this is very bad service that is why booking through Qantas but Qantas refuse to pay any compensation and ask to contact Jetstar.,1
Perth to Cairns return. Would not recommend Jetstar - the only reason we went on it is because no other airline flies direct to Cairns. It all started before we even got on the plane. Could not check in after driving for 5 hours from the country. Jetstar only do check in's 2 hours prior to flights which means a massive line and wait. Get on the plane and the seats are ridiculously small and had quite a large man on one side of me and the passenger in front reclined their chair. Very uncomfortable. The only positive was the Jetstar staff were very good and caring. The return flight wasn't as bad didn't seem as cramped but was on an aisle seat.,1
"Sydney to Auckland. I booked a ticket once and will never do that again. My flight was cancelled and they could not offer me an alternative flight to my destination. They have a hotel booking service. However, they refused to issue me a refund that I can use to book for hotels. I am not Australian and I don't live in Australia so there is zero use for me to use their voucher for Australian tickets. I wasted 850 dollars from my money and they refused to let me use it for hotel booking and could not offer flights for my requested destinations. Not even cooperative. Their reply was that the vouchers are automatically generated although I bought a refundable expensive ticket from them.",1
"This airline used to be good. However, they have degrading in most of the aspects. Customer experience has taken a nose dive. Recently, I have booked flight from Bangalore to Chandigarh. That got cancelled. Post that I booked a flight to Delhi and have made alternate arrangements to reach Chandigarh. But alas! They rescheduled it again by another hour. This resulted in the snowball effect and my plan which was already impacted due to earlier cancellation. Got impacted again. When I tried to explain this to staff on ground, they could not care less. Such a sad turn of events for an airline which was most trusted.",1
"On April 26, I flew ADL-HBA with Jetstar. I wasnt expecting too much in the way of good service given the flights $55 price tag (before plus bundle), but I was pleasantly surprised from the outset. Although Adelaide Airports check in is now automated for all airlines, the girl at the kiosks managed to upgrade my friend and I to exit row seats at no extra charge. Service onboard was surprisingly delightful, and I would happily do it all again. Return leg from HBA-ADL was equally brilliant, and despite being stuck in a holding pattern delaying our landing for some 30 minutes, the crew did their best to ensure a seamless flight for all. Overall, a terrific experience.",0
"Quick check-in when first using the electronic check-in before using the computer. Unfortunately cannot print out the AirAsia boarding cards or use smart phone as check-in, but machines work quickly and it beats standing in line. Crew on board friendly, and the seats in row 1, and exit row are comfortable enough for a few hours. Flights on schedules. Only complaint is that while alcoholic beverages are advertised they appear often not to be available on Air Asia. Also tried to pay in Indonesian Rupiah from Bali and exchange rate was approx. 50% of the actual!",0
"I flew from Singapore to Melbourne without any problems so some of the ratings below refer to that flight. However, Scoot's organisational abilities and customer service leave a huge amount to be desired. I had a Scoot booking to fly by Virgin from Canberra to Sydney and by Scoot to Singapore, to connect with a separate flight to London. Scoot changed the flight departure time but didn't tell Virgin so I was not allowed to board the flight. After hours of phone calls from the airport the only solution was to catch a Singapore Airlines flight for over AUD $1,500. They insisted that I had to pay for it myself because (despite being a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines) they were not able to, and they promised they would repay it. Four weeks later they still claim to be checking the paperwork.",1
We flew BLR-KUL-CLARK in July-Aug and were pleasantly surprised at the level of service offered by AirAsia. We went in fearing worst after reading reviews about the airline and also about the LCCT in KL. However we came back fully satisfied with AirAsia's service and the amenities offered at LCCT. You really cannot expect more for the fares on offer and it wasn't as if there was a dearth of choices. Both airline and terminals were perfectly serviceable. My only suggestion to AirAsia would be to offer at least one vegetarian food choice on non-India routes.,0
"Auckland to Christchurch with Jetstar Airways, the first flight in the morning at 6.10 am ready for boarding and flight cancelled. First time in my life I have just been given us a fotocopy paper saying I am sorry, asked for compensation. They did not even put us on the next flight, only on the third one, and we were stranded 6 hours in the airport not even a meal voucher, when others had. Very bad, bad service.",1
BKK-MNL. Flight left 1 hour late though that was beneficial to me. Staff really pleasant and helpful. Plane was clean and cabin announcements clear in both English and Filipino (sometimes I can never hear what's being said). Legroom bad but not unexpected for an economy airline. Food prices very reasonable at about 80p - 1.20 for soft drinks and the same again for snacks. 5 for a meal but didn't try. Only grumble is the shocking seat reclining pitch. If the passenger in front reclines then you can't even bring your tray down. It was a nightmare. Had to hold drinks in my hands in 20 years of flying never known anything like it!,0
"Jambi to Jakarta. Lion Air is infamous for delays. I took this flight because this was the lowest price and the most suitable schedule. The flight was okay, surprisingly no delay, but the FA was not hospitable. no IFE or inflight meal for purchase, maybe because it was just a short flight.",1
BKK-Penang return. Asked and paid for assistance as have problems walking and needed a wheelchair. Had a chair on the outward trip as far as the bus then left to struggle on and off the bus on my own and to climb up to the aircraft. At Penang Airport had chair but had to walk up 2 flights of steps. The return was not too bad till got to Bangkok - no chair waiting the air hostess tried to ring for a chair but nobody answered the phone. Had to walk whole way through the airport with great difficulty and then collect my luggage. By the time I got to arrivals to meet my daughter I could hardly walk and was in a great deal of pain. Will never travel Air Asia again alone.,1
"I flew with Cebu Pacific from Manila to Boracay MPH, which was a much quicker option. I was hesitant to book as reviews were claiming poor service, cancelled flights and delays. I can't speak highly enough of the airline. Check in smooth, Aircraft was brand new and they tried to keep passengers entertained through the short hour or so flight.",0
"Singapore to Bangkok. Our initial flight from BKK to SIN were also delayed. The problem with they delay was that they were not honest with how badly the flight would be delayed. For our flight from BKK to SIN, we were told that the delay would only be 30 minutes, but it ended up being a 1.5 hour delay. The plane was filthy because they didn't have time to clean it properly. My tray table had coffee stains, it was sticky, and the toilets stank to high heavens. A stewardess on the flight told a passenger who had an onward flight from SIN to Australia that the flight to Australia would be re-timed for their sake as there were 7 of them on the flight. On our flight back from SIN to BKK, the flight was re-timed for 2 hours later. We were only told when we arrived at the airport. One wonders if my flight was delayed because other flights into SIN were delayed, and as a result, they delayed other connecting flights so they wouldn't have to put them on other planes. A terrible experience. Our seats on the last row could not recline at all.",1
"This review is about their customer service. I had a problem booking tickets online and called immediately. Their customer service not only tried to make it seem like they didn't speak English or understand what I was saying, but proceeded to give me the run around, and put me on hold 5 times. I was on the phone for over an hour. I called again and I requested to speak to a Manager, and could not even get the name of the Manager on, or get transferred to him for another 45 minutes. Once speaking to the Manager, he explained to me that the company does not hold any responsibility for anything that happens on their website and that he would not do anything at all to try to help me with my frustration and distress. Please be very careful booking through this agency. The customer service is not there to help you.",1
"I booked a flight from CRK to HKG with Tiger air on 1 March and from then on things rapidly went downhill. On 11 March I received an e-mail from Tiger air telling me that my early morning flight was now an evening departure. On 20 March a further e-mail arrived telling me my booking reference was now a new Cebu Pacific one and any inquiries were to be directed to them. I found that I was now unable to check-in online and had to do this at the airport. Come departure time there is no sign of the flight. No announcements had been made so I went to the inquiry desk to see four members of staff staring intently at their I-phones. I was informed that the aircraft was on its way and would be here in 30 minutes. One and a half hours late we finally departed. No announcements from the flight deck for the duration of the journey and no apologies received from the cabin staff. On the return flight I went to Terminal 1 as per my flight itinerary only to be told ""no it's terminal 2"".",1
"It is low price with low-quality service so far. I used ZIPAIR twice because it was cheaper than any other airline and it is based on a Japanese company.  I experienced multiple uncomfortable moments.  We couldn't get TSA Pre-approved ticket. . As a result, we couldn't go through TSA line. When landed at Narita airport, a flight attendant asked us to leave soon when we were still making sure we didn't leave anything around our seat. Yes, we were one of the last people. Our luggage was not by our seat, so we needed to wait for others to leave first. I used to travel 4-6 times a year. I used many different airlines. But, it was my first time being asked to leave soon.  Wifi connection was disconnected multiple times. Low quality and poor connection. No free meal:  No screen and movies: That's okay. As long as I have WIFI connection. The selection of movies was out-dated. Extra cost for check-in luggage: You pay more for heavier luggage. That's okay it is still money-saving. Well, do I recommend Zipair? Yes for money saving with accepting low quality service.",0
"AA has gone from bad to worse, if that is possible! Tried to change flights due to a visa issue but the only form of interaction is with AVA - an auto-bot with limited information. I have been trying to reschedule for over 2 hours now without any success. This is tantamount to fraud and scam - AirAsia is essentially robbing us of our money. I will never book through AirAsia again. If the airline is unable to provide an adequate customer service, the whole outfit should just close shop or sell to a party better able to run the airline. What a waste of money!",1
SIN-CGK on new B737-900. Booking was good website efficient and easy. Flight was delayed for about 45 minutes without any notice. During take off and landing there is one passenger who never set his seat upright and FAs don't bother to remind him. Seat pitch very poor. Baggage claim at CGK is a havoc. Baggage carousel is changed without any notice and a very long time to have your baggage on the belt.,1
I flew Cebu last July from Manila - Cebu and back. I have nothing but praise for the airline. The return trip could have been a nightmare as I needed to get to Manila for connecting flight to Schiphol. My scheduled flight was delayed for some hours due to impending typhoon and I would have missed the connection. The wonderful staff at the desk pulled out all the stops and got me on the earlier flight with minutes to spare. I got on board just as doors were closing and made my connection in Manila. I cannot imagine this happening anywhere else.,0
"Overall I would definitely recommend choosing Jetstar's business class as the cost quite reasonable. It was must be my lucky day as the plane arrived on time to Denpasar. The downside is I was unable to do online check-in. Fortunately, there was no queue for business class check-in. The cabin and toilet was clean & fresh, up to standard. Seat comfort was okay, but it could have been comfier. Food and beverage was good, but it would be better if they separate the dessert time. Not put at the same tray on main course. This could provide better enjoyment as it is served together with tea and coffee. In addition, the appetizer was disappointing as it was only served a pack of pretzel instead of proper meal. Despite of 3-course dining not being perfect, cabin staff service was prompt and excellent. As they noticed I did not request extra beverage, they were proactive to offer me more snacks and drinks.",0
"Singapore to Perth. Awful customer service. Awful food, so overpriced, but portion so small and Nasi Lemak was filled with sweet sauces rather than actual ingredients. Seat had a missing recliner button, and when I sent in feedback all I was told was they ""checked and there was nothing wrong with the seat"". Insinuating that I was making things up, instead of giving me the benefit of the doubt. Very interesting how this could be when the button as missing from the seat! I even sent in a photo of the evidence showing the button missing. They ignored my e-mails thereafter even though I repeatedly e-mailed to ask for a follow-up. They clearly do not value customer service, so I will be switching loyalties.",1
"Bangkok to Manila. After a positive experience on my last Manila to Bangkok flight this was back to true 5J form. The flight was late by one hour, the explanation was the usual stupid ""late arrival of turnaround aircraft"", with no reason given for that late arrival. There was no information given at check-in about the delay, only the airport monitors started showing it. In flight it took the cabin crew 1 hour to finally offer food and drinks and then no Sandwiches or any other fresh food was available, only cup noodles. ""Sold out sir"". As usual. After 2 hours the toilets were soiled but never cleaned by the fa's. Upon arrival they added to everybody's delay by parking the plane at one of the bays most far away from immigration.",1
"Pretty disappointed with Cebu Pacific's customer service. I had to cut my holiday short due to the Taal volcano eruption just over 3 weeks ago. We had safety concerns around this high rating and did not feel comfortable with the ash in the air and the flights being cancelled. When I explained that the natural disaster had cut our trip short, Cebu Pacific refused my request for refund with a short and blunt email, a week after I emailed them for assistance. They were very misleading in not sending any information on getting the government tax back which I am 100% entitled to,  luckily I had done my own research. It has been three weeks and I am still waiting for my government tax refund request to be reviewed .. a tiny $50AUD return on a $500 flight that I couldn't take because of serious safety concerns. Very disappointed in Cebu Pacific and won't be choosing them again.",1
PEN-SIN on a very new A320. Pre selected seat in the first row (1D) as I wanted to have a fast clearance out of Changi Airport. Aircraft was pushed back 10 minutes before ETD and arrived SIN 20 mins earlier than ETA. Efficient cabin crew.,0
"Scoot cancelling or changing planes without letting their customers know. We booked 4 tickets in December for a flight from Singapore to Perth on 30 April. Unknown to me Scoot's booking system was apparently still in ""summer mode"" and Scoot changed to ""winter mode"" which mean that our flight was cancelled. Scoot claims that they have let me know via email that our flights changed but I never received the email. The SMS they apparently sent to my work mobile did, not even came up in a search of my phone records. I had to purchase a last minute very expensive flight on Qantas because Scoot messed up, however when I asked them to refund my expense they claim that they have a no refund policy. Be careful to book with Scoot, this flight cost us 8x more than planned and our complaints were met with a no responsibility and no care attitude.",1
We had better service with Scoot than on full cost airlines the planes were clean and the cabin staff attentive. Paid extra for yellow seats at rear of plane and would do so again. No complaints whatsoever and we will definitely fly Scoot again.,0
"My flights actual departure was 1 hour late, but the airline said nothing about the delay. Passengers were confused and tired waiting at the gate. On our ticket, the departure gate was D3. But without any announcement, the gate was changed to D7. I almost boarded the wrong flight (the flight from D3 was JT22, but my flight was JT42. Both heading to Denpasar, but JT22 delayed for 3 hours.). After boarding, there were 2 passengers yelling and arguing because their seat was the same. Poor communications is not only a Lion Air problem. Poor ground management, poor baggage handling, and many more problems await you if you book your flight with Lion Air.",1
The most unreliable airline in Australia. I will never fly with this airline again. Flight to Sydney was delayed by two hours this morning due to a minor technical problem and flight back home was cancelled just as I got to airport. My whole day was thrown into chaos as a result and had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Virgin to ensure I made it back home for a very important engagement. For anyone considering flying with Jetstar?  Its worth paying a little extra with a more reliable airline such as Virgin or Qantas.,1
PER-SIN-PER just after Christmas as the fares were incredibly cheap (less than $850 for three people to SIN and back). Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot. I was actually surprised that something so bad could actually come from Singapore. Only recommended on the basis of price.,0
"Absolutely horrible airline, and not that much cheaper than other budget flights. Lion Air first delayed my 12pm flight from Lombok to Jakarta by two hours, then delayed it again to 3.40pm, but we didnt even manage to board until 4.45pm. I should have read the other reviews before booking this; they are awful and far and away the worst budget airline Ive flown in Asia. AirAsia, Vietjet, etc are far superior.",1
"I booked but because of COVID could not travel. Scoot promised refunds in 20 days in these conditions, but have not refunded or replied to me. I have started a chargeback procedure and will never choose them again, they really sully the Singapore Airlines brand. If any reps from Scoot lurk here, Im still awaiting my refund!",1
Fly every few months from Bangkok to Singapore using Scoot the service is always excellent boarding is always on time check in is always easy and most importantly they're always the cheapest airline I can find even when other airlines have promotions Scoot are cheaper. As expected food is expensive and there's little in-flight entertainment apart from Wi-fi (which I got free!) but it's a low cost airline I don't expect it. I just bring a book or iPad. I always fly with Scoot and always recommend Scoot.,0
"Singapore to Berlin booked via Kiwi.com. We booked meal for 2 on this 14 hour flight and paid extra. We did not receive our meals and when I asked why not the stewardess said : it is not on your boarding pass, contact Kiwi. We did not even get free water to drink on this long flight.",1
"Horrible experience. I booked two round trip tickets from LA -> Tokyo and Singapore -> Tokyo. Of these four flights, three were delayed (by 2, 3, and 6 hours) and one was canceled a week prior.  On the flight back to LA, they failed at connecting the passenger bridge for 40 minutes and we had to disembark on the tarmac,",1
"My elderly mother was to have traveled from Auckland to Melbourne last night 3/3/19. For some reason she ended up at the wrong departure lounge and subsequently missed her flight. She did not have her phone with her and did not hear the airline paging her so she sat and waited. My sister received a call from Jetstar asking if our mother had gone through customs/security. We were shocked and extremely worried for her safety and whereabouts. I made a call to the Auckland Airport and spoke to a lovely staff who was professional and empathetic in our conversation. I was put through to another very helpful lass  at Jetstar. With staff out looking, she was eventually located. Story ends. Jetstar offered our mother dinner, provided her with accommodation and put her on the same flight the very next evening. Thank you so very much to all those involved. You've restored my faith in human kindness.",0
"I don't know where to begin! We paid extra for extra legroom, but a few days before our flight, I checked our booking and saw we had been moved to a normal seat! I called Jetstar and had it changed back, but then when we went to check in at the airport, they had given our seats to someone else! So not only did we not get the seats we paid for, we also didn't get to sit together! On the flight, the key issues include extremely hard and uncomfortable seats, very little to no legroom, no inflight entertainment, the worst food I have ever had the misfortune of eating, and an absolutely full plane. It is still a 6.5 hour flight, so some comfort would be welcomed! There isn't even a business class option or premium economy. Seriously and in all honesty, our Murray's bus to Sydney was far more comfortable. I will never fly Jetstar again - ever!",1
"I am very upset by the staff. I have never had a problem with my carry-ons fitting in the cabin, etc., and I have traveled on 10-12 domestic Australian flights in the last 2 months. But today they took my carry-on out of my hands in the boarding line, said it was too big, and made me pay $60 to check it. I am irate. The way it was handled was very degrading and upsetting. I will not be traveling with Jetstar in the future, not ever again.",1
My family and I (group of 5) flew PNH-KLIA2-PNH in November 2014. The PNH-KLIA2 flight was almost full and the KLIA2-PNH flight was completely full. Having been a regular AA and AAX flyer since 2006 we knew what to expect - value for money. Our expectations were kept at a reasonable level and once again we were not disappointed. Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude. A few ground staff at the old LCCT had a poor command of English. On balance though in my 8 years of flying on AA and AAX I have found AA and AAX to be good to excellent.,0
"It was my first flight, so I was very excited for it. And I have to say that it didn't disappoint me at all. The crew were very kind and generous. Air vents were also well placed and the ambience was also good. It is very affordable. The members explained us the rules properly.  One of the best and affordable airline company in India.",0
Brisbane to Cairns. Flight was cancelled the morning of the flight. Only offer was a flight arriving after midnight - which with 2 young children and an elderly 74 yo isn't ideal. Wouldnt offer any form of assistance with lounge access or anything. I have had similar situations with other airlines but they at least assisted with something. The answer from Jetstar - your booking package gets you nothing basically. Just feeling let down as I know its about airline profit.,1
"Will never fly with Jetstar again. We almost missed our flight because the lady at the counter messed everything up even though I had checked in online. After that I couldn't get a boarding pass because the lady wasted too much time and the system said it was closed! The lady just said we had to buy tickets for the next flight! Ridiculous! Luckily we did the check in online and the staff at the airport helped us. The cabin crew were not helpful at all and gave really bad service. Had to call 2 to 3 times just to ask for a cup of water! When we were exiting the aircraft I had my cellphone in my hand and I did not even look at it, a crew member shouted at me and told me to put my phone down! I said I wasn't even using it, he threatened that I would be fined if I still had it in my hand! Jetstar NZ just ruined my trip. Never flying with this ridiculous company again.",1
Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off.,1
"Business Class with a budget carrier, but you would hardly have noticed with the excellent customer service. Champagne before take-off with a follow up choice of drinks. The meal range was quite good and the food was barely recognisable as airline food. The seats were certainly comfortable enough. The only downsides I could think of was a lack of available movies to watch and there was no priority boarding. Other than these small issues, the flight was a credit to the airline.",0
Indigo from Mumbai to Goa and return. Flights were packed on both legs. We got emergency exit seats both ways as we asked for them. Great leg room and worth it for the 1 hour flight. Both flights on time. Service good. Planes are clean and they look new unlike many ageing Indian carriers. Value for money.,0
Delayed for more than 2 hours. The boarding experience was a nightmare. Delay announcement via sms and flight announcement display. My in-flight experience are the same as my previous flight - very moderate.,1
"I booked a ticket Bangkok to Singapore return at the same time from the Scoot website. As I normally do I checked the spelling of my name and the dates to make sure I hadn't made any mistakes and then paid by Visa. I checked to see which airport it flew from as there are 2 airports in Bangkok, most low cost airlines fly from Don Meauang Airport but some are located at Suvarnabhumi. I noted that this flight took for from Suvarnabhumi Airport. What I didn't check was the airline that the return flight landed in. This turned out to be Don Meauang. Yes, this was shown on the itinerary but I think it's a bit misleading. I never expected it to be a different airport and from reading complaints online a lot of people are thinking the same as me. I ended up having to pay for a taxi at Midnight on the return date to get to my car (40 minutes away). When I called Scoot to complain they were polite but said that it's my responsibility to know which airline the flight arrives at. Needless to say I'm not pleased by that type of response and Scoot will now be my last choice for air travel. They can't be trusted.",1
I was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible! Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.,1
Trivandrum to Bangalore. Airline provided special consideration to families with small kids so we also got the preference on boarding the flight first. The kids were provided with small Indigo passports by the hostess. The Kids and we as a family enjoyed the flight. We were provided with soft drinks and in one hour we landed at the Bangalore Airport. It was a good customer service from Indigo,0
"My wife and my son (1.5 years) took a domestic flight today from manila to bohol in the Philippines. Obviously she had luggage of 30kg prebooked, my son was not allowed to have his own luggage for checkin. My wife had to pay his luggage of 30 kg PER kg, which means 10800 PHP=200 USD.  You just lost a client of the past 6 years.",1
Dubai - Manila - CDO on 16 December. Flight was very basic food was poor minimal and overpriced. No inflight entertainment staff were correct but seemed more interested in chatting to each other. My seat was near the emergency exit so enough foot space but due the freezing air leaking through the door far from pleasant. Transit in Manila was ok although in Dubai we were advised by Cebu Pacific to collect and transport our luggage ourselves. Totally unnecessarily and did pressure our short transit time of 90 minutes. On departure at CDO a very friendly counter staff member gave us a some VIP treatment prepared all OWF papers of my wife managed to transit our luggage by Cebu Pacific itself because the very short transit time in Manila (from T3 TigerAir to T4 Cebu Pacific in 90minutes!) and gave us both seats in the front-row. The flight from Manila to Dubai was very bumpy and unpleasant so Cebu Pacific has it's pro's and cons.,0
Kolkata to Bangalore. Excellent service! Very touched with prompt service. Well done. Hope you keep your service up. Very touched that my tea was replaced with a fresh cup. The cabin crew was very polite.,0
Flight from KUL-HAN was on time. The check in was smooth through until boarding. Aircraft's parked far away from our boarding gate. We walked more than 300 metres. Seat comfort and leg room are extremely poor. Staff were nice. However on our return trip from Hanoi a male crew was standing like a poster man. Neither instructed to ease the boarding flow nor helping a nanny who was holding her grandson to stow her hand luggage. Low cost airline shouldn't mean low cost in assisting passengers who need help.,1
"They use to be quite good. However, lady at the Sydney domestic service desk said wont be allowed on our flights if we dont pay $50 for being 1 kg over our allowance via eftpos. I opted for a cash payment.  Worth mentioning we booked seats for row 11 but were assigned seats in row 30.",1
"Sharing my horrible customer experience trying first time to book on SCOOT for a VTL flight Berlin-Singapore for my family (2 adults & 2 kids). During the booking process I was offered the possibility to redeem my KrisFlyer miles to pay part of the fare and I chose this option. Unluckily for me, the payment part went through but KrisFlyer miles redemption part failed due tech issue. After many emails and calls to customer service promising the resolution by end of the day each day, 5 days later and 4 days before the flight I still have an unconfirmed ticket with no assurance that either I will be issued the ticket and miles deducted (non-refundable!) or that the ticket will not be issued and I need to book alternative flights for my family to return to Singapore. Needless to say that during COVID times when approvals, PCR tests etc need to be planned well in advance, this adds additional pressure and stress to already difficult situation.",1
Flew OOL-SIN and SIN-TSN return was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the trip. It is a budget airline so you can not expect all the bells and whistles. All aircraft's were fresh and new with a young aircrew to boot. They seemed in good spirits and helpful. Naturally the food service was basic but not too expensive compared to some other budget carriers I have flown with. Surprisingly I was placed in a yellow stretched seat but while the seating did have more leg room the lack of adjustable headrest did not make it too much better. All in all though I would not hesitate to re-book a flight with them. No Inflight entertainment was available but I did not intend of using the pay service anyway.,0
"If you can, choose another airline! This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown in my 5 years living in Asia. It was terrible from the booking process and through the whole experience. When booking, the website didnt work and customer service was useless. 5 phone calls and 4 attempts online I finally got a flight. Then, the price was increased. When I finally got the air airport, the staff was clueless.  Once on the plane, we waited for over an hour without air conditioning or staff telling us why we are delayed.",1
"Was assigned last two row at seat 39F with their new A321NEO aircraft. The seat pitch is generous and comfortable. Delayed one hour due to late arriving aircraft from SIN. The flight was full. I just realized after the FA perform the safety demonstration, because we have a long taxi to runway 33 KUL, duo FA nonstop chatting loud at back galley. Their inflight portal scoothub also cant connect.",0
"I flew Soot Plus (slightly better than economy) on 24 July 2022 from Singapore to Gold Coast. This fare is more than three times the price of a standard seat as it is more spacious, greater reclining capability and a footrest. When I boarded the plane, there were two Defect notices (see attached) on my seat indicating that: 1. the reclining mechanism was defective and the seat would not tilt. 2. the head rest was defective and not operational. From 10:00pm until about 8:00am (an 8 hour period allowing for local time) I had to sit in a fully upright position in this seat with the defective ripped headrest that could only be partially used. I appreciate that the plane was fully booked and therefore I could not be moved to another seat. Cabin crew told me with sincerity that they would submit a report on the problem. It has now been just short of 4 months since I lodged my complaint to Scoot with no offering of a resolution. I have contacted Scoot on 2 occasions (which is a near impossible feat) since July and was told that it would be processed within a week. It is a direct deliberate lie? I have since written to the parent company Singapore Airline. They did not respond. If flying Between Australia and Asia do not fly Scoot. They are near impossible to contact and they do not care. And there is no complaint mechanism within Australia. A bargain is a bargain until you get stung. I have just contacted Scoot again and they have advised me that the case is closed. They haven't even reviewed or contacted me.  All complaints are just closed as they are received.",1
"I have not booked a flight with Cebu Pacific in over ten years, since I was denied boarding in Dumaguete City. At that time, the company could not comprehend credit card payments. Then, in April 2023, I decided to give them another try. After waiting in a chaotic line for over an hour, I was told that I must pay again at the counter for my fare to Manila. I presented my payment receipt and itinerary to the counter agent who informed me that he was unable to verify my credit card payment. I then showed my credit card statement with the charge highlighted. He demanded cash payment again.",1
"Tokyo Narita to Taipei with Scoot. Quick check in. Clean cabin and comfortable seats. On time departure. Premier meal was good. Scoot TV was a hassle to get working. Didn't work on OS9, worked on Samsung tablet. Only 1 free movie per biz seat. Would fly again as was good value.",0
"Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions. A disgrace to Singapore.",1
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The boarding was chaotic but still effective, the only problem is using 1 gate for 3 flights. This flight arrived early and the food is ok. The seat pitch is tight but considering the price paid it is okay. Some of the crew is not so friendly but overall it is quite good.",0
"Worst customer service. I have waited for hours (5) to get through a live person and each time (3 times) the person closed the chat before I could ask a question. Delayed service, faulty planes, cancelled flights, no refund.  They completely and utterly destroyed my holiday. Shameful airline.",1
"I was flying from Dubai to Bangalore and the luggage policy is 30 kgs check-in and 7 kgs hand luggage.  My check-in luggage was 22 kgs and I thought I would move my extra kgs to the check-in, but at the check-in counter, even though I put both pieces of luggage together the guy told me, its ok, you can put it down and didnt ask to measure my hand luggage which is what they normally do. However, after immigration and security, just when I was about to board the flight, they had another scale and were measuring the handbags and wanted me to pay 60 AED (1100 Rs) per kg. They said if I dont pay I cannot get on the flight. They were even charging people for stuff they bought in Duty-free.",1
"Singapore to Perth. We paid an additional $55 each for emergency exits seats. The emergency exit row was divided into 3. 3 seats on the far left, 3 seats in the middle and 3 on the far right. We were situated on the far left. The toilets were located on the far right. The 3 emergency exit seats in the middle row were empty. After take off, I moved to the empty seats in the middle because I was unwell. I did this because I wanted to lie down, I wanted to be in closer proximity to the bathroom and I wanted to distance myself from the other passengers. Two staff initially asked me to move because the seats I was sitting on cost extra. This seemed like an uneconomical use of space considering there was no way for the airline to make money from these seats after the plane had disembarked. I explained that I had paid for an emergency exit seat but had moved to this row because I was unwell. They understood and let me stay. I woke up half way through the flight, moved back to my original seat and tried to eat something. After eating I felt a sharp pain in my abdomen, so I moved back to the same empty row to be closer to the bathroom. This time I sat upright, cross legged on the seat. An air hostess named marched up to me and demanded I move back to my old seat. When I asked her why I couldnt sit in an emergency exit seat closer to the bathroom she simply said it was company policy that these seats remain empty. She couldnt elaborate any further except to say that the pathway to the bathroom was not allowed to be obstructed. I moved back to my assigned seat but expressed that I was sick. Instead of empathising with me, she treated me as though I was being dishonest. She aggressively asked me if I had a fever. I said I did not but I had other unpleasant symptoms. She demanded I list all my symptoms in front of the other passengers. I asked her if it was really necessary to openly list all my symptoms because it was embarrassing for me. This did not appeal to her sensibilities and, once again, she demanded to know what my symptoms were. I listed my symptoms in front of everyone. This was very humiliating for me. She then said I should have told the staff I was sick at the beginning of the flight. I informed her that I had done this. She then told me I could lay down on the vacant seats but not sit up. It made no logical sense. Nate said she would tell the Captain and alert the ground staff. She delivered this as though it was a threat but I agreed this was ok because I had nothing to hide.  When the plane landed a medic was called on board. The medic asked me one question - do I have a fever? I said no and he immediately let me exit the plane. He said that he only needed to be called on board if I had a fever in the last 24 hours. However I had already told staff earlier that I hadnt had a fever, so why did she organise for a medic to board the plane on arrival? I feel as though she deliberately went out of her way to make me feel as uncomfortable as possible.",1
"Phuket to Chiang Mai with AirAsia. Worst service I have ever experienced on an aircraft. I'm 6'4"" tall and literally could not sit in my seat without physically bruising my knees as the legroom is that short. I stood for entire flight apart from when seatbelt signs were on and came away with bad bruising to both my knees. Despite there being 11 extra legroom seats available the cabin crew would not let me sit there (even for extra payment that I offered) but instead just smiled at me as I stood. I showed then the damage the seat had done to my knees after take off and they just did not care. I watched them throw a lady out of the extra legroom seat who was trying to breastfeed a baby, this is how uncaring they are. On making a subsequent complaint I received a totally inadequate reply from them. If you are over 5'8"" do not use. I am now looking at taking legal action for my injuries and suffering as only way I can see these airlines learning.",1
"Pune to Ahmedabad. Although Indigo is good in time management and on time departure, they have deteriorated in terms of customer service.  Although the flight was on time, it took 52 mins to receive the luggage. Also it was surprising that they put the luggage of two adjacently arriving flights on the same belt. This is just not to allow the belt to remain empty. The luggage keeps coming so much less in number and the passengers keep staring at the belt expecting their luggage to come.The attitude of the ground staff is rude.  Also the crew members are not friendly enough.  KPI of ""on time"" is important as a performance indicator but should not be at the cost of passenger satisfaction.",1
"Singapore to Melbourne. The flight left Changi 20 minutes late and arrived 10 minutes early, which is always good. The 787 has a pleasant interior. I was right at the back in 41A. Lots of leg room there. Scoot are a budget airline, so no frills. I ordered the mushroom lasagne and wine, $19 for the combo. The lasagne was hopeless, no discernible cheese, overpowering taste of low quality tomato sauce. I have eaten Asian dish on Scoot before and it was fine, so that'll be my choice in future. Scoot are not special, but from my experience they do their best.",0
"Worst airline I travelled with in in my life. Had a holiday in Queenstown, New Zealand and booked a Scoot flight to Sydney from Singapore, and a Jetstar flight to Queenstown from Sydney. At the start of my trip, I faced no issues entering Sydney with my valid Australian Electronic Travel Authority (ETA), and was promptly cleared by immigration. After which, I took my Jetstar flight to Queenstown, and did not encounter any issue as well. At the end of my Queenstown holiday, I arrived promptly at Queenstown airport to check-in for my Jetstar flight back to Sydney (where I would then take a Scoot flight a couple of hours later from Sydney to my final destination - Singapore). At the Jetstar check-in counter at Queenstown airport, I was asked to present my Australian ETA which I did, and was told by the Jetstar staff that there was an issue with my ETA, because my full name was stated in the Family name field, and told me to apply for a new ETA right then and there. Flabbergasted, (as I had not encountered an issue with my ETA that had allowed me entry into Australia twice before, most recent being the start of my holiday AND my ETA only expired in Mar 2023) I did as I was told and started to apply for a new ETA using the Australian ETA app. As retrieval of passport information via the app is by scanning the chip in the passport, my Full Name auto-populated in the Family name field (and could not be edited). Even on the app, it explicitly said ""For some passport types, the applicants given name will appear in the family name field Please do not rescan the applicants passport in these cases as the information is displaying correctly"". I highlighted this to the Jetstar staff and was then told to NOT use the app to apply for a new ETA, and to do via the website instead, which went contrary to what was written on the website ""From 6 April 2022, all ETA-eligible passport holders can now apply for an ETA using the Australian ETA app At this time, ETA lodgement is only available through the Australian ETA app"". Long story short, as I was not able to reconcile this alleged issue at check-in, the Jetstar staff informed that she would not be able to check me in for my flight, and hence I missed my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, which meant that I also missed my Scoot flight from Sydney back to Singapore. Given that I had to return to Singapore ASAP, I had to spend about SGD$2000 for a one-way last-minute flight ticket back to Singapore from Queenstown, and also spent about SGD$300+ for an unintended additional night's stay in Queenstown given that the next available flight was the next day. Lodged a complaint to Jetstar requesting for an explanation, and was informed that it would take up to 15 days for the Resolutions team to get back to me. 15 days came and gone and I again followed up with Jetstar, who informed that it would take another 5 days to process. 5 days have passed and I have yet to receive any word from Jetstar. Without a response, Jetstar is now impeding my ability to take other necessary actions with other entities that will help me with this monetary loss related to travel disruption. Give this airline a miss. Bad experience and you will end up losing money/ paying for additional costs that would not have arisen had you taken another airline to your destination.",1
"Brisbane to Cairns. 1 out of 10 experience with this airline. We had a first flight from Brisbane to Cairns delayed 7 hours! (We cancelled and booked another one with virgin) then now from Cairns to Sydney which has been delayed for 2,5 hours with initial delay from 9:10 to 10:10 then 11:10 then 11:30. It is 11:30 and we are still sitting here with the boarding sign disappeared. ! Cant you just say a fixed time instead of fooling with us?",1
"An hour flight with AirAsia was pretty worth it. Boarding of the plane was smooth. Stewards were really friendly and the pre-booked meal that I had which was Green Thai Curry was okay. But Nasi Lemak and Chicken Rice is way better. Overall, good experience from a low-cost airlines by AirAsia as usual.",0
"Sunshine Coast to Sydney. The whole trip was a rip off. The staff at the check in counter didnt check the weight of our carry on luggage or notify that our computers are counted within the 7kg carry on weight. At the boarding gate, the staff selectively checked the weight of passengers carry on luggage. And charged extra $60 for an upgrade to 10kg carry on. As a comparison, Virgin Australia checked the same carry on luggage and let us go without extra charge.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. My mum and I were booked on a 3:15 pm flight when we received notification that our flight was cancelled. After contacting Jetstar - the cancellation was apparently due to bad weather. Our travel agent booked us on a 6:15 flight in replacement. Having already booked and paid for transport to the airport for a set time, we went in and decided to just wait the additional time. Not only were there several flights with other airlines (virgin, Qantas & tiger) all leaving at 3pm - going to Sydney (they didnt seem to be affected by this bad weather - the bad weather that was non existent !!) but they were all running on time and had no issues flying out. After checking out bags in - we were informed that the flight, was delayed. After a day full of screw ups from Jetstar, arriving home at 10pm - with work the next day, its safe to say, we are both unimpressed.",1
I flew from Sydney to Hawaii recently and was very impressed especially since my other flights in the following days on Delta and Alaska Airlines were terrible! The staff were very polite and extremely understanding when I told them I had a nut allergy the cabin was clean and the seating was comfortable. The only complaint I could have was the lack of in-flight entertainment you have to pay to get an iPad but other than that it was a wonderful flight. I would definitely recommend Jetstar if you're flying both nationally and internationally.,0
"They text me 3 hours before the departure saying the flight was 5 hours delayed. Then I contacted the support and they told me there was no delay, so I got to the airport and I realize just once I was inside the security gate that the flight is actually delayed and now I have to wait 7 hours without the possibility of walking out and go back home. Terrible service!",1
Tutocurin to Chennai with IndiGo. Very pathetic. Very unprofessional in handling the excess weight. Felt like I was cheated. I have almost traveled with all major airlines but have never had such a bad experience as today with Indigo. I would give minus five stars if I have the option to do so.,1
"Mumbai to Goa by IndiGo. Check-in was quite easy. We were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. Cleanliness had been maintained on this aircraft. The seats were very comfortable and the legroom was fantastic. The overall flight was very enjoyable, and I will have a pleasure flying with IndiGo again.",0
Chennai to Singapore with a stopover in Kuala Lumpur. The journey was great. Even though the flight from Chennai was delayed by half an hour and the seats were not so comfy I liked this airline because of the hospitality and cost. Thank you Airasia for this wonderful journey.,0
We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Vientiane and back and found Air Asia very good both the ground staff and cabin crew were excellent the aircraft was one of the cleanest I have travelled on and the cost and range of drinks and food were also very good. Outbound flight departed on time and on our return we actually departed a little early. Keeping in mind the low price we paid for tickets for a two and half hour flight Air Asia provided excellent value for money and we would certainly use them again.,0
Flew from Sydney-Melbourne-Bangkok and back. The staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. There was no consideration to the urgency to make adjoining flights. Landing back in Melbourne it took them 40 minutes to get our bags onto the turnstile because the 'machine was broken' so thus missed adjoining domestic connection. On top of that- Melbourne custom officers were slow and condescending.,1
It was so surprising and disappointing to see delay of flight 40 mins as one of cabin crew came late and all passengers were waiting inside the aircraft. So irresponsible behaviour by Indigo.,1
"I recently took several flights with IndiGo and didn't experience any major issues. I checked other airlines before I booked and IndiGo were consistently cheaper, often by a wide margin. Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out. But these are minor quibbles, I would have no hesitation choosing IndiGo next time.",0
Flew SIN to PER last week. As it was an evening flight we checked the Jetstar website throughout the day to ensure that our flight was not delayed before heading to the airport. On arrival at 3.30pm we were told the flight had been delayed until 4.00am. The reason was fog over Perth however we watched as other reputable airlines departed as scheduled. We were each given 'meal' vouchers which turned out to be to the value of approx. $7.15 - not enough to purchase a meal from any of the airport vendors. When we approached Jetstar for further compensation they did not provide any. We were forced to spend 12 hours waiting in Changi airport watching time pass. When the flight eventually did depart (after 4am following a long delay on the Tarmac) we were then brought the dinner meals that had been pre-purchased when we believed we would be flying out in the evening! Not being interested in eating dinner at 6.30am this was further money wasted. The small amount of money saved by booking this budget airline was not in the slightest bit worthwhile and I would never fly with Jetstar again.,1
Melbourne to Sydney. I've been flying around the world for years used more than 30 different airlines.  Today when flying Jetstar as a Flexbiz traveller (their highest traveling class for domestic flights) I was choked by the unpleasant behaviour from the check-in staff. When calling for a supervisor she's telling me that she is the one. To the point is that on my booking confirmation it says hand luggage is maximum 14 kg for business travellers. My two bags combine a weight of 14.1 kg. Now the staff tell me maximum for domestic business is 10kg (says nothing about that in the email confirmation). I tell her about the email and she acts cocky (like i'm lying). Now when showing her she claims that that's only valid for international travel. Then I ask how I could possibly know that when it says 14kg on my domestic confirmation. Her answer is that everything is clear. We were already paying for 60kg check-in luggage for two people. They had us reorganize our packing over 4kg claiming it's for security reasons. Then what they are saying is that it's more secure with 14 kg on international flights and that most airlines in the world flying A320s isn't safe enough as they are not applying these ridiculous rules. Now the fact that the so called supervisor refused to give me her full name says a lot.,1
"Flight booked and confirmed on 14.10.2015 for departure on 23/01/2016 at 17:05 Kalibo to Manila on Cebu Pacific. On 18/01/2016 Cebu Pacific announced via email that the flight was canceled due to ""schedule realignment"" proposing another flight at 03:45 of 01/24/2016 and this required my acceptance of the proposed alternative. Contacted customer service but whatever the choice, I was referred back to the manage my booking system where it turns out that, even without accepting the rebooking Cebu Pacific has already confirmed the new flights. Flight on time but a company to avoid.",1
Absolutely disgusted! My wife is flying Jetstar tonight to Cairns on a last minute flight to see her mum who is extremely unwell. She packed in a hurry into carry on baggage. At the flight gate the airline weighed her bags to find that her two bags weighed 9kg not 7kg. As a result they have charged her a total of $90 additional cost in order to enable her to carry the additional 2 kg from Brisbane to Cairns and back. This type of behaviour from an airline to its customers is an absolute disgrace. The airline should honestly be ashamed of itself. I expect that the airline has absolutely no interest in listening to this feedback.,1
"Bought tickets with Turkish (Madrid-Mumbai) with Indigo flying Istanbul -Mumbai - Istanbul. Pretty costly ones due to the urgency to fly. Turkish has very old planes running with neanderthal entertainment systems. From Istanbul the night mare started with Indigo. - On a 7 hour flight just one very small meal and a pretty bad one (uncooked thick parathas, practically they could have given us the wheat flour instead). - No beverage options other than coca cola and water. - Neither coffee or tea was served - No entertainment system - Tried changing return flights but couldn't due to the exorbitant prices asked by Turkish to do so. So suffered the ordeal again while flying back where had fellow passengers complaining regrading the same. The boarding experience was unpleasant as they were really unorganised during the zone call. Being miser or cheap is entirely different from being a low cost Airlines. Indigo should fly cattle instead as Cattle won't complain. Do a favour on mankind by not flying international flights where you bring your corporate cheapness aboard. Rest assured I am never going to fly neither Turkish or Indigo again on an international route.",1
"Puerto Princesa to Manila - I travel frequently through Cebu Pacific. This airlines always boasts about their on time schedules. Unfortunately, most of my flights with CEB are delayed. The airline staff are always announcing that the cause of the delay is the air traffic congestion at the Manila International Airport but for me most of the flights I have been on are the airline's fault. Most of the flights that are delayed are noon to evening flights given that its also peak time for Manila Airport but CEB staff are sometimes not very accommodating and fail to update its passengers about what is happening or what is the cause of the delay. Most of the time, they use gates 131-132 at T3 which means that you have to take a shuttle bus that will lead you to the planes instead of using the air bridge. On this part, CEB is weak but I will still fly CEB because of their new planes and cool games on board.",0
"Really the worst experience of my life. Both of the flights in delay for almost 1 hour, on board no amenities as such water. Everything must be paid. On the second flight (9 hours) not one time the hostess pass with water or something. You must book the food before depart otherwise is never included in the ticket also for the long flights. Seats are poor standard, uncomfortable and no recline. No any entertainment system on board, it looks like came back to 1970s. I will never flight anymore with this company.",1
"I have been using AirAsia since around 2010. I previously had no major problem. However, this time I felt really disappointed with their punctuality. The round trip Jakarta to Singapore, each trip was delayed 45 min to 1 hour. In addition of that, before take off and landing, the crew told the passengers that due to traffic on the airport, the aircraft had to wait for another 15 to 30 min. For me, that just could not be more annoying. AirAsia is no longer a budget flight. The price has gone up tremendously. It is often more expensive than Batik Air, the premium brand of the Lion Air group. Unlike Lion, I hardly heard anyone complaining about Batik problems such as delays. With competitors now offering better options and coming up with new promotions, I think AirAsia may start losing its grip. Check-in now has to be self-service and the early passengers can't choose their seats. It is now randomly assigned. Distance between rows is really narrow.",1
Kept waiting for more then one hour in the plane to pick up some late comers. I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality. Never again.,1
Flew 4 times back in May 2013 as they are no doubt the major low-cost airline in Asia. One is DMK-PHN and another one is DMK-HKT. Both are returned flight. Good move by Thai AirAsia for choosing DMK as their hub - less hassle and easy to get to. Check-in was easy and it is how you talk with the check-in staff in order to get seat you want/close to your partner/friend. I flew with my fianc so we did manage to get the seat we want by just talking your way through. Aircraft is a new A319 which was a complete step-up from their old B737 a couple years ago I flew with them. Nothing fancy about cabin crew as we did not use their service at all (not buying any food). I would definitely fly them again - just because of their competitive price compared to other airline such as Bangkok Airways and Thai Airways.,0
"Jetstar Airways flight from Melbourne - Narita delayed 3 hours. Flight was non-stop on an ok plane with proper facilities/seats/etc. Narita - Melbourne was a real pain. Our return was via Cairns. Queue at Narita horrendous. Few counters. 2 flights all queued up waiting. No bag drop. 1 hour or more to check-in here. Our flight had been changed from via Cairns to via Gold coast with no notification so all seats I had booked were lost and our family was unable to sit together. I didnt know this at time but the stopover in Gold Coast required us to clear customs, collect luggage, check-in again at Domestic terminal. Ended up in a very basic Airbus at the end of a long trip. Deposited at terminal 4 Melbourne which is close to 1km to walk to transport/parking buses. We were on a ski trip so had large luggage, having to collect and it and check it in 4 times plus haul it to main airport. Have never had to transfer my own luggage before on an international flight when i booked all the way through. I would not recommend this trip to anyone.",1
"This flight had no meal supplies and I had a meal booked with my ticket.  I was offered cashews & almonds in place of a meal at 8 PM. The Air Hostess told me ""There are more options available but today we don't have any."" This happened when I was sitting in 6th row, I can only imagine what people in 16th or 60th row had.  Why would you charge money for a meal & not provide it?",1
"Bagdogra to Delhi. Check-in slightly chaotic at IXB. Flight full to the last seat. Service on board consisted of one cup of water. Seats narrow with not much legroom, which guaranteed very close contact to the neighbors. Arrival in DEL on time but we had to wait for some 40 min for the checked baggage to appear. We had flown the same route with Jet Airways before, who provided a much better experience than IndiGo.",1
Kolkata-Chennai-Pune leg. The airline offers a very good product with excellent staff to go with it. The aircraft is well-maintained and the staff know what they are offering. They are a low-cost carrier however they don't cut corners on security and service.,0
I have flown Scoot with the whole family twice in the past 3 months from Sydney to Singapore and then the reverse. The ground service is poor. Long queues excessively long times to check-in (stood at check-in for 45 mins). On one occasion we arranged for Scoot to have someone assist my non-English speaking cousin to take her through customs and on to the plane. When we got to the airport our assistance had not been assigned. We waited until the queues had vanished from check-in and the counter staff simply ignored us and went on with their other duties. t is impossible to get through to their call centre - they seem to be perpetually experiencing a high volume of calls never mind the time. I've tried calling at around 9pm Sydney time 6am Sydney time and about 2pm Singapore time. Only got through once at the 6am timeslot and only after been put on hold for 45 mins (time by Skype).,1
"Flew Jetstar Airways from Phnom Penh to Singapore. Does not allow carry on the same size as every other airline, doesn't inform you when you book the ticket, then charges a 'fee' almost as much as the original ticket price to bring carry on luggage. I realize this is how budget airlines make their money, but their carry on policies should remain in line with industry standards or be presented honestly. Don't fly this airline.",1
KUL-SIN-KUL. Return flight to Singapore for a day trip. $40 return so cant complain about the price. No issues with check in on both legs. Fairly new A320s which for some reason had very old worn seats (maybe moved from their older retired aircraft). That is probably the only minor complaint. Cabin crew friendly and efficient managed to serve meals and drinks and clean up on a very short 45 min flight. Both flights landed on time. Over all a good experience would fly with them again.,0
"Scoot has made an excellent choice with this aircraft. This was my first time flying on a Neo, and it was an experience that was well worth having. Aircraft was basically brand new. Extremely clean, and best of all, quiet. The lack of engine noise is a godsend, and certainly makes the flight much more bearable in so many ways. Cabin crew were happy, and up to their usual professional standards. I've been a private pilot for many years, but I was still awestruck by the acceleration on this aircraft as we left Cebu-Mactan. Interior colors were well chosen, WiFi was available on the aircraft but I did not use it. A little turbulence on-route, but of course this is unavoidable. Flight crew kept us updated about the progress of the flight. Arrived in Changi right on time, and de-boarded with no issue at all. Scoot was also good enough to allow me to bring my flight forward from March 27th to March 13th at no additional cost. This was greatly appreciated. This is the exact opposite of my previous review, when I had my first flight cancelled by the airline. Well done Scoot.",0
Flew CGK to PAD on 29 January 2013. Terminal 1 departure. Terminal is old and has little to offer. Hot and humid only departure area is AC but has far too few seats and was cramped noisy and chaotic. Flight was delayed for almost 2 hours and no announcements were made. Flight even disappeared from the information board. Airline officials offered very little assistance and only told us to wait. Finally a stampede of rushing people as sign of boarding and also this time no announcement. No English information provided. Plane was new 737-800. Seats cramped but felt new. In my few very poor service. Its cheap but it comes with a lot of suffering.,1
Queenstown to Auckland. Worst airline. They refused to let us check in early with our 11 month old baby and could not let us check in online as it would not work and have booked us in separate seats. And my fianc had shoulder surgery so cant do anything with his arm and they sat our child with him and wont change it so he can sit with me. We went to the desk to try to change it and they just told us we have to leave it the way it is and wont do anything,1
"Jakarta to Denpasar. First time to Bali and bought these tickets on this airline based on price, did not really do any research before hand. The service on this airline was fine, I really had no complaints, the flight left on time, the seats were fine for the short flight that it was and the employees at check in and in the airplane were very nice. My only complaint is that due to my age and bad legs, boarding was done having to go down steps from the terminal to the tarmac and then up the stairs to the airplane. Similar situation upon arriving in Denpasar. Not the end of the world, just that those behind me had to suffer with my lack of speed down and up the stairs.",0
"Adelaide to Sydney. Absolutely awful service. We had booked two flights, one to Sydney and the other back to Adelaide. Both services being cancelled! Not only were they both cancelled but they didnt attempt to get us on any other flights to our destination and they only told us that our flight was cancelled an hour before we intended to leave for our flight BOTH TIMES ! Most unreliable airline company there is, I would definitely not recommend.",1
"Manila to Singapore. Don't fly Singapore if the connector airline is Scoot! As a frequent flyer to Asia, I have flown Singapore Airlines ever since 1994, and have been delighted.  Scoot agents (not wearing any name tags) and its call center are unprofessional, heartless, untrustworthy, lacking of common sense or courtesy, and a disgrace to the once proud Singapore brand. My wife was at Clark Airport near Angeles City in the Philippines, trying to take a short flight to Singapore so that she could connect with the flight back home to San Francisco. Scoot personnel would not let her board her flight, without paying 90 dollars for a ""mysterious"" and spurious cancellation fee. She never cancelled. The agent had issued the tickets, there wasn't any rescheduling, but, they insisted. This was a scam to get her to pay them 90 more than likely. She did not have the money, she had spent all of her money on family in the Philippines.  Why would she show up at airport if she cancelled? You can't just cancel a roundtrip, you must reschedule, or there would be flags and notifications everywhere. The flight from Singapore was still valid, and they didn't know of any cancellation. Spent two hours on a conference call with our ticketing agent and Scoot call-center. They kept saying there was a charge, but for what, there never was a cancellation. Even the manager couldn't do anything. He said that I had to write an email to the sales department, can't call, and await response!",1
"As an elite gold flyer I am promised priority check in and best seats available, I got neither. Now I am on Scoot to Bangkok from Singapore. Same issues though this time on cheaper ticket though still entitled to elite gold privileges. First world problem but if they dont honor their promises whats the point.",1
"JQ828/JQ907, Brisbane to Townsville return. Reading the reviews here, I was worried about Jetstar cancelling flights etc, but the fares were so good, I decided to take the risk. Both flights departed late, no explanation offered, but made up the time during the flights. Otherwise, everything went well. Very new planes. Seats were okay. FAs very impersonal, but got their job done. Overall, good flights. For the ticket prices, I was satisfied.",0
MNL-USU-MNL. Our flight to USU was an hour late. Boarding was unbelievably disorganized. At one point staff just left and let everybody sort of do their own thing. On our way back to Manila our flight was 3 hrs delayed with no particular reason. Id rather pay extra in exchange for better service.,1
Makassar to Denpasar. Unreliable. Massively delayed flight caused us to miss our connecting flights. Each prior flight on our trip with Lion also suffered delays of some sort. Lack of clear information provided at the departure gates. Information provided verbally conflicted with electronic boards at the departure gates. Not recommended.,1
Flew with Scoot several times and no complaints so far. Traveled from Singapore to Sydney for about S$200+ return trip (FlyBag) from a sale. We have sat on both standard (Blue) and Super (Yellow) seats and both were comfortable and have very spacious legroom (I could cross my legs with a standard seat). Cabin crew were very friendly and always served us quickly with a smile on their faces. We ordered a Beef Bourguignon Pasta Stew and some snacks on board and despite the small portion the meal was delicious. Other then that the flights were always on time and would definitely fly with Scoot again.,0
Terrible airline! Will never fly with them again & would not recommend. Had 2 flights and both were delayed. Caused me to miss a connecting flight. Airline refused to accept responsibility or assist causing me to have to pay for a whole new ticket. Second flight was delayed over an hour. No announcement regarding the delay. All in flight food & beverages are for charge. Very poor customer service and response when talking to people directly and when using the chat feature.,1
"On our way to Bangkok airport we received a voucher for the cancelled flight home!  A new internet booking for 9.000 baht isnt possible, instead we have to buy an overpriced ticket for 21.000 baht. After buying the ticket they didnt want to let us fly! We showed an email from the Greek ministery of foreign affairs giving green light for my wife - and they checked us through to Athens. In Singapore Scoot denied boarding to my Korean wife (not me). we tried to show the mfa email, they didnt want to see it. The boarding staff sent us to Transfer D: theres a Scoot office taking care of everything and they will help us. But in transfer D theres just a night staff, who cant do anything for us and many other Scoot nightmare guests.  No service, no food, no water, no help at all. Our luggage is not available - its behind immigration . If we go out, well be quarantined for 14 days. The Scoot manager is kidding us: We need a medical certificate, we would get it in a clinic nearby. But this clinic doesnt test anyone - and the manager should know it.  No flight money back! The manager was generous enough to give us the flight to Bangkok instead of Athens. Since march 20 Scoot didnt refund anything, doesnt answer emails.",1
"Filthy airplane, delays, and no whatsoever interaction with the crew besides welcome and goodbye. Horrible check-in (disorganised), after boarding a delay without any explanation, with people sporadically walking in (even after take off time was well beyond), no one to be seen during the 1,5 hr flight (not to buy some water, not to mention proactively offering something). To top it the disgraceful luggage collection at Soekarno Hatta Airport, which takes ages and truly is something they should be ashamed of.",1
Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. I have to say this was the worst travel experience I have had. We bought our fares through an online booking service rather than the airline. On the way there it was bought as one package i.e. one flight to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur then connecting flight to Ho Chi Minh City and we also bought a package of 2 flights for the way back the exact same way online. When arriving at Sydney no problem for the airline staff to print us both boarding passes for the Kuala Lumpur flight and also the Ho Chi Minh City flight at the same time. On the way back different story. They said that these were two separate flight bookings that our online booking service had made for us. So in KL we then had to go through all their security and customs and then check our bags again and this took us about 1.5 hours. Many times I have brought my own decaf coffee with me on the plane as airlines never serve decaf coffee and I don't drink caffeine. I usually just ask them if I can have a cup of boiling water with some milk and I add my own decaf coffee.  I got told by a very nice air hostess that she would give me the hot water and milk (powdered) for free and that if I asked on another flight for this that I might be told to pay for a drink. There is no in flight entertainment and meals are not free as a low-cost airline. When you  pay for a meal on the plane you must pay in Malaysian currency or credit card. Then if you don't have credit card you can't purchase anything. Fortunately I had some US dollars in cash and they made a quick conversion and I paid in that for my items.,1
"Very below par airline! They cancelled my flight that was booked from Cairns to Melbourne on Sept 27th 2018. Wouldn't refund me and wouldn't change my flights without having to pay ""the change flight fee"" As I am a mad Westcoast Eagles supporter who had tickets to the AFL grand final that weekend and to the footy show for that night. The flight was cancelled in that morning, there was no way I was going to miss out. I was then forced to book a new flight that day with Tiger airways. At a cost of $400!! I tried everything and was on the phone for an extensive amount of time. All I asked was for at least a refund as I had to rebook another flight. Will never fly with Jetstar again! Very disappointing from a very below par airline.",1
"Kalibo to Hong Kong via Manila with Cenu Pacific. Delayed 5 hours on a flight with an average running time of 45 minutes. I've been on the road because of their incompetence for 13 hours from Borocay to Hong Kong. Everything else on the journey was incredibly unqualified, from airport facilities to air service to crisis management and just the ground crew kindness was outstanding. The plane itself was miserable, tattered and taped panels and leaking air con vents right over me and in other places too. Even luggage delivery in Hong Kong was delayed and that has never happened to me before in such an efficient airport. The delay is fully on charge of management incompetence since there was no environmental situation forcing such delay but just unavailable parking in Manila, according to crew explanation. This definitely was overall the worst trip I ever had in my 20 years traveling.",1
Brisbane to Sydney. I am very happy with the treatment from Jetstar. We had a 2 hour delay at the airport. The ground staff were very patient and kind to the disheveled passengers they encountered. They gave myself and 2 daughter's $200.00 travel vouchers each and a food vouchers. Luckily the delay wasn't such an inconvenience to us but I know other people on that flight had time schedules. I was more than pleased and give Jetstar a good rap all the time.,0
"Booked Jetstar business class flight to Tokyo Narita. Noticed first leg was normal economy to Gold Coast airport. carry on luggage only 7 kgs. Rest of flight 14 kgs. No use to us, restricted to 7 kg carry on for entire flight to Japan. Asked if we were permitted 14 kg as we were flying business class the rest of the way, not permitted. Then we found that we were not permitted to enter any lounge, business class or other. We had nearly 4 hour wait in Gold Coast airport before take off. We were not permitted into Qantas lounge despite it being empty. 4 hours between flights going over; 5 hours delay coming back. A substantial part of the reason flying business class is access to a lounge for business and other purposes particularly if you are in your seventies. Our business class seat was jammed and would not recline, quality of food very poor.",1
Now sat in Manila awaiting a flight to Singapore. Of course it has just been announced that it will be delayed plus the previous flight and just about every outbound flight tonight. Weather is fine and skies clear? My connecting flight from Dumagute was also delayed tonight and a flight home from Bangkok last Tuesday delayed. No way to complain to Cebu Pacific or would they care less.,1
I took the Scott fight from Kaohsiung to Singapore on 15 Oct 2015. This was my second time flying with Scoot. The first time was earlier this year on the SIN-TPE-SIN route. The plane departed on schedule and arrived about 3/4 hour ahead of schedule. Both the ground and air crew were generally polite and friendly. Definitely a more positive experience compared to my previous experience flying with Scoot.,0
This is a bad bus service. On my travel BKK-CCU the check-in lines were ridiculous with attendants weighing every piece of baggage. Not sure if the web check-in works as I still had to stand in a long line for over 75 minutes to hand in baggage. The flight itself was fine seats seemed like they were for kids. Attendants seem inexperienced and lack manners.,1
"Flew Jetstar Airways three times in the past six months. 1st failure on way to airport for flight to Cairns received sms to advise flight was cancelled with no way of re-booking flight and cursory response from counter person first available 10 hours later. 2nd failure flew out from Melbourne on December 2nd over two hours late. 3rd failure flew in from Gold Coast, December 8th over two hours late. Sorry Jetstar three strikes and you're out.",1
Sydney to Melbourne. I just got charged $65 for being over on carry on luggage even though I have zero checked-in luggage. The ground staff were nabbing hapless passengers pre flight like revenue-desperate parking cops. Very uncool. Not travelling with them again!,1
AKL-SIN-KUL return. Flight itself was good. Seat was comfortable though the leg rest on the seat of the return flight was not as adjustable as the outward flight. Meals were ok as airline food goes. Glad we paid the extra to fly business. Only snag we had was the booking we made. Our return flight from K Lumpur to Singapore and onto Auckland we were told that we had to go through immigration collect our bags go through customs then check in again and go through immigration again to board our flight from Singapore to Auckland! Though we were travelling with Jetstar right through they couldn't check our bags through to Auckland. Reason given was the booking numbers. Wished that we were told when we booked with Jetstar. Luckily it happened in Changi Airport as they are super efficient that we managed to do that with little stress.,0
"The experience my partner had on Friday night with Jetstar was appalling! Im working in Melbourne so my partner and my 15 month old daughter travelled from Sydney to Melbourne to meet me for the weekend. When he went to check in the gentleman that served him advised him that our Nano travel pram was ok to take on the flight. When he went to the gate to board, the 3pm flight was delayed to 3.45pm, then 4.20pm and again to 4.45pm. When he finally went to board after 5.45pm- yes another delay! The staff were rude, unhelpful and wouldnt let him board with the travel pram because it wasnt in a bag! Mind you our daughters sleeping had been planned around the 3pm departure so she was well and truly fed up by this stage and crying in my partners arms while they adamantly would not let him on without the pram in a bag. They had absolutely no empathy that he was a father traveling alone with a baby, and when he asked what options he had they simply gave him nothing! The rule was the rule! He already had worries about traveling alone with her and your staff did everything in their sad power to worsen the concerns! He was willing to dump the $400 pram to get on the flight but even still they had an issue with that! Its absolutely disgusting and appalling service! Thank fully he walked away from the gate, called me for advice and we had another option through Sydney airport staff! He ended up getting the flight to Melbourne and my 15 month old daughter was exhausted. They arrived after 8pm vs the originally proposed 4.30pm! My partner flew home with virgin and had a brilliant pain free experience, Jetstar- you really need to change the approach your staff have in situations where they should show empathy and compassion especially when you expect your flyers to be ok with a longer than 3 hour delay! Its disgusting and I will always choose any other airline rather than Jetstar.",1
"Phuket to Sydney. No food or beverages provided without extra cost. No inflight entertainment without extra cost. I wasn't prepared to pay $8 to watch a 20 year old film. Couldn't even access the games without paying. 8 hour overnight flight with no meals provided, just water.",1
"The Cebu Pacific website disconnects, times out, and stops loading a lot. I think they just didn't set it up to handle online traffic very well. It disrupted my booking constantly and worse, didn't process my payment properly so the booking was not confirmed, yet I was charged on my credit card. Their customer service is a Facebook chat and the staff are unfortunately not even trusted by their company with anything to do with my account so not very much help at all when I had to open a dispute on the charge since they never fixed that charge (to this day, months later and I had to book a second time, still unresolved and waiting for dispute case). The customer service help desk shouldn't be a Facebook chat - should be an actual phone line and their staff should be trained on account matters. Also their website currently is confusing with an ""old"" and ""new"" version for when you want to manage your booking. Certain options can only be done on either versions. The mobile app doesn't work at all. Always has an error. On the actual flight: the NRT>MNL plane does not have reclining seats and they do offer meals but you have to buy them. So if you are going to be hungry, eat before your board. While they were serving the snacks, I normally am okay and indifferent to the smell of instant noodles but somehow on that flight, it was just overpowering since we're in an enclosed space. After some time and just before our stomachs were going to turn inside out, thankfully the staff sprayed something in the air that eliminated the odor but I think serving such a strong smelling food is not good for flights in my opinion. The only thing I think that I can say is positive is that their check-in staff and cabin attendants were professional the entire time. I get they are a budget airline and for prices to be cheap, you compromise a lot on things but I think Cebu Pacific doesn't even meet the basic standards that other budget airlines do. So be wary of booking with them. If your budget allows for a bit more, try another airline for your route.",1
"My Travel Itinerary: 2 Adults and 2 Kids, Per Pax 23 Kgs*2 Baggage + 7 Kgs Cabin Luggage allowed. & Oct 28 IAD to DOH to HYD (Qatar & Indigo) &; Dec 26 HYD to DOH to IAD (Indigo & Qatar) The journey from IAD to DOH is pretty and happier with their Code Share partner; all the staff at Origin are helpful, courteous, and professional. Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first. For ""Indigo"" Airlines, this is not the case will ""dump"" people onto the Bus and transport them from Gate to the Aircraft. In-Flight: Seating is congested, just like Auto-Rickshaw. The cabin crew is courteous and helpful. Landing: 30 Minutes late from their scheduled arrival. As a result, we had to spend another 30 Minutes at the HYD Airport for Immigration Officers' shift rotation. Overall DOH-HYD Experience is just a dump yard ride for me in Indigo Airlines. The journey from HYD to DOH, concerns starts with Check-In until the Landing. Nonetheless, this part of the journey is the most ""Interesting"" part of this review, don't miss it. Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code. Reached the Airport 4 hours before departure, Kids in arms and eight bags to check-in (opted porter service), had to stay in line for 1 hour 25 minutes to approach the check-in counter after repeated requests to follow the check-in code. Finally, at the check-in counter, the indigo staff was inclined to charge me 15k INR extra as my three bags had 1 kg extra and other bags had less than 23 kg allowed. Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight. We (my family) took a personal oath not to fly ""Indigo"" in our life in their ""International"" sector to avoid amateurish personnel and never on time. We booked a hotel at IAD Airport to wait for the baggage to arrive and travel back home.",1
"On checking in for my Jetstar Airways flight at Cairns, the check-in terminal wouldn't accept my booking reference and said to go to the service counter. When I got there the lady behind the desk took ages to serve me. When I said that I needed to check in she said that I had to use the kiosk. I explained that it wasn't working and she said that I would have to line up in the regular check in lane with everyone else. I told her I had no hold luggage and she then insisted on looking at my carry on bag and weighing it. It was 300g over the 7kg limit and said I'd have to pay and check it in. Throughout she was rude and surly. When she dealt with my friend (a non-native English speaker) she treated him as a second class citizen. This was the first time in about 3 years that I used Jetstar because I'd had such a horrid experience with them flying from Gold Coast airport to Sydney and swore to myself never to use them again.",1
"The worst ground service by the staff in Trichy airport. I had only hand luggage with my laptop and chargers in my laptop bag which total was 9.1 kg, I was asked to pay for 2.1 kg of a total sum of Rs.6772/- i was made to wait and i was the last passenger to get my boarding pass for my flight. Since when was the laptop started to get in to total weight of the luggage. (if so why didn't they ask to weigh my 2 phones which i was carrying in my pocket, which would add another 1/2 kg for them to charge me ).",1
Another round trip from CNX to KUL. Once you know how to 'play' low cost airlines they do offer good value for money (but not always). The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry. FA's need to be more strict (politely of course) with pax who get ready to get off long before the aircraft reaches the gate.,0
"I chose Air Aisa because I was travelling with a child and no other directs flight to KL was available. First of all they force people to use PSA which sells expensive tickets by making a bank error on online service if using cards from Maldives. They lost my luggage cover, which was never found after struggles.  On my second sector to Kota Bharu- the que was long and when I reached to drop off the baggage (like a minute) they said I was too late and send me from one counter to another and made me wait and said I can board the plane without the luggage (while travelling with a 2 year old). No other options. Had to buy buy 2 extra tickets for me and the child. 3. When I left the trolley at a side, Air Asia staff told me to take it to the another location, I said I cannot leave my baby behind to put the trolley back, he mumbled rudely.",1
"Tagbilaran to Manila. AirAsia is extremely gimmicky and unprofessional! I've flown with very many different airlines for almost 40 years now and I've never ever experienced such unprofessional treatment. They are the only airline that counts your personal/cosmetic bag as part of carry-on baggage weight. However, they only selectively enforce this policy so that makes them utterly unprofessional. I chose to fly with AirAsia for the first time because they had the cheapest cost for my round trip from Manila to Tagbilaran/Panglao, Bohol in the Philippines. On the Manila, to Tagbilaran flight, my carry-on baggage and personal/cosmetic bag were not even checked or weighed at all, but on my flight back the customer service agent chose to enforce their stupid policy and made me pay an extra baggage fee. The worst part about this experience was that I was made to open and repackage my personal/cosmetic bag, carry-on bag, and checked baggage while I was at the check in counter. I was struggling to get the weight just right for them and a security guard noticed me struggling and whispered to me to just take out my laptop from my carry-on baggage because then AirAsia won't count it as carry-on weight if I only take out my laptop and carry it by hand. It's so damn ridiculous! Why didn't the customer service agent just tell me this and save me money, time, embarrassment, and frustration in the first place? Why did she make me go through all that trouble and money and time wasted? I also asked this customer service agent to let me speak with the manager and she just kept telling me ""ok"" or ""they're busy right now."" I also noticed that very few other passengers were made to weigh both their carry-on and personal/cosmetic bags as I were. This horrible airline is the worst airline I've ever flown on in my almost 40 years of flying all over the world on so many other different airlines and I will never ever fly with this joke of an ""airline"" ever again. If you want professional and fair service do not ever fly with Air Asia! They're just a gimmick and a huge joke!",1
"AirAsia has no proper customer support and not able to reach customer care. They have bot AVA with limited options that can't resolve your issues. Due to cheap quality website, I got duplicate ticket for same flight on same date. I raised a ticket and try to follow up with airasia.com in many ways but no luck.",1
"AirAsia flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore left a little bit late at KLIA2 due to congestion at the airport. Check in area was bit chaotic but the check in lady was very polite and professional. Plane was relatively modern looking and clean. The crew seemed friendly. For an one hour flight, there was nothing to complain about.",0
I flew from Pune to Bangalore on 30th December 2013 on Flt 6E 407. I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo. This is the first time I've been on the receiving end of aloof treatment from Indigo staff.,1
"I booked a flight with them to New Zealand in June, which was cancelled due to coronavirus. Instead of giving me a refund, Jetstar just gave me a voucher. Today is 4th August, my Australian visa is expiring soon and I must go back to my home country (where Jetstar do not operate). Due to this situation I will not be able to use this voucher because traveling is not allowed at this times and I do not have any plans to go back to Australia at any time soon. When I've called Jetstar today to explain this situation and require a refund of my money the answer I have received was: ""you can sell you voucher to someone else if you can not use it"". Now, I will lose $700 because Jetstar do not care about their customers and have a completely disrespectful policy. Believe me, this company just care about money and if they can take advantage of you they will. Do not lose your time and money with this people.",1
Went from Delhi to Kochi because there is no such thing as a direct Delhi to Male (Maldives) flight and even with connections you have to mix and match airlines in order to get a halfway decent connection schedule. The airline is like the low budget carriers in Europe with people packed in like sardines. They don't have an inflight magazine that actually has anything to read or even a map with their air routes.,1
"Perth to Singapore. Extremely bad service regarding infants onboard, even for a low budget airline. Not only was there no priority boarding which is common for most airlines in the world but we werent even allowed to stand by boarding desk. Had to take all our things and stand by another gate!",1
"They cancelled on me providing no reason or compensation, which is expected behavior for a Lion Air. So I rescheduled, and of course that other flight also got cancelled. So if your time is precious avoid this airline. If you are looking to gamble on whether or not you will actually fly, take Lion Air.",1
"Scoot is the worst airline ever. It rivals Frontier and Spirit in the US. It even looks like Spirit as both airlines are that ugly banana yellow color. First, their website showed the flight as sold out, but I was able to book online, but they charge you an extra fee to book online. Yes, this company charges extra just to sell you a ticket. Then the flight was very late. We didn't board until after the official cut off time for boarding had actually passed. Once onboard, the flight attendants were rude and curt. Then, they couldn't get the plane off the ground, so on top of being 30 minutes late, they couldn't take off for nearly another hour. So the plane finally took off well over an hour late. Most ridiculous, was that the seat next to me was empty, and I set my jacket on that seat. The flight attendant made me remove my jacket from the seat for takeoff, and also remove my headphones. No US carrier makes you remove your headphones for takeoff. Is this an Asian thing, or are they that challenged that they think that is an effective safety measure. Lastly, this seat is so uncomfortable, it is curved so much my spine feels like it is doing the Cow yoga pose. This is a terrible airline and I would never fly it again. I feel like I did the one time I flew Spirit in the US. I feel dirty, abused, and like a worse human being because of the experience.",1
"Flew Scoot and purchased the FlyBagEat. Comfort wise was actually good even for economy. Food for Melbourne to Singapore leg was passable although the servings was small compared to normal economy food, not enough to last the 7 hours flight. Very bad food for the return leg Singapore to Melbourne. Breakfast was scrambled eggs set or croissants with ham and cheese. The eggs was a huge disappointment and the hash brown was mushy. The croisant was cold. Scoot should be penalised for serving this kind of food. Asked about the scrambled eggs, a staff responded there had been complaints. Will still fly Scoot and bring my own food.",0
Biz class from Bangkok to the Gold Coast (returning in economy). I could have bought a cheaper ticket on Singapore Airlines or Thai Airlines in economy and got better service if I compare the so-called biz amenities to the economy features of other airlines. Scoot Biz priority boarding poor - only a few moments after calling for the biz section they called everyone else and without a separate line we had to stand in line with everyone else. No hot towel or wipe onboard. One meal only consisting of a small dish that would not feed an adult and a Toblerone. One drink of water in the entire flight one other drink with my meal. InFlight Entertainment nil unless one happens to have an iPad). No blanket or pillow. Scoot has managed to cut costs so much that they are falsely advertising the biz class as something worth paying extra for but in fact it is even below economy in normal airlines. I was particularly appalled that they do not provide water on demand especially on the longer flights. When we arrived at Coolangata the final straw was the use of a single set of stairs that accessed the economy cabin so that the Scootbiz passengers that had paid a premium were among the last to leave the aircraft.,1
"I recommend ZIPAIR. My friend and I booked a flight on Zipair because it was cheap. Once we booked we noticed the website was hard to navigate, the app we were supposed to download preflight isn't available in the US yet and there weren't many reviews. We Googled Zipair to make sure it was a real airline. The moment we checked in we realized this airline is real and it's an amazing deal. The customer service reps at check in asked if we'd been to Japan before and what we were excited about doing while quickly and efficiently checking us in. It was a great start but were concerned about seat comfort and inflight Wifi. As we entered the plane we realized seat comfort was not an issue. The seats were a clean, comfortable leather and had more leg space than most American carriers. Once we got in the air the Wifi connected quickly so we could access email and order food. It's not strong enough to download movies or tv shows so do that before you board. Food options are limited, they run out quick if you don't preorder. I suggest eat early or bring your own food. Beverages were comparably priced with other airlines and it didn't seem to run out of any drinks. The inflight staff was very attentive and kept trash out of the aisles and seat backs the entire flight. Our return trip from Tokyo to San Francisco was exactly the same. Friendly staff during check in, comfortable seats, quick WiFi for ordering food and checking email and very attentive flight attendants. My friend and I agreed we'd definitely recommend ZipAir to others and would fly them again.",0
"I've flown Scoot several times and they've been okay but on this flight, I noticed something was wrong with my seat as we were taking off. When we were airborne, I got up to check it out. The seat was broken, the seat cushion not attached to anything and moving freely. I called the cabin attendant and she said she'd talk to her supervisor. She came back with one of their packaged blankets (more like a thin polyester sheet) and said I could use it as a cushion! Because the plane was full, they couldn't reseat me (there were seats in the Scoot Plus section) and the crew insisted that I sit on the broken seat for the entire flight. They had no interest in resolving the problem, just kept asking me what they should do! The cabin attendant ended up forcing a man to swap seats with me. Not really a good solution! Other than that, the flight was on time and no other problems.",1
Flew SIN to SYD. The only issue is with the timing of departure being so early in the morning but I compensated with the use of the transit lounge. Early Check-in was a positive. Overall the flight was fine for the price paid meal was adequate and seat recline good for a sleep. For price definitely worth it if you don't mind sacrifices.,0
"Manila to Melbourne via Singapore. Thought I would give scoot a try, and certainly glad that i did.  The planes were clean and roomy. The check in process was flawless, the website was simple to navigate. The flight crew were exceptional. Friendly and happy faces. I need to say that the uniforms were brilliants. Well done to everyone at Scoot airlines.",0
DEL-BLR-DEL. Both legs had a before time push back reached destination 10-15 mins early. Quick professional check-in. Had pre-ordered meals good value for money. Only problem with this airline is that you cannot just pre- book seats meals have to be booked with it otherwise highly recommended.,0
"I flew on the 787 from SYD-HNL-SYD. The flight out of Sydney was about 2 hours late due to arriving late into Sydney. We purchased tickets during the Jetstar sale and once adding all the bells and whistles on top the ticket was still very reasonably priced. A tip is if you prebook seating to book in the front section of the economy cabin (mini cabin) because there's only 4 rows of economy here. Front row next to the window because no one reclines into you. The seats are fairly narrow at 9 abreast. Food was edible both ways, drinks were fine and if you wanted more you could purchase it. Excess luggage was reasonable and fortunately available to purchase. Inflight entertainment had plenty of options to keep someone entertained during the flight as well. Plus a usb port to charge devices as well which was ideal for phone/tablet. Crew were visible but didn't go to any extreme lengths to do anything above and beyond their limits.",0
"Flew AirAsia from Denpasar to Perth. Had booked Red Carpet to eliminate queues through security immigration and passport control, and it did work very well, including access to a very good lounge. The whole thing was ruined by imposition of a fingertip search of cabin baggage - 30 minutes in the queue. AirAsia - we approve the need for security measures, but you must provide those who have paid for red carpet to receive the benefits they paid for.",1
"Adelaide to Cairns with Jetstar. Had the exit row both ways which made the difference on a 3 hour flight. Found the staff quite pleasant to Cairns and on the return. Paid $40.00 extra for checked bags, seat selection, $10.00 food voucher (chose tea and muffin), and Qantus points, again worth it I think. Overall a good flight and good value. Should note though that leg room in standard seating isn't great.",0
BKK-SIN. Service staff very slow in handling check in. No premium lane for immigration and no lounge for biz class. My luggage tag was lost by scoot and needed replacement. Onboard head crew asked what meal I would like told her I had pre-ordered my meals but that menu had changed. However I had paid for the premium meal. I requested for the code for inflight entertainment I tried to press the call button but no crew responded the lights were on for an hour. The food was similar to economy class. Seat was slightly bigger. My luggage came out last as there is no priority for biz class passenger.,1
5J 805 MNL-SIN. First time to taking Cebu Pacific internationally and I was honestly a little apprehensive. PROS: Cheaper fare than PR or SQ. Online check in (not available in PR) allows me more time to do more things before heading to the airport. Use of T3 instead of surly T1 or stuffy T2. CONS: Tight seats and poor pitch (you get what you pay for). Poor selection of in flight meals for purchase. This is most pronounced in flights scheduled during the lunch or dinner hours. Will consider flying with them but will always give it second and third thoughts.,1
"I took this flight from Makassar Sultan Hasanuddin Airportback to Kuala Lumpur. It was a late morning flight and it departed on time. The flight was nearly full but everything went smoothly, thanks mostly to the cabin crew expertly managing the passengers. I bought a prepaid gift online that was delivered during flight, as promised. The flight was more or less smooth along the way.",0
"To this day they have not been able to send me my itinerary. It's been almost a month. It has not only complicated my trip because they couldn't find me in the system, but also my vacation because I couldn't apply for my visa in time (I need to prove my return ticket). I tried in vain to find some contact, it always redirected me to some online chat which absolutely does not work. I couldn't find any email. Terrible! Food on the plane disgusting and expensive. I am disgusted!",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Nha Trang with AirAsia. Simply the worst airline in the world, many years running. Ive been unfortunate enough to have to rely on this sorry excuse for an airline for years and not once, not once, have I ever had a good experience. Not a single flight that went smoothly, with no delay or some other nonsense. Awful service, always late, anything to take your money and always unpleasant. The only thing they havent charged us for yet is oxygen on board, which at some point it will probably be charged also, 10 cents per breath. If only there were other options for certain destinations. Todays misfortune: retiming of flight the day before, only to come to airport, go to gate as indicated and find out there (i.e. at the gate) that there would be another delay on top of a change in gates. Still waiting to board, holiday ruined. Avoid this airline if you can. Pay more, get better service somewhere else.",1
"Flew Scoot from Singapore to Krabi. The departure gate kept on changing, and when I finally found the correct one it said Ho Chi Min City on the Gate display. This was not corrected till departure and caused lots of confusion. Flight delayed by an hour, no explanation given. No announcements were made, so everyone had to guess when boarding starts. The plane was an ex Tiger Air plane, rather worn and dated looking. The food and drinks were highly overpriced in comparison to Air Asia. The 'hip and young' image Scoot tries to give itself looks rather tacky and fake to me. Its a budget carrier well below its competitors.",1
"This is an update on my previous review regarding the Perth - Singapore - Ho Chi Minh Sector Scoot TR9. I neglected to mention that as this flight was delayed by three hours, Scoot gave us two meal vouchers valued at $15.00 each which could only be redeemed at a certain airport store. For the Total of AUD $30 we received two stale egg and lettuce sandwiches and two cheese and crackers, there were no hot options.. Mid flight they gave us some type of childs snack/toy pack. Hardly a decent evening meal and the onboard gift I think was to rub salt into the wounds.",1
Horrible experience with Jetstar airways. I was in a previous flight from Saporro to Narita which arrive at 19:10. Had to run to pick up my luggage which was slow to come out and transfer on their airport shuttle to a different terminal. I arrived 10mins late despite rushing from my last flight and the check in counter people would not let me through. The flight was meant to depart at 20:50 and I had arrived at 20:00. I said I had 50mins left but that did not matter. This has affected my 2 flights from Narita to Gold Coast and Gold Coast to Sydney. The late fee was stated to be about $1200 plus. How ridiculous is that! And unreasonable. I refuse to take this airline again. I booked with another airline at $528 (which is half the processing fee of Jetstar!),1
Bangkok-Singapore flight delayed by one hour without any information or explanation from ground staff or the crew. Boarding messy and disorganised with no respected priorities. Aircraft cramped and dirty despite being a brand new A321 Neo. Very loud music played during most of the flight for no reason. No safety presentation was performed by the crew. Wifi advertised but dysfunctional during the whole flight. A meal is offered for passengers connecting on Singapore Airlines flights but it was inedible and the crew never came to collect them until just before landing. How this airline can be part of the Singapore Airlines group is a real mystery.,1
Indigo charges extra for its seat selection. And now I don't understand why the flight attendant asked me to change my seat which is lower than what i paid. I left with no choice cause its for an child with 2.5yrs. Its crazy Indigo has to fine tune its reservation system. The family who booked the seats got the seats in 3 different places.,1
"Delhi to Bangalore with AirAsia. Knowing that my bags were overweight, I made sure to send a courier back home before flying back. Turns out I was 3 kgs overweight which even an airline like Air India was willing to let go of (yes, I had a connecting flight prior to my Air Asia reservation). When I checked-in I was told that my bags were overweight and that I needed to pay 1200 rupees. Had a bag less than 2kgs for cabin luggage which should have been taken into consideration but wasnt. Never mind the 1200 bucks. No big deal. What really angered me was learning that AirAsia charged a single mother travelling with her 9 year old son 300 rupees to get seats next to each other. I mean, Ive seen inhuman and now Ive seen AirAsia! What level of exploitation does an airline company need to adhere to make money? I mean, how do people who make money through these days extremely cheap and disgusting ways sleep at night? Its a 9 year old child. Knowing that parents will do anything to have a sense of security over their children, AirAsia has done the unthinkable! I urge everyone to share this experience and ensure this airline sees the fate it deserves. Absolutely disgusted beyond words!",1
PLM - CGK with Boeing 737-900ER . Cheap ticket prices. Departure on time. Friendly cabin crew. Distance between the seat is quite narrow. No in-flight snacks.,0
"Nias to Medan with Lion Air, and I arrived 2 hours prior to my 9:30am domestic flight only to be told it had been cancelled and they had very kindly put me on the 7am flight - but failed to send an email to inform me! Then they charged me extra to put my surfboards on a 10:30 flight which was delayed by a further hour. This resulted in me missing my international flight. No compensation, zero customer service.",1
Hyderabad to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. My flight scheduled at 11.50 pm and it delayed by 3.5 hours. I have a transit of 2.5hrs in Malaysia and need to catch flight to Melbourne which I cant catch due to this delay. When I ask the counter person about the connecting flight they said the next connecting flight will be in 2.5 hrs after I landed in Malaysia. But when I went to transfer counter in Malaysia they said the next connecting flight is after 12hrs and gave me couple of meal vouchers. Obviously very poor customer service and most unreliable. Counter people are useless as they dont have knowledge of the flight schedule. I requested them for  lounge entry which they rejected to give. I have spent $100 to book a room in the airport. Should reach Melbourne 8.00 pm local time and I reached next day morning 8.00 am and took day off from my work.,1
"Bali via Perth. Really disappointed with this low cost company especially on the flight back from Bali to Perth where after doing all the metal detector checking, I stopped to get some breakfast in the airport and bought 2 bottle of water (quite expensive after the checking but we all know how it is in any airport) for me and my partner to have something to drink during the flight. Once we arrived at the gate the staff was checking our bags and they made us throw away the two brand new bottles. On the flight there was no water and I had to pay again a stupid amount for a tiny bottle of water. I understand all the security rules but this is the first time that I have this problem and it is clear that is nothing about security it's just a company that want to make you spend more money on the plane in a cheeky way. Will never fly with you again.",1
Jakarta to Solo trip was horrible. Drinks are not given but sold they aren't cold and they don't serve the drinks with ice either. Extremely loud announcements no entertainment. The plane was pretty dirty and my seat pocket didn't have the magazine. In my row only one seat pocket had a magazine.,1
"Business class is definitely not business class. it is premium Economy at best. So don't be fooled into thinking you are getting a business class ride. You will get an old premium economy seat, and economy class food. Yeah, there are free drinks which you need to be able to sleep in the chairs that recline a little, not a lot. Otherwise, treatment of Business Class passengers is the same as economy.",1
"The worst all-round experience we have had. We flew form Manila to Dubai on the 20th November 2019. From the minute we arrived in Manila airport it went from bad to worse - firstly we were unable to check in on the self service kiosks so we proceeded to the counter where there was a relatively short queue with three check-in desks open it took over an hour to eventually get served only to be told we had not booked check-in luggage (luckily we had proof of purchase) as you can imagine there were a lot of disgruntled customers at the slowness of the process. Once we boarded the plane we realized there was no entertainment, no charger ports for a 10-hour flight some form of entertainment should be provided at least for this length of time. There was no complimentary meal on board if you are flying at 3 pm and do not arrive until 1 am you would expect to have some food provided. When the refreshment and snacks trolley came around there were no hot meals available only snacks. We wanted to pay with card and we were told the card machine was not working we can only accept cash - 2019 or 1920? We only had a small bit of cash on us so could only buy one bread roll each (2 passengers) to last 10 hours. On top of this, there was no communication from the cockpit to inform us of the length of the journey, where we were etc. Terrible service under no circumstances will we be flying with Cebu Pacific again. Anyone else flying Cebu long-distance, bring cash, some snacks or prepared to be starved.",1
The most awful experience. The flight supposed to be at 12.05 but they rescheduled it for 14.15 We arrived to the airport at 11.20 fall in queue for another 25 minutes and how surprised we were when an operator said check in is over (only one operator was working out of 7). One operator said check in was closed at 11:40. Another one said at 11:00 ( means 3 hours before flight)? So they delayed flight for two hours and this information you can see online but you must come 4 hours before flight? Doesnt make any sense. Conclusion: avoid this airline. Save your time and money.,1
"Krabi to Chiang Mai. Months before departure my direct flight was moved from 03:00 pm to 8:30 pm. Due to missing alternatives, I accepted this shift. Otherwise I was satisfied with the airline. Small, good tasting food and water as a drink. The flight was punctual and without any special occurrences.",0
"Doha to Manila with Cebu Pacific. Nice budget airline from point to point. My first long haul flight on a no frill airline which didnt disappoint me. Its a unique 3x3x3 seat configuration A330 which normally is 2x4x2. No screen and entertainment, but I bring my own. The pre ordered meal wasn't great but for the price one could appreciate the same. Overall a pleasant flying experience and flying again in three months.",0
"Denpasar to Melbourne. I had a really disappointing experience with Jetstar and will not use them again. Firstly, Jetstar cancelled my flight home to Melbourne without notifying me via email. In addition, the alternative flights offered to me were far longer routes and would require me to stay in Bali for another 24 hours. The planes are also outdated and food/drink is far too expensive on the plane.",1
Tokyo - Melbourne 21 February. A very pleasant flight. The staff were most helpful and friendly. The food was very tasteful and plentiful as well. I was also very impressed by the quality of the wines served. There was one hitch though the coffee served was cold. The IFE could have had a more extensive selection of movies and music. The seat was nothing like the normal business class flat beds but was fine for a daytime flight. Overall I was impressed.,0
My second time flying with Scoot from Perth to Singapore return. Once again flew ScootBiz class. My trip back in January was on the whole quite satisfactory this time I felt a little disappointed. Staff on the outward flight were very slow and lacked any real interest in the job at hand. Flight left on time and landed early. Return trip departed on time but we were held up by 30 minutes landing at Perth. Food was horrible compared to my previous trip in-flight entertainment not working even with the app downloaded on my iPad. Still fairly good value for the money and ScootBiz seats quite comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Staff clearly need a lot more training on how to manage a large flight.,0
Flew on Lion Air both legs Surabaya-Jakarta-Surabaya. Both flights were on time even early. For me whose height 180 cm Lion Air's seat pitch was not that bad comfortable enough. Check-in staff were fast and friendly. I did city check in. Since they have a large number of flights to almost all Indonesian cities and a high frequencies on their routes I will strongly recommend to fly on Lion Air for domestic trip.,0
"Port Blair to Delhi via Kolkata. The check in process required more time than expected. The staff was average. Seats were quite comfortable and aisle access was fair. Reliable airline and never been delayed. Food was available on request and is not included in the flight ticket. In flight entertainment was fair. I would recommend IndiGo for budget travellers, solo and family.",0
"After we had checked in, given up our bag and gone through security we received a text from Jetstar: Flight cancelled due to engineering reasons. Better safe than sorry, I get it. But it was the Easter long weekend there were no other flights available until the next day. It took us an hour to get our bag back, and we lost a day of our Easter break. On the following day the automatic check-in was quick and easy. Service from the ground and cabin staff was good. The plane operated 40 mins late. It would have been sensible to leave passengers in the public area of the main terminal for that time, so they could get food and go to the toilet. But Jetstar called us all down to the already crowded departure area, to spend the time milling about and trying to work out if there was a queue. Seats were comfortable if basic. The airline's take-on bag policy was not enforced -- the cabin crew were imploring passengers who had done the right thing to put their bags under the seat in front of them, in order to make room in the overhead racks for the suitcase-size bags that the airline had allowed on board.",1
I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies  no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.,1
Delhi to Dubai. I have been a frequent flyer with Indigo. I appreciate the timings comfort and services. Most annoying and embarrassing is when you want to pay by card 99% of cases it's declined.,0
"I booked a flight Perth to Melbourne to visit my sister, that flight was fine, and I had two very small bags with me, going and did not have to pay and check bags. But returning the we were all lining up to get on plane, and I was pulled to the side and my bag was weighed and it was 23 lbs for two bags, so I paid $50. To make matters worse, the was a lady behind me no credit cards, just cash, which they would not take, and they said you have to pay in order to get her bag on the flight. The lady was crying and the airline person did not care, airline policy she said, we only take credit cards only - so I paid for the lady. When getting on the plane there was lots of bins empty and empty seats. Once we were up in the air, the bar opens up and they said we take credit cards and cash to the nearest paper note cost of the drink. I have never seen this before.",1
"SYD-SIN in ScootBiz. Booked Economy class but added all extras as Scoot were offering a possibility of being upgraded. This did not happen but I was able to pay for an upgrade at the airport for a very reasonable price. Check in looked chaotic but I was checked in at the sales desk after I was upgraded. Flight itself was delayed slightly at Sydney (20 mins) but on-board the crew were very genuine and friendly and the seat was very comfortable although there were a few issues of lights going on and off. The way some people choose to sit seems to activate the lights which isn't really the passengers fault. The food was not particularly satisfying and because I don't have a tablet device I couldn't take advantage of the free ""ScootTV"". Upon arrival in Singapore I was getting slightly anxious about my connection because added to the delay was a ground delay of around 45 minutes waiting for a ground power unit after the original one (so the Captain explained) was faulty. Loved Scoot and loved the value of ScootBiz.",0
Air Asia Indonesia: Recently travelled from Perth to Bali and Bali to Darwin with Air Asia Indonesia. The airline and staff were fantastic from check in to baggage collection. Can't recommend highly enough. Paid for the Red Carpet option in Bali and this was well worth the $30.00 dollars. The lounge was great as was the complimentary food and drink. We flew with Qantas from Melbourne to Perth and compared to Air Asia they were sadly lacking.,0
"Melbourne to Cairns. Jetstar is a budget airline so expectations should not be set too high. Having said that they should be efficient and professional. The flight to Cairns is just over 3 hours and was without incident, the staff went about their role in a business-like manner and provided food and drinks to purchase. The flight back was not quite as good. The forward toilet had the ""engaged"" light on from the start and I decided to check it out, there was a lady waiting who said that one of the flight attendants said there was someone in there. We concluded that if that was the case then due to the time they were in there they may have had a medical incident, so I decided to open the door. I discovered that there was no one in there but someone had thrown up in the sink and it was still there. In the meantime one of the flight attendants returned and proceeded to reprimand me for opening the door. Another flight attendant was talking to a passenger and was doing so for a large portion of the trip, another was in the last row reading a book. A couple of observations, the toilet appeared to be blocked from the time of leaving Cairns, why was it not fix prior to departure? There appeared to be a lack of service from the flight attendants. No information was passed on to the passengers regarding the forward toilet being out of action. An incident like this doesn't mean that Jetstar is a bad airline. There may be a need to train the staff on their attitude. Maybe their attitude is ""this is a budget airline so suck it up"". Anyway, apart from the minor incident it wasn't a bad flight although the seats are a bit hard after a few hours.",0
"Melbourne to Hi Chi Minh city. Worst airline service. Delayed 8 hours on our first flight of the holiday and only told about the delay via text message a couple of hours before. Delayed due to incoming plane available, how could they have not organised this earlier. Told to contact Jetstar for options which we did and none was given. Staff completely rude and stating they cannot help at all. We lost much time on our holiday and money from travel expenses and accomodation. Jetstar advise that they would not mind if this happened to them and we should be ok with it because they are a budget airline and we saved money. We do not create their business model or prices and picked this airline because of the flight time being the most suitable. Advised that flight times are not part of the contract and they can actually take you when suits them. I would never fly this airline again. We are at the airport now at HCMC and again, received message that our flight back is now delayed as well. This organisation does one thing and cannot do it right. To top it off we have never been on a plane that has had smaller seats. The service, seats and quality is just shocking.",1
"I booked a flight LGW-BKK on 05/22 Flight departing 18/9/22 On the 6/9/22 I emailed scoot to check the flight was still scheduled to leave on the 18th as Id seen a few flights had been cancelled, they just ignored me. 18/9/22 (day of my flight) the Scoot app was telling me to go to the airport. The flight had been cancelled but I had not been informed. They just left me stranded. I had to buy another ticket at a cost of 700, had they informed me of the cancellation this would have been a lot cheaper. I claimed my entitled compensation from Scoot, to be told they had emailed me on the 7th July and informed me of the cancellation (and no its not in my junk folder, I checked with my private email provider) they had not made contact with me, they are basically just lying as this gets them out of having to pay compensation. I asked for proof of this and received something a 10 year old could have knocked up in photoshop, It did not prove anything. They take about 8 weeks to respond to you if youre lucky, they dont answer the phone for hours, when the call gets tricky they just hang up. Whatever you do, do not fly with this airline, they dont care about you or any rights you have, they will just lie. Finally after a year I got my money back but no compensation.",1
"Sydney to Honolulu (Business Class) on 10 February 2015. The moment I got into my seat I was taken down ""memory lane"" of the 1990's. The seat of Jetstar's Business Class was exactly the same seat taken when you're flying Business Class in the 1990's. The only thing that was added were the two in-seat power points. Makes me suspect that Jetstar/Qantas cut corners by re-using the old Business Class seats from old airframes and installed them here. Like the old Business Class seats the in-flight entertainment (IFE) is a very bulky iPad with equally bulky battery pack. The first meal dinner I was given a choice of two dishes. After dinner I ordered for black coffee 15 minutes later my ordered arrived as coffee with milk/coffee. I ordered Scotch after dinner and it arrived 20 minutes later as Scotch and soda. For breakfast I was given two choices: Take it or leave it. This is where Jetstar cuts costs again. Instead of hot meal you're given a bowl of cereals. The seats were hard and I didn't sleep a wink because it was just plain difficult to lean back. Personally I wouldn't recommend anyone to bother buying Business Class as it is really not worth it. I have flown Business Class (Cathay Pacific) and Premium Economy (Air New Zealand) and Jetstar's Business Class is BELOW (in standard) compared to Air New Zealand's Premium Economy. Hawaiian Airlines will start offering Premium Economy starting 15 March 2015 and I will be seriously considering this option.",1
SIN-SYD August 2012 dep. SIN 2.10am arr. SYD 11.40am. The most uncomfortable airline seat I've ever experienced - shallow narrow no headrest no lumbar support small pitch. The food was a very small portion so do not purchase a ticket that includes food. FLY/BAG are the only tickets to consider and bring your own food. Call buttons rang constantly throughout the overnight flight due to their location low on armrests and passengers accidentally activating them when moving in the narrow seats. Never again.,1
This is a no frills airline. The seat had hardly any cushion and my body could feel the seat metal frame on a 4 hours flight.,1
Flew Scoot for the first time and had a very enjoyable experience. The seats are actually very comfortable and already well reclined in its up-right state. I didn't feel the need to recline my seat throughout my SIN- SYD trip. There was sufficient legroom and space under the seats to stretch your legs and ample overhead storage space. I didn't miss the entertainment as I brought my own tablet as had most people. That said onboard rental of a fully loaded iPad at $22 seems reasonable to me. While I didn't try all food on offer I did load up on snacks and I like the flexibility of being able to purchase what I wanted when I wanted. The one issue I have is the positioning of the call button on the armrest that often gets accidentally depressed whenever you shift positions in your seat. I'm not a large person but I seemed to set off the pinging each time I shifted. The downside of course is that the stewards/stewardesses may not be as responsive when you actually want to call them. Overall I rate Scoot and my first experience with them highly and think that if they can maintain standards which shouldn't be difficult given their SQ pedigree they will be a success.,0
"Booked 2 meal service for my Manila to Dubai flight. First meal service was served 1-hour late because purser forgot my order. Got told that my meal was being thawed as still frozen. 2nd ordered meal was not served for unknown reason. Contacted customer care and got response that based on my boarding pass, my meal was served. Either I had short-term memory loss or someone is lying. Avoid this airline.",1
"Singapore to Sydney. I have never been more frustrated in my life dealing with anything, as I have trying to get a fair customer outcome with Scoot. I had booked two seats with extra legroom for my wife and I, as we had a young infant flying with us and needed extra room. Without notice, they had changed the aircraft we were flying on, and the seats I had chosen were not extra legroom seats any more, they were just ordinary seats.  There were more spacious seats available, but the crew insisted we had to pay to change to them. Anyway, that was not the frustrating part. Ever tried to get a refund from Scoot? I will tell you it is probably impossible. You would think it is straight forward: I paid for extra leg room seats -> they did not give me extra leg room seats -> therefore I should get a refund? Not so simple. I had paid $158 for the extra leg room seats, they told me they cannot refund me the whole amount as I had selected seats during the booking process so they had to charge me a seat selection fee (something like $20). I proceeded to tell them that the only reason I selected the seats were because I wanted extra space as we had an infant with us, not because I liked 11D and 11E. ""Sorry sir, it is our policy"", but they cannot actually point to this policy in any of their policy disclosure documents. No one I spoke with seemed to understand the basic concept that if I pay for a service and do not receive what I paid for, I should get a refund. They said they will escalate it and call me back. Three months had passed, no call. I call them back, have to re-explain myself, and they said they will escalate and call me back. This went on for a year (can you believe that). I have called again today, and concede just to refund me whatever they saw fit, guess what? They are escalating and calling me back soon. Oh and another thing, Scoot will never give you a cash refund, only in Scoot vouchers. Why would I fly scoot every again after an experience like this? This is the hardest I have ever worked for $158 of vouchers.  I guess that is what you expect from a budget airline. But at least I would expect fair treatment, which I definitely have not received from Scoot.",1
"I have flown with Cebu Pacific several times in the past, but this last trip was terrible in so many ways. All airlines are getting more cramped because of added seats and carryon luggage, but if you are located in the back by the CR dont plan on sleeping. Very noisy with a terrible smell. It is bad enough that all food must be paid for in advance or on the plane. My wife asked for coffee twice (on 3-hr flight) and never received. This crew was not receptive at all. Next time I fly I will be seeking out other airlines who have better customer service",1
"Cairns to Osaka. They didnt provide the service we paid for saying it was unavailable due to overbooking, even though we have pre-booked and paid extra. They didnt offer a refund and still will not give us one. They then cancelled our return flight and still have not provided our refund for the accommodation we had to pay out of our own pocket. They argued our receipts were in a foreign language so they couldnt verify if they were legitimate, even though we were stuck in a foreign country because they cancelled the flight. I will never fly Jetstar again. 2 months later we are still out of pocket hundreds of dollars",1
"Athens to Singapore. Cabin crew service was excellent despite being  busy. They are kind, sincere and polite, and do their best to meet the customers' requests. The flight I was on from Athens to Singapore was a full flight and the staff was really busy trying to seat all the passengers. Despite that, they are very attentive and are careful not to neglect our requests.",0
"Tried to book a flight through their website. They process my credit card then the next day sent an email stating unsuccessful in the process. But credit card transaction went through. Now to get funds back, it will take 14 to 30 days. The worst customer service I have ever deal with. No support, no phone number or live person to talk with.",1
"Manila to Sydney. Was on a big tour of all the Philippines for 3 weeks and used Cebu Pacific for 3 flights. And every flight I took was delayed by at least 4 hours each time. Every time, the only thing the staff said was: We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause. Never using this airline again just because your sorry. Also on long flights; small seats (regular size as for short distance flights) no entertainment, no included food, no blankets nor pillows available.",1
"Cagayan de Oro to Manila on Cebu Pacific's all economy class A320. Flight arrived at Zhengzhou 20 minutes late, but the time was made up as they overstated their flights time - as usual. Flight was a no frills economy flight, but when I checked in they moved me to exit row seat which gave me a bit of extra legroom and also a nice view of the Philippines travelling from south to north. Arriving at terminal 3 and connecting with another Cebu Pacific flight allowed me to avoid the extreme hassle of changing terminals at Manila.",0
Sydney to Hobart. I try and avoid flying Jetstar as whenever I do they do not fail in delivering a series of delays with really poor reasons. I can only guess they are massively understaffed and only use junior employees. Avoid unless no other option.,1
3 out of 3 flights in one holiday delayed 4 or more hours. Our last holiday had about the same result but we gave them another chance. No more chances for Jetstar. There are a dozen other passengers standing here as well all saying its happened to them so many times with many delays ending up in cancelations after waiting the 3 or 4 hours on the Melbourne to Hobart service. Our experience of delays and cancellations has been Jetstar Australia-wide and Jetstar international. Ground staff are rude and unwilling to help - if you can find a service desk that is even open. This absolute bottom of the barrel level of customer service is just shocking. I highly recommend that you do not fly Jetstar.,1
"The aircraft was overall very clean. With In-flight Wi-Fi with was great. Seats were incredibly comfortable with great legroom. But there was no In-flight entertainment TVs. Their cabin crew service was great. As this is a low-cost airline there are no complimentary water or snacks. The flight was on-time as well. Since this was a full flight, they offered to check my carry-on luggage for free. Overall I am very satisfied with this amount of service for a low-cost airline. Definitely would fly AirAsia again.",0
"Makassar to Singapore via Jakarta. Expensive baggage price, and a crowded flight, The check-in took around 50 minutes, quite upset with the check-in service, but the staff is trying to do their best and help us.",1
"Denpasar to Cairns. Not flown yet and most unhappy. Now on second electronic scheduled departure time change, no problem. On original booking I paid for extra legroom seats. Confirmation of acceptance of new flight time requires confirmation of original seat selection. Final stage demands another payment of the seat reservation fee before acceptance. I am not aware of any European airline that resorts to this rip off practice. Jetstar has no system of communication with a human, only ask Jess, which gives a load of useless questions and answers. Sept 2016 flight date is a dummy to tick the boxes, booking for Dec 2016.",1
Purchased internet on the flight. Connection is slow and unstable. There is no way for you to reconnect back once you disconnected from the WIFI. The price of USD15 for 80Mb means you check up email and finish all the 80Mb data in 5 minutes. For an 11-hour flight from Singapore to Athens there is no free water served. The concept of customer service is non existent. Will not fly with Scoot again.,1
"Check-in desks were over capacity, had to wait hours in the queue only to have it closed on us. This was apparently due to the fact that the check-in employees weren't even Lion Air employees but Batik Air employees that were asked to help them out. It is shameful that such a big airline will organize so many flight to then not have the staff to handle it. The staff that they did have there were extremely rude and disrespectful. Not the first time I have a bad experience with this company.",1
"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. To Scoot or not to Scoot In just one single trip I have come to the following conclusion about Scoot. There is inconsistency in the way they treat seat luggage allowance wise at different airports which cost us a lot. The web portal crashed multiple times when I tried to book luggage ... in the crash dump it said that they had ""been informed"" ... right. Maybe if the portal had worked I could have paid $105 return for luggage for my son as well instead of the total of $540. The air hostesses seems to look down on people, at least my wife who is kindness incarnated. The air hostesses seemed to have no information on extra seats and who is entitled to use them. The air hostesses apparently just assumed that we were getting off in Singapore .... the way they handled the stroller part in the story border lines theft of $400 in my books. It was only that I broke a massive sweat to ""pull it from the dumpster"" that I got my property back. The people in service phone has no clue about prices of luggage, again it seems this case falls out of their flow chart. The customer support does not respond, responds consistently only after the 10 days probably to wear you down and will apparently try and make you give up by death by paragraphs ... but I can read and this has become a matter of principle for me. The main issue was the the fact that we got trapped on the return to Gold Coast with luggage conditions that were suddenly different in Bangkok than in Gold Coast. This cost us A$300 extra  but even though thats a lot of money, there is a certain amount of unfairness to it which is why I am making my voice heard. I have written to Scoot regarding the excess luggage and waited the 10 days without a reply from them. Then I wrote again and have waited another 10 days without hearing anything. But then I heard from them with the following message: ""Our record shows that you have purchased an extra seat for your infant, however, infants are not considered as a full paying passenger. You may refer to our Conditions of Carriage 3.3 regarding infant passenger."" In fact under baggage allowance it says ""Infants not occupying a seat have no Checked Baggage allowance"" which must mean that our son, since he occupied a seat either had a checked baggage allowance or at least was allowed to have one. So, they seem they will do anything to deflect. I have written to them with this argument. And they replied back that they have considered it and that infants occupying a seat still cannot have Checked Baggage allowance.",1
PER-DPS-PER. Positives were cost clean aircraft and a good selection of flight times. However I was concerned with the level of hygiene in the toilets. On both flights soap was not provided which essentially means that nobody was able to wash their hands properly which is poor infection control particularly when there are 180 people confined to a small space for a long period of time. Flight attendants and crew could be more clearer on the PA system as well. Food good but a lot cheaper if pre ordered.,0
Flew with them on PPS ILO and CEB routes on A320 and A319 and they were okay. You may encounter some delays but most of the time I was with them flights were just few minutes behind the scheduled departure. Seats are a little bit cramped up but it's okay for short domestic flights. Was able to fly with them for as cheap as 1 USD and these great deals make Cebu Pacific emerge as one of the best low-cost airlines.,0
"Bengaluru to Visakhapatnam via Chennai. I had a flight from Bangalore to Visakhapatnam on the morning of 6th and my return was planned the same day around night timeframe i.e 9pm. And the airlines sends an email to me on 4th that they had changed the schedule of my flight from Bangalore to evening 5.55 pm. I do not understand , why nobody from the airlines did not bother to check when my return flight was and why they did not call me and instead just sent an email. Luckily, i checked my mail on sunday the 4th, otherwise my whole travel plan would have been jeopardized. And when i call the support number, that person says there are two options - 1. He can cancel and refund or change the flight to take flights with layover in between And when i said i need to be in Vizag in the morning, he suggested a flight in the midnight i.e at 00.05 hours from Bangalore to Chennai and that the connecting flight to Vizag would be from Chennai in the morning at 6.50 i.e with a layover of 5 hours and when i asked if indigo can make any lounge arrangement for those 5 hours, he says that Indigo cannot help in that regard and that i need to take care of the stay during the layover. Since the airline changed the flight schedule, they should at least compensate with an arrangement to stay during the layover -  (if we change they charge difference or if we cancel, they have t&c that there will be percentage deduction in the refunded amount. But if it is their fault they do not bother about what the passenger is going through)",1
"Melbourne to Changi Airport, missed connecting flight TR466 to Kuala Lumpur due to delay in checking in and taking off time at Melbourne Airport by 2 hours. Arrived Changi Airport at 6.30 pm. Layover time at Changi Airport was 1 hour. No information regarding Covid Testing for transit. No clear instruction by cabin crew as to whether to proceed to Terminal 1. No staff at Scoot C-counter. Very confused, worried, exhausted and stressful because Air Asia and Thai Airways staff had to contact Scoot. Last flight to Kuala Lumpur was 7.30 pm. Stayed at Changi Airport till 17/1/23 for connecting flight to Kuala Lumpur at 9.30 am via TR453. The journey was supposed to take approximately 9 hours but it took more than 20 hours to arrive Kuala Lumpur. The long delay and uncertainties as to how and when I could arrive at Kuala Lumpur caused great inconvenience for family members to drive 2 days to pick me up at KLIA2. On arrival at KLIA2, lost luggage, waiting more than 2 hours at carousel. I contacted Scoot customer service but they were unable to assist. After numerous calls and emails, suitcase was finally delivered on 19/1/23. Not impressed at all. 27/1/23. From Kuala Lumpur to Changi Airport, the staff at Kuala Lumpur provided better service. The layover time at Changi Airport was 17.20 hours and incurring additional hotel bills. If direct flights, no hotels required. When boarded TR22, the take-off time from Changi Airport to Melbourne was again delayed by 1.5 hours due to transit passengers from Berlin. Cabin crew did not offer to load hand luggage into overhead lockers unless requested. Food was not served earlier and the meal was only served once in very small portion with additional waiting time of 20 minutes to heat up the food. I felt very hungry. No blankets and cushions were provided unless purchase. Total travel duration and layover time was approximately 26 hours. Very uncomfortable seats and the toilet is small.  Scoot do not feed adequately and provide comfort to passengers. This is the first and last time I will fly by Scoot.",1
"Jetstar flights got cancelled between Melbourne and Sydney on Sunday, 22 Dec. Jetstar sent out emails lying to customers that the problem lies with late incoming aircraft. However, the ground staff confirmed that early morning flights were cancelled. Our boarding time was 8.20am and now it is 10.50am. This has happened on multiple occasions. This will most definitely be the last time we make use of Jetstars disgusting customer service! Hello Virgin!",1
"Hong Kong to Legazpi via Manila. HKG-LGP via MNL flights were on time, understandably enough since it is summer in the Philippines with less possibility of delays due to excellent weather. Return flight to HKG had a slight delay in MNL due to the usual traffic congestion which is not the airline's fault. Purchased 20kg baggage but was allowed with 1kg excess which was a good gesture. Clean aircraft. Beautiful crew.",0
"Horrible experience. Lot more lost in this budget ticket. Going luggage was lost, had to shop locally. Return ticket after surprise cancellation two hour prior was booked again by me to Sydney via Adelaide two days later. No direct check in for luggage. This lady Bronwyn was the elderly lady i met accidentally, charged me another $60 for excess luggage. Felt like dealing to someone made of rubber. Wheres my compensation for lost baggage and cancelled flight wasting many days and hours of calls. Horrible experience overall, combined with poor customer service throughout from Jetstar.",1
Denpasar Bali to Adelaide on Monday May 27. I would just like to thank all the staff that were on that flight.  These ladies obviously all love their work and are passionate about the service the provide. They were very accomodating and attentive and after leaving such a beautiful holiday it was so nice to be greeted with a genuine smile and warmth.  Thankyou for making it such a pleasurable flight.,0
"I was scheduled with Lion Air from Singapore to Jakarta scheduled at 9.20 pm there are long queue in Changi airport terminal 3 from 5.30 pm. We have waited for over 1.5 hours in a que alongside many passengers from other Lion air flight which supposed to fly earlier, then suddenly a representative from Lion Air announced that due to technical and operational reason, both flights is canceled and the passengers are given the option to fly through Johor Baru Airport or Full Refund, many passengers opt in to fly for Johor Baru. The registration for transport in Changi Airport was a huge mess only two counters are open to cater two canceled flight, unclear instruction, clearly confused and unresponsive staff from Lion Air, it took us until around 10.30 pm before we can depart to Johor Baru, they provide a SGD$ 10 Voucher for food, went through multiple immigration and finally reached Johor Baru around 12.30am with hundreds of passengers. They say they chartered a flight specifically for us, when we are there, apparentky they uses Malindo Air, we are then proceed to do the recheckin which took us another hour until at least 1.45 AM, the flight information is displayed that the boarding time is at 2 AM, but then again further delay until 3.45 AM when we finally boarded, but not without a borderline demonstration was held by the very irritated passengers.  Malindo Air ground staff did not provide any clear information about what's going on and not even a water for compensation especially for the kids and the senior age passengers, all of them pretend not to know by turning their back to the pasangers and called one security guard for help. No apology are made by the ground staff or security, they provide a very rude attitude to passengers, and finally after a lot of screaming we boarded the plane and depart at 4.20 AM to Jakarta. It was a very bad experience that makes me to warn every reader to avoid Lion Air at all cost whenever is possible.",1
Krabi to Singapore. I approach the counter staff regarding my powerbank have been confiscated by the gate staff. They put the blame on me as they just told me the powerbank without any capacity on it is not allowed on the plane. And they say its the rule of the Krabi Airport but they never put any indication regarding this until i walk pass the gate staff. Its not fair for me and the counter staff is ignoring me.,0
"Wish they weren't the only airline to fly direct. I'd happily pay more for any other airline and next time I'll double the flight time to avoid these clowns. If the staff at the airport tell you anything about reimbursement, the customer care team won't honour it unless you get it in writing. If you have unlimited time and money to rebook another airline when they invariably cancel, then go ahead. Otherwise, it's time to vote with your cash, book elsewhere.",1
"Air Asia, for me the best low cost airline. Friendly staff, both on ground and in air. Unusual food served in flight (see picture) was very nice and at affordable price. Flight attendants were extremely friendly not like experience I had with other airlines. Captain made proper announcements, again better than other low cost airlines. 4 Star's from me.",0
"Waiting for yet another delayed flight. During our holiday we flew several times with Lion Air and almost every flight was delayed, rescheduled or altered. No problem, price is right youd think but the annoying part is that they dont communicate. You are kept guessing and waiting. No fun if you have a connecting flight ahead of you. Indonesian nickname is lying air. Locals usually are very laidback but if you care to see furious Indonesians, Lion Air can provide. Yep, once but never again.",1
"Being re-booked on this flight I was not really thrilled by the option given as definitely Lion Air isnt my favourite airline. One of the reasons is the poor seat-pitch one gets. Must admit I was pleased to get an emergency exit seat, with lots of place to stretch out. Moreover, I was excited to fly on a Boeing 737-900ER, which is not common (though Lion Air has many of them). With the usual non-existing service (nor offer to sell onboard) I noticed an elevated number of flight attendants. Though flight was quite turbulent, we landed safely.",1
"They have a free cabin baggage policy, but if it exceeds 2-3 kg, you have to pay 250 MYR, which is approximately $50.",1
Scoot provides all the basics that you need at a very affordable price. No complaints. Service was courteous professional and efficient. Will recommend this to anyone who wants to visit or stopover at Singapore.,0
"Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. The check-In was well organized and the staff friendly. The departure / arrival was on time and the aircraft made an average maintained impression. The seat spacing was felt a bit lower than other airlines. Food and drinks were, for a low-cost airline, only for a fee. Overall, a good but not special experience.",0
"Sydney to Ballina. Plane booked 2 months ago, and yesterday we were told that the flight will be canceled. 2 hours on the phone just to be told, we have no solution, we give you the money back and that's it. We had to leave Sydney to go to Byron bay, no solution other than to get there by bus, or by driving. The company are very incorrect and  not professional at all, Never want to be with this company again.",1
"Do not book with this airline. My family and I all booked to go to Hamilton island for my 50th birthday but due to COVID we could not fly, I tried to get a refund and they refused. I had to accept a voucher. A year later my parents are not well enough to travel and they refuse to give our money back, what kind of good company would do that. I will never use this airline again, good customer service would have been giving our money back without the stress and would say I hope you can book with us again in the future however this airline has no such thing as good customer service so I have to get our credit card insurance company to take up this matter take them to court to get our money back. I have 5 children that need my money more than Jetstar do, what a terrible company.",1
"Taipei to Singapore. A terrible experience with Scoot. Firstly, it not available to online check in Taiwan, yet there is no warning given at the purchase. My flight was at 23:40, I arrived at 22:15, the check-in counter was already closed. There was still 1hr 15 min away from the flight off. There was no way for me to contact Scoot Taiwan nor I can purchase the next flight at the counter. It was the worst experience ever!",1
"Osaka to Chennai via Singapore. I'm used to flying with budget airlines so I know what to expect but I think Scoot are ridiculous. Firstly, they changed our flight time so that we had a 20 hour stop over instead of a 1 hour stop over and would not respond when we contacted them asking there were any other flights available. Their policies regarding food (that you are not allowed to bring your own food on board and instead have to buy theirs at extortionate prices) are just mean. Lots of people say that they are not enforced but I witnessed staff telling people to put food away multiple times during my flight. In fact my main problem was with the staff in general. They were consistently rude and unprofessional; when we were checking in the woman serving us rolled her eyes and mocked us to her colleague right in front of us. Whilst were on the flight I did not feel well and asked for a glass of water but was told that water was not complimentary. About 15 minutes later I vomited and again asked for a glass of water but was told it would be $4 for roughly 200ml. Not offering free water for flights that are 10 hours + is ridiculous, but what struck me here was the lack of concern by the staff. She did not ask me if I was okay or make any effort to make the flight more comfortable. Do not fly with this airline.",1
"AirAsia flight, QZ 320 from Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur and AK 711 from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Check-in quite crowded in SUB and KUL, I was unable to check-in online because I was flying with an infant. Cabin staff cabin were attentive, cabin kept quite clean but the toilet did start to smell. Seat seemed quite wide. This plane was nothing special but the price was reasonable.",0
Having recently travelled on uncaring Sri Lankan Airlines it was a pleasure to be back on Cebu Pacific (SIN-MNL.) While seat pitch is restricted somehow the A320 felt more roomy than on UL. The 5J flight crew (all female as is often the case) were very pleasant and had manners unlike some on UL. The annoying Cebu Pacific game is repetitive and the prize of a small pouch hardly anything to rave about. In contrast there is quite a good selection of reasonably priced snacks while the pre-ordering of hot meals has become quite popular. Cebu Pacific flights are popular and in my case ran almost on time which was a bonus.,0
"Bangkok Don Muang to Singapore evening flight. Before boarding the aircraft, we had still some time left to do shopping and a quick bite at the airport. We decided to buy a meal at the airport and took it to the plane to eat. When seated in the plane, FA came to us and told us: 'You are not allowed to bring outside food in the aircraft. You are required to stop eating until disembarkation. Please refer to the terms and conditions when you booked this flight'. I though the FA was making a joke, but she was serious and stood next to us until we put our food in our bag. Then she informed her colleague who said we were not allowed to eat. If we are hungry, we could buy their meal on board. Nasi Lemak 15S$, Chicken rice 15S$ prices are not acceptable for airplane food. FA did not provide us Singapore Arrival Form. You should go ask them. During the flight, the FA were only busy with selling drinks, snacks and onboard shopping. No attention were paid to passengers.",1
Cancelled Flight and informed just one day before. My RT-PCR report and money got wasted. I was also able to do web-check in but they cancelled the flight after that. They should inform earlier.,1
"I am complaining about their seat size. They must be the smallest narrowest Economy seats of any airline. To be squashed up for 9 hours is horrible. They are an extremely budget airline, you cant even get a pillow. The flight was ok and on time.",1
"We got delayed 6 hours from Cebu to Manila. While waiting, passengers were left in the dark for several hours since there was no ground staff in sight, the flight even disappeared from the main schedule board for a very long time. After almost five hours of waiting, a fellow passenger called the airline directly and finally someone showed up at the gate. The ""so called"" AirAsia representative was pretty much worthless in terms of knowing when we would leave. The only way I found out was by visiting the global flight status website which had all correct and updated information! I am aware this is a low cost airline, however, I rather pay more and indeed get some service. Will never use them again.",1
"While I've only flown with this airline a couple of times I must say that their time management is not of high quality. Once in-flight the cabin crew are quite nice however the airlines flight and time keeping abilities are atrocious. Last time I flew Jetstar I was lucky enough to not have a canceled flight, I have found over the years that Jetstar has a track record of canceling and seriously delaying their flights. Their seats are also of low comfort as to be expected from a budget domestic airline. However the cabin crew are very friendly and are always positive and helpful.",1
Bali to Surabaya via Lombok. Lion air first duplicated my familys boarding passes. The flight was overbooked. They then allowed me off the plane to query why and immediately locked the doors behind me. My understanding is that as an air safety rule planes are not allowed to leave with baggage without the passengers. Lion air was not concerned.  Half an hour later I was still waiting for someone to advise me as to what my next steps are. It was suggested that I buy more tickets. This is really poor and not really acceptable.,1
"Flew AirAsia from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau, flight AK6264 and AK6267. Flight was very good and on time departure and arrival. Will fly you safely from Point A to Point B. Hassle free and very convenient. As for the food on board, I will say it is very tasty. Pre-Book meal if you want a lot of choice. Certainly travelling with Premium Flex will give you advantages. AirAsia never disappoint.",0
"Beware not to question Jetstar's money-making tactics. Staff have a zero tolerance policy to questions and will happily inflate a situation and make a scene at the gate to make you out to be the aggressor, even after you paid them their money (the $65 charge for kilos is for real). They back their aggressive staff behaviour rather than their unsuspecting customers who try to calm them down! No one deserves this kind of treatment after paying (twice) for a service. I won't be flying with them again.",1
Goa to Mumbai on Sunday 5-8-2012. On time and welcomed by smiling crew. The plane was spotless and new. The food was reasonably priced and good. Short flight of 55 minutes. At the end the Pilot came out of the cabin to say goodbye to everybody.,0
My partner and I fly with Jetstar regularly choosing them over Qantas because economy seats are more comfortable and the crew generally more friendly attentive and genuine. We are Qantas Club members (corporate) and only have one real complaint about Jetstar. We are able to access the Qantas Club lounge but cannot use the Qantas Club check in facilities. The queues at Melbourne and Sydney terminal 2 are notoriously long and while we all stand there waiting with people stressing and Jetstar staff running up and down the line calling passengers to counters for 'called flights' the adjacent Qantas check in counters (especially the dedicated Qantas Club ones) are empty with staff having lovely personal chats. Why doesn't Qantas Group either use these under utilised counters and check Qantas Club members in or create a dedicated Jetstar queue for these premium passengers instead of constantly annoying us by making us wait for ages. Surely it wouldn't cost too much to implement and would be a fantastic customer service to an already pretty good airline. Just because it's a 'low cost' doesn't mean premium passengers should be treated in a low cost fashion. Also I thought 'leisure airline' was the preferred term for Jetstar - perception is very powerful. Tiger is 'low cost'.,0
"I have at least 4 flights with Lion Air per month. Staff friendly, no complaints yet. Seats narrow, less legroom, for tall people a torture. No meals included, no baggage included. Additional baggage quite expensive, outrageous. The baggage fee can exceed the flight price. In all a cheap airline, uncomfortable, no service, baggage cheating by asking for high fees. No WiFi, no entertainment.",1
"Gold Coast to Singapore. First time on Scoot and probably will not be the last. Booking via web site there is a small charge to pay by credit card but check all your details and add extras prior to travel as it could cost you a lot more on the day. I did receive an email 4 weeks from departure cancelling our flight and changing to 1 day later, after several attempts in contacting Scoot we changed to 3 days earlier (no charge but then had to outlay additional hotel costs in Singapore). The flight departed on time, Boeing 787, bright interior due to large windows, seat comfort Ok for the 7-8 hour flight, reclining seat with enough leg room, behind the seat pocket adequate. FA's were friendly, attentive and spoke good English. The aircraft is under 2 years old but the aisle carpet is very worn giving a cheap feel. Food and beverage selection ok - we only selected hot drink and  peanuts you could pay in AUS$. You board / leave via the runway using the stairs (no airbridge ) and bus, so be mindful if carrying bags and trying to hold on the rail - a lady in front missed the last step and went crashing into the bus - luckily no injury sustained. Overall this is a LCC and as such you pay for the quality and service - if you realise this prior to booking you should enjoy a cheaper way to travel.",0
"I booked the first morning flight with lion air because I had to be in Denpasar at 10:30 to catch a connection flight. Lion air moves the flight to one hour later, this I would have missed my connection flight. They gave me 11 hours notice, with the email sent at 10pm. I finally had to reach Bali with an emergency arrangement through ferry. Avoid this airline, they are horrible.",1
4 of us travelled SYD-SIN-SYD in Sept and Oct 2013. I will definitely travel with Scoot again. Ground staff and cabin crew were great. Yellow seating was great for 6 foot tall family members. We did not use the inflight entertainment as we had good books and ipad for music and we did not eat their food. They hit you 4 dollars for a small bottle of water so bringing your own empty one is a good idea. You are not meant to bring your own food aboard but it seems many do and have no issues from staff. Booking online was fine once I took the time to figure out all the options. We used the Scoot lounge in Singapore and will do this again too. Shower good food wine spirits fruit coffee internet massage chairs all good. We were on time out bound and 30 min late on our return but this was fully explained by the pilot as because of air traffic control. It could have happened to any airline. The planes seemed to be very new. Scoot does it for me.,0
"Warning to tall Passengers, do not fly with Jetstar. If you are tall like me and need to pay for an exit row seat so you can actually fit, do not fly with this airline! Your booking is not secure and you may find yourself in a row behind the exit row with no apologies or option to move. This is what happened to me and I will not take the risk of flying with Jetstar again. Just not worth it. Zero stars.",1
"Jet Star - more like Meh-Star! A budget airline they are not! Unless you literally just want a seat. Im surprised they dont charge you for your seat belt. Went with carry on luggage to Hobart via Virgin who were fantastic. On the way home we flew Jetstar. I promised myself last year I wouldnt travel with them again but thought hey Ill give them another chance. They took me out of line and stung me with a baggage charge - included my handbag weight in the overall weight which slightly tipped me over the threshold. Have a heart people! Might I remind that had I been carrying this weight in my hips or thighs it wouldnt have counted but luckily for them Im light. Im surprised they dont charge a fat fee for the heftier passengers but maybe I wont give them any ideas, not happy with their cold attitude - to match the cold Tasmanian weather.",1
"Very disappointed, I booked business class for my flight, its cost me double compare to economy class but its not worth the value. There is no amenities kit. I just need a pair of earplug to reduce the noise for sleeping but its unavailable. I have traveled with Jetstar for over 10 yrs but this will be my last flight with Jetstar. For future traveller, pls avoid this airline.",1
MEL-HOB and LAU-MEL. Both flights comfortable and the planes clean and tidy. Cabin crew were friendly and polite. First flight left 25mins late only because people could not organise themselves to sit in their seats without rearranging the overhead lockers to suit themselves. Overall pleasant enough.,0
We travelled to Adelaide from Darwin in Dec and the seats were so uncomfortable it took two days for the pain to leave not only was there not sufficient room in the seating but the seats were as hard as rock. All Qantas flights booked out for months so no way of getting to Adelaide. I will never fly with this airline again. Lift your game Jetstar.,1
Flying with Indigo is a pleasure. Clean spotless cabin and always punctual. My trip from New Delhi T-1 to Surat on 6-july 2022 was perfect. Only I wish the Airhostess wish passengers with big smile and welcome message when we embark. Most of the time its a miss. It goes a long way in the feel good factor of passengers.,0
"Caticlan to Manila. I have been flying with Cebu for my trip in the Philippines and every single time, the flight is either delayed or mad rushed with gate changes. They cant keep their story straight with the delayed flights, your plan left Manila 10 minutes ago it should arrive in 45 minutes 45 minutes later, your flight has still not left Manila, it will be leaving in approx 20 minutes. All lies. Waste of time for an airline. They simply just do not care. Poor customer service, unreasonable delays, high costs for extremely economy flights with below average planes. This airline is so bad and I wouldnt recommend it.",1
"Arrived at the KL airport more than 2 hours before as usual and it was a mess. Queued for several time for the check-in counter until staff told us that the check-in at the counter is extra and we need to do the self check-in. We queue for both check-in and luggage drop. Yes, two different, very slow queues because they put together all the flights. One of our luggage was 1kg too heavy and the machine didnt accept it, so we open our things and rearrange it. Once back to the machine another surprise, you cannot try again, so go queue again at the service counter. End of the story, missed flight because it was too late to drop the luggage and customer service unable to do anything outside buy another ticket  for the next day.",1
"The worst airline ever. Paid for an extra oversized bag, was told that was all I needed. When I arrived they told us that we didnt have an extra bag, that wed just paid for an oversized bag not another one even though I was reassured that this was fine when purchased. They then tried to change us an extra $250 for the bag. We eventually agreed and watched as they took off our bag. Which is now who knows where. Will never fly with Jetstar again, no matter how cheap they are. Never have these hassles with Air NZ.",1
"Firstly, just as any budget airline, Scoot charges high fees for necessities, such as bag fee of $40 USD and seat selection fee $14 USD. Once on my 6-hour flight from Bangkok to Tokyo - they wouldn't even provide water to passengers without a fee. It was $4 USD for a bottle of water - something that should be provided for free as a human right on any flight. Thus, I find it highly inhumane that the airline will try to make profit on such simple things. I asked for a blanket (as it was an overnight flight) and was told I'd have to pay for that as well - although most long-distance flights will provide them for free. Secondly, I asked the staff if I could move to an empty row in front of my (empty row) seat for more leg room - only to be informed that I would need to pay more. Later I witnessed a few of Scoot flight attendants take up the whole row that I asked to moved to in order to take naps (as it was an overnight flight). I disembarked this flight with a very poor impression of Scoot airline and will never use them again. I recommend using proper (not budget) airlines, as the cost comes at to be the same.",1
Singapore to Perth. It was a good experience flying Scoot on their Boeing 787.  The ScootBiz cabin is very spacious and the service was really great despite we had to pre-order our food. From check in to boarding it was smooth. No delays at all. All in all I will definitely fly on ScootBiz again.,0
Adelaide to Denpasar. My first experience with Jetstar now set the crown on it. Checked in 1 bag of 12 kg at the airport because it is not possible online during check in processs = 160 AUD$. Confirmed seats for row 18 and ended up in row 30 (the last one) with no possibility to recline the seat on a 5 hour flight. Sitting in a bus is more comfortable and next to us was a huge garbage bag sitting on 2 seats! Customer service says that seats you are not paying for are not designated to you and can be changed at any time.,1
"Cebu Pacific is a typical budget airline: low fares and a competitor for flights in and around Philippines. But you get nothing, just a seat. Anything else you want you pay extra. International flight allow you to bring 23-30 kg of luggage. Cebu max is 20kg, so you need to pay! If there's a delay there is no information! All together, you need this airline to get on the right spot in Philippines but if you can avoid it, do it!",1
"I am writing my mothers flying experience with Scoot on scootbiz. My mother is a 77 year-old diabetes patient with walking difficulty who walks very slowly with a cane. She speaks and reads no other languages but Chinese. Given that shes not a seasoned traveller and with the language barrier, mum felt stressful when travelling on her own. Mum flew with me to Sydney for a short holiday in September and on the return flight, I was unable to fly with her due to work commitments. I therefore applied with Scoot for a special assistance of taking her through the security checking, immigration checkpoint as well as leading her to the right boarding gate as the boarding pass is printed all in English as well as providing a similar assistance at the arrival hall in Singapore. Very much appreciated by both mum and myself and very thankful that the Scoot crew both at the check in counter as well as the cabin crew had been very patience, approachable and understanding of her conditions and had been taking great care of her on the plane making her felt at ease and removing her stress and worries by going extra miles of cracking jokes with her. This is especially so when Scoot had also arranged, at the arrival hall in Singapore, to had her wheeled out of the aircraft, led her to the immigration checkpoint as well as assisting her collecting her 2 pieces of luggage (40kgs in total) which is too heavy for an elderly to remove from the conveyance belt. This high quality of service provided by Scoot which may not be as considerate in other airlines, is highly encouraged and appreciated by elderly solo travellers. Will definitely flying mum with Scoot in the future.",0
"I recently had the misfortune of booking a flight with Air Asia, and it was the most unreliable and frustrating experience I have ever had with an airline and I have flown over 2 million miles mainly on Delta. Not only do they have no live customer service agents to assist with any issues, but when their systems fail, there is absolutely no recourse for the stranded passengers. I was left stranded at the airport with no way of reaching anyone for help, and it was a nightmare trying to get any sort of assistance. It's absolutely unacceptable for an airline to operate in this manner, and I believe they should be held criminally liable for essentially stealing money from their customers. If you cannot provide the service you charged for and you do not have a live person to resolve issues with you airlines you are not operating a business. I would strongly advise against booking any flights with Air Asia, as their lack of reliability and customer service is a major red flag. Save yourself the headache and book with a more reputable airline.",1
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Worst airline, especially the employees at boarding pass. I came 4 hours early, check in online,  the immigration counter asked me to print boarding pass, I went to boarding pass counter  telling them I don't have visa, and asking me for Hotel booking, and asking bank information, and she told me that I can't leave the country, or travel. Most incompetent employees ever.",1
"I was travelling from Perth to Singapore with my 82 yr old mum who has problems walking. I was impressed by the service standards of a budget airline. I requested for a wheelchair when we checked in and was referred to the Service desk. The wheelchair was there in just a short while. We were escorted all the way through immigration, customs etc. My mum was finally wheeled to the aircraft for boarding and we were seated at Row 1. What impressed me most was to find that the wheelchair was waiting when we landed at Singapore. I also wish to extend a bouquet to the service staff who were attentive and really polite! Kudos to Scoot.",0
SIN-BKK-SIN. Easy to see why Scoot is the preferred LCC for this route. Large B777-200 with 31' pitch vs other LCC's A320 with 29' pitch. However on medium haul flight much prefer Jetstar's A330 which offer same pitch but with head rest and personnel screen on each seats. But will definitely use them again if price is right. Just remember to bring my own pillow as I find the seat hard and uncomfortable without the head rest.,0
"Singapore to Osaka. The worst airline I have come across so far. I travel a lot, but never encountered such poor customer service. They cancel flights and you have to run months after them for a refund.",1
"Flew Jakarta to Bali. The delay remains the same. I got a 60 to 90 minute delay today. It is like delays are part of the behaviour and culture in this airline. In this era, where people are very busy and don't have one day only to fly from one place to another, Lion Air needs to learn to respect people's time. So, if you do not have the whole day spare time just to fly, Lion Air is the last choice you should make. I think they have to improve to be on time unless they will lose customers.",1
I have been flying with my wife who has problems walking and needs a wheelchair from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and return. Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip). If you consider all this the price is not too different from what you can get on regular airlines and this will be my choice next time.,1
"Gold Coast to Sydney. My flight into Sydney was fairly uneventful with friendly flight staff but on arrival the back of the flight was disembarked via the metal steps onto the tarmac then up 2 flights of steps to exit. I a mother traveling alone with my 1.5 year old and was my self struggling to carry her and my bags on that route but to my dismay i had to watch a elderly couple absolutely struggle to decent the stairs and then ascend the stairs, this occurred in full view of a male staff member watching on. When  I reached the top I alerted a female flight attendant who went to see if someone could help but the struggle had already occurred. I though it was terribly lacking in compassion and frankly dangerous. On my return flight apart from a delay the flight was fine, when i went to pick up my baggage and pram i found it and many bags piled up on the floor and stuck in the re entry point of the baggage claim carousel and was continuing to stack up and bags falling, no staff were there helping or stopping the situation, when i pulled my pram from the wreck its wheel was broken off and is now not usable.",1
"Denpasar to Bangkok. Very bad refund policy due to Covid19, my flight has been canceled but Lion air refused to refund, only give a voucher valid 1 year. I do not plan to flight for 1 year so it is useless. Spent hours with customer service for nothing. Bad experience.",1
SIN-MNL-SIN SIN-CEB-SIN MNL-DVO-MNL. Flew with them a lot of times no real complaints and since I always take the midnight flights everyone is asleep so it is not really a problem. Check-in staff at Cebu did not seem to know what they were doing and held us for 20 mins while other passengers took less than 10 mins. Early flight departure from Davao to Manila found the airport chaotic (they just opened) but it is not really the airline's fault. Flights were smooth except for short turbulence. Check-in at Manila was quick.,0
"Flew Melbourne to Tokyo Narita, returning to Melbourne via Cairns, my first time on the 787 and it was brilliant. This aircraft is spacious and user friendly and the first time I did not experience any discomfort with my ears. The seats were comfortable. The crew on the outbound flight were distant and disinterested whilst the crew on the journey to Cairns were friendly, hard-working and engaging. The meals were also quite good and adequate for the durations of the flights. We flew via Cairns on the journey home, transferring to a domestic flight to Melbourne on the A321, which also isn't a bad aircraft. The pilots up the front did an excellent job considering the strong winds in Melbourne. Well done, I was impressed.",0
Denpasar to Sydney. Absolute worst experience Ive had in 20 years of flying. Jetstar promised to compensate my friend and I for a mishap they made and then ignored our calls and emails when it came time for payment. Im totally disgusted at how they treat customers and would always recommend travelling with another airline.,1
We flew from Sydney to Cairns return and I have to say it was as good a flight as we have been on with any other airline. The service at the airports was good same as you would expect from any other airline. The flight attendants on the plane were extremely helpful and very nice. We paid extra for the exit row seats and had plenty of legroom as my husband is 6 foot tall so was happy to pay considering we were still saving on the cost of other airlines. The seats we had were airplane comfortable same as any other airline. Yes they didn't have food or entertainment however it's a 3 hour domestic flight so we just took out own food and put some movies on the tablet to watch together. It was a perfectly good flight with great service. No problems with them at all and would definitely fly with them again.,0
Sydney to Singapore with Scoot. Excellent experience and great value for money. Would highly recommend for those on a budget. For those needing extra leg room it is so much better than economy class. Staff really looked after us and it was great being first on and off the plane. No need to stand in long queues and having to jostle past other travelers.,0
My 17 year old son and I were on a 43 day round the world holiday. While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia 29 June 2014 QZ266 CGK-SIN. The whole trip is good. Staff were friendly. The seat was small with little leg room. The Inflight Entertainment isn't very nice.,0
"I just traveled from Narita airport to Bangkok airport on 7th May 2023. That was my 4th time traveling with the airline and I was very disappointed. The counters opened 2 routes, Singapore and Bangkok, for checking in at the same time. It wasn't separated well and was very confusing. The C26 counter was said for Bangkok check-in, so I queued in the row for about 15 minutes aiming for it. But then, the C25 Singapore counter was free and called me out. I refused her because I was waiting for the C26 counter. She didn't understand and asked me why I queued in this row, so I told her counter C26 was said for Bangkok. She didn't believe me that C26 is for Bangkok and walked out from the counter. She realized her mistake when she saw the sign above the counter and the C26 staff told her that her counter was really for Bangkok. Although she realized it, she still didn't say any apologies to me and still asked me to queue again from the start in another row which I was frustrated. I don't understand why I had to waste time there about 30 minutes when I could finish it in 15 minutes.",1
"Wellington to Auckland. My experiences: - $120 to change a flight when the original flight was weeks out from departing. Flights are delayed all the time. Of the 13 flights I've taken, 3 have been delayed and 1 has been cancelled. Not a great track record. - They now weigh all baggage to the nearest gram. $60 fee if you're even slightly over. Explain to me how this isn't a money grab. Myself, a 65kg male with a bag weighing 7.1kg, gets charged $60 for an overweight bag when a larger man, probably 120kg+ has an underweight bag and is considered fine. If this actually about weight cumulative weight, my extra 100g would not make a difference. As said, one of my flights was cancelled. Fine, no worries, it happens. The problem is their customer service and focus, or lack thereof on customer satisfaction. Jetstar informed me that I would receive my refund in 7 working days. Warning: This is a lie. I attempted to fly on the 6th January 2019, this flight was cancelled. It is now the 26th April 2019 and still no refund to be seen. I called them today to which I was put on hold for half an hour and told was there was a 'technical glitch'. This 'glitch' seems a little coincidental when I'm asking for money back, especially from a company that loves to money grab at the slightest opportunity and lies about returning refunds. I digress. In my case, they cancelled the last flight out on a Sunday evening to which I had to spend an extra $100 to get to work the next day - not impressed. Might I add 0 compensation for this. You can tell Jetstar is an awful company to work for and their customer support policies highlight that. The girl dealing with my refund call said 'I'm sorry sir, I can understand why you are frustrated but I'm just following company policy'. I told her that my frustrations are not toward her but toward Jetstar as a company and how they operate. I've been on the other side of that coin in hospitality, I know how a disgruntled customer feels. I expressed to her that my frustrations were not with her, told her to enjoy her day and thanked her for her help. She thanked me at the end of the call for my understanding and to quote, I was the 'first person to ever say that'. Back to the point. This is a warning to anyone else - this company does not care about you. They do not care about their airline ranking. They don't care about providing customer satisfaction. All they care about is money.",1
"My wife and I were booked on Qantas from Ayres Rock to Melbourne via Alice Springs. I checked in on line the night before and all was fine, in the morning we received an email saying we had been moved to Jetstar. When we went to the airport it appeared the QantasLink connection to Alice was not operating. The ground staff did a very good job moving the people connecting through Alice. We were given exit row seats on the plane and A$15 airport caf voucher because of the later departure. I have no problem with Jetstar as such, my gripe is that we paid for a flight with snacks and drinks and never even got water on Jetstar. I think if the airline move you then they should give the same service you paid for. If we had wanted Jetstar we would have booked them. The flight and crew were fine.",0
Hong Kong to Bacolod via Cebu and Bacolod to Manila. Very poor airline. Each flight was unadulterated. Seat pitch is miserable. Check in at Bacolod was a terrible mess and so many extra taxes to pay at the airport. Fares are not budget when all the hidden add ons are included. Will not fly Cebu Pacific again.,1
"Manila to Cebu. Could customer service get any worse? I have flown on over 50 Cebu Pacific flights over the last 10 years and none have been on time! Today I am sat at Manila whilst my flight is yet again delayed. The scheduled departure time came and went, without any announcement from staff. I approached staff and was told boarding in 10 minutes, that was 2 hours ago! The next staff member said flight had arrived and expect 20-30 minute delay. Again that passed a long time ago. The third staff member said flight was due to arrive in 30 minutes so expect up to 2 hours delay! Flights are regularly delayed, staff just make up any excuse rather than give actual correct information to passengers.",1
"Adelaide to Sydney. They operate like a full service airline. The cabin is stunning and they provide almost full service throughout the whole journey, only complimentary food was not provided. Ground staff was very friendly. Cabin staff look friendly as well. Safety demonstration was professional. I was really surprised with the experience.",0
"Flew Newcastle to Brisbane Friday 29th November 2019, delayed 40 mins. On return trip Sunday night flight delayed then cancelled. Rescheduled Monday morning 6am then delayed. Poor service. Staff honestly do not seem to care. The CEO should fly Jetstar to get a taste why Jetstar is so poorly regarded.",1
"One of the worst customer service experience I ever had. Bag drop assistant was too slow on serving as a result they came up with a reason for being delay on dropping my bag, I had to wait on the queue for more than 15 mins. Moreover they were saying flight delayed and whilst I approached the counter lady told me its 4 mins late on baggage drop and made me pay $130 extra for missing the baggage drop. Whoever dealt with my issue were all rude to me. This is the last time I am going to take this airlines.",1
"Siem Reap to Taipei via Kuala Lumpur. Always check to see if baggage is included. I checked in for my flight online and did not see any information about baggage.  I assumed since I was flying international maybe they would not charge for baggage. I am very aware that they are a budget airline but I did not see a place to purchase baggage while checking in or I would have. I think you must have to pay for baggage when you purchase your ticket. Their staff at the Siem Reap International Airport was unprofessional and very unaccommodating, we are a budget airline is what they kept telling me when I asked why I was being charged for my check-in luggage. The baggage cost me $80 USD, it was only 11kg. The cabin service was just fine.",1
"Scoot is a horrendous airline. It starts with a totally useless and non-functioning website. Payments don't work properly. Unable to check in. Every time you log on you have to verify yourself via SMS, even though you are you using the same browser. Scoot's website is the worst of any airline out there. Flights are often delayed. I will try to avoid Scoot at all cost!",1
"Horrible experience with Jetstar Airways from Sydney to Cairns. The staff were also extremely rude. The airline was trying to charge ridiculous fees for carry-on luggage to make up for their cheap flight ticket. I live in the US and usually have no problem bringing a carry-on onboard. But I was stopped at the gate because they said that my lugguge was over 7kg. I was willing to pay the additional fee just to board with my lugguge since I have an international flight the next day. But they gave zero sympathy and said I can only board without my luggage, which will be delivered the next day at some unknown time. They ended up cancelling my ticket with zero compensation/sympathy/solution whatsoever because I needed my lugguge for the next international flight. Ridiculous because this is just a standard carry-on luggage and can definitely fit on the plane!",1
DEL-COK-DEL. Before time arrival on both the legs clean aircraft smiling hostess - what more can one ask for. By far India's best LCC.,0
"They cancelled my flight twice due to the coronavirus, but refuse to give me a refund. I had told them that having my flight cancelled twice has been an extreme financial burden to me. I am a student and asked for compassion from their company. Nobody wanted the flights to be cancelled yet they still refuse to refund my ticket. I tried refunding it through their website but when I tried, they gave me a credit voucher. I told them that I wouldnt use the credit voucher because I have no intention of flying with them anymore. They said that I should give it to family or friends if I wont use it. What kind of resolution is that? Their service is absolutely terrible. I talked to their chat support for 1.5 hours but still refuse to refund it. They can transfer it to a different flight but cant return the money to me?",1
"Sydney to Adelaide. Terrible customer service. Baggage policy waived for some passengers and not others. Very disappointing, after I complained head office thought it was okay for staff to waive policy for some and not others.",1
Flew Sydney-Kuala Lumpur-Bangkok on July 28 2014. The flight was on a budget fare but was on-time at all stops. Food on board had to purchased but quite reasonable. Customs clearance at Bangkok Don Mueang was also efficient. On the return journey in August my wallet was stolen at Don Mueang and Airasia held the plane for 20 minutes while their staff assisted with a search. As my wallet was not located I was without cash when I arrived at Kuala Lumpur. I was very impressed when one of their staff gave me 20 ringgits so I could purchase a meal. Most impressive.,0
Jetstar gets a lot of bad press but this short trip was perfect for what it was. It was well organised from the checkin to the exit. My seat was fine although I wouldn't like to be sitting in it much more than the hour long trip. The flight left on time and arrived on time. No entertainment or free refreshments but we knew that before boarding.You get what you pay for. It was a full flight but the crew manged with minimum fuss.,0
"I travel sometimes dozens of times a year internationally, and this is hands down the worst airline I have ever encountered. Horrible service, rip off checked bag fees, fake smiles from the flight attendants, zero entertainment, and uncomfortable seats. Let me make it simple for you - their fares may look cheaper at first, but they will reach into your pockets and nickel and dime you at every possible opportunity! They charged me $60 for one checked bag (within the regular weight limit)! That is just one-way by the way, not including the round trip. Fly any other airline and you'll be better off. At least other airlines wont keep nickel and dime you, stealing your money like Cebu Pacific Does. You'll end up paying less with another airline just from how much you'll save on the checked bag fees alone.",1
SIN-BKI-SIN Great value for money flying Air Asia from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu and return. On time both ways. Clean cabins good leather seats efficient young fresh attitude staff friendly and helpful. Felt good on the planes. Like colors interior/exterior of planes.,0
My job requires plenty of flying and I am a frequent user of Indigo. Everything is up to the mark the only thing that bothers me is the legroom I will say that it is really not comfortable. Flying again in November with Indigo.,0
Same old problems on todays Cebu Pacific service to Caticlan Airport. Every day the airline cancels flights to Caticlan Airport which is the destination for Boracay island. Normally at least 2 flights one in the morning and one in the afternoon are cancelled. My flight was cancelled today. They re-route passengers to Kalibo airport and then on a bus to Catalan. The airline charges a premium to Caticlan Airport of 50% over the fares to Kalibo and this scam allows the airline to make more money on the route. The bus journey between the 2 airports is circa 2 unpleasant hours. How long before someone puts an end to this? You get what you pay for but on this route there is not much choice.,1
"I bought a ScootBiz ticket, curious to see exactly what you get and if it was worthwhile. Starting with the booking process, you get the promise of a big seat (not a lay-flat such as AirAsia), free seat allocation, 20 or 30kg of luggage and a premium meal. The meal was terrible - probably the worst airline food I've had. Starting a bit early at Changi airport - we were told bluntly that early check-in would be additional cost - even for Scoot Biz.  Neither is internet and depending on what you read - even the streaming entertainment. Once onboard, I found the extra-large seat to be hard as a rock and only reclined a bit - not enough for a comfortable sleep. Yes, it was better than economy seating, but not much. And after 5 hours of flying, a request for a 100ml cup of water was denied - the Scootie insisting that I had to pay for drinks. The staff seem inexperienced, but even worse not having a very good time. It feels like you pay for virtually everything, even in ScootBiz.",1
"Travelled on 21st February the flight was great seats were pre-booked but the food was awful a lot of people complained and left it the croissant my husband had was still half frozen and tasted awful. Lady behind me asked for a cup of water and was told ""you have to pay"". Also paid money to have same seats on the way home a 2 seater were given 3 seater and were told you have a spare seat between you but if someone needs it they have to sit there so why did we pay for special seating. The flight over was great the planes seemed pretty quiet but on the way home with the new Dreamliner it was a lot noisier.",0
"Bangkok to Melbourne. This is a scam calling this service business class - it is nowhere near it, not even premium economy. I have flown with Jetstar on this route to and from Bangkok numerous times since it's inception but this is the last time ever. Everything has gone down hill so much in the two years since I last did it. Check in was a debacle at Bangkok with economy passengers checking in at business desk whilst we waited but no economy check in agent called us up and economy passengers got priority ! Boarding is like a herd of cattle swarming and again no priority. I was most angered by the meal service which was very sparse, linen napkins replaced with paper ones, no second cup of tea, just quickly swiped the tray away. Breakfast was a piece of cake and margarine (not even butter). Really, really disappointed and despite being a frequent and loyal customer I will not be back.",1
"As of June 19, there is no online check in (even if you have only carry on or no baggage at all) so the only way to get check in and have your boarding pass is to have to stand in a very long line to get your boarding pass. I lined up before the counter opened and it took me an hour to reach the counter. The ground staff will allocate your seat on a first come, first serve basis so if you want a seat at the front without paying make sure you line up at least an hour before the counter opens (which is opens 3 hours before departure). Flight was on time and we even arrived 20 minutes early. There is no TV at the seat and no big TV to show you the map, so it's very boring as you don't know where you are and when you will reach your destination. The aircraft was hot, I was sweating so if you have a connecting flight after Scoot, would recommend to take a shower at Ambassador Hotel Transit (you don't have to go through immigration, the hotel is located near the gates in terminal 2&3) for 16$. Yes they are very strict about carry on and checked bag weight. They will weigh your carry on at the check-in counter (it's should be under 10 kg). But they won't re-check the weight at the terminal. Wifi wasn't working On my flight. Overall it's an ok airline.",0
"Singapore to Melbourne return. I took Scoot on a return flight from SIN to MEL and back The departure time was 1:15AM and at 630AM MEL time (or 4:30AM SG time), I was awaken because they were serving the Premium Meal that I ordered.  My Premium Meal breakfast came with Haagen Dazs ice-cream. At 630AM? While serving me Premium Meal, the stewardess was stacking more than 1 meal on the tray and knocked a container of salad from the tray. It fell in between passengers seat. Luckily my meal was served.  The stewardess (while still holding a tray of meal - minus the salad) was on her knees trying to locate the dropped salad. She then get another stewardess to help while still holding the tray of food. And when it was time to serve food to the rest of the passengers, the cart carrying food was being emptied and so a stewardess asked another stewardess to bring extra food to re-fill the card. The air steward bought 3 trays of food and simply just place it on the floor on the aisle. The tray of food was on the floor for a full 5-min before it was placed into the cart. Seriously?  Food is terrible. Why can't I order more than 1 meal per flight? This is an 8-hour flight! Please learn from AirAsia X to see how this can be done. Cabin temperature is too hot. I was sweating on both flights",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. They are absolutely terrible. Customer service is horrible. Staff at Melbourne airport are rude and cold. Jetstar has cheap flights but it excludes basic add-ons like luggage, seats, even food, that by the time you finish booking, its the same amount or even more that you wouldve paid for other airlines. That is total rip off. You cannot buy extra luggage over 40kg. If you exceed your carryon bag by 0.1kg alone, you get charged $60 at the gate. They dont tell you this amount at the time of booking. Its all so ridiculous.",1
Queenstown to Auckland. Incompetent support person. I was misinformed on a booking which cost me an addition booking with extra booking fee and waste of my time over phone. What a terrible company. My advise - if there is not much difference please fly in AirNZ. At least you get good service and money won't go overseas.,1
"Lombok to Surabaya. By far the worst airline I've ever encountered. The person checking us in didn't even look at us, she was too busy flirting with someone else. Just unbelievably bad service. Previous times I've flown Lion air have been equally as bad. Terrible customer service and the flights are nearly almost always late. I will never be flying with them again.",1
Flight from SUB-BKK-HKT-BKK and KUL-SUB. The service was very bad and the crew very rude. I flew to Bangkok and then Phuket and always got a seat that couldn't recline because the button was broken seat pitch was also very bad. The Low cost carrier Terminal in Kuala Lumpur was very bad ground crew very rude to passengers. Don't use this airline you'll be very disappointed with its service crew and much more.,1
SIN-SUB-SIN with Jetstar's ValueAir A320 on 2 and 5 Nov '13. Checked in at Changi and Juanda airports were quick since I didn't have any check-in luggage. Furthermore I arrived early so the queue wasn't long. Both flights departed slightly late but arrived on time. I bought neither the foods nor the drinks during the 2.15 hours of flight so I can't comment on that. The crews were ok. Information about the destination was given by the captain just before landing which is standard for any flight. To sum it up it was a quick hassle free flights.,0
After the food service on my way to the lavatory I pass by the galley and decided to give them my food carton from the food service that was served because no one was collecting around for the trash. The FA said please take it back we will collect later! We ordered the same food for everyone. While the FA was asking for our boarding pass i told her that my nieces pass was with his father 1 row away. She got annoyed and her tone was like she was scolding us that we shouldn't do it the next time we board the flight. The 30KG max per bag allowance can't be split into two-three bags. No wifi working,1
Sunshine Coast to Sydney. The ground staff were like bloodhounds checking the weight of cabin baggage. One passengers combined luggage (inclusive of her handbag) was one kg over the allowed 7 kgs. This cost her $60! I think it is a money-making racket. As far as many of the passengers on board were concerned this is a PR disaster for Jetstar,1
"An absolute disgrace. Less then 5 hours before the flight was due to leave, the flight was cancelled. The only other ""alternative"" flight involved an overnight stopover in Sydney. Avoid Jetstar!",1
"Hanoi to Bangkok. They offer cheap flights, but tack on a bunch of other costs. I tried to get the website to allow me to select baggage but it did not work. When I tried to call the phone number they provide for the Vietnam office, it did not go through. As a result, I was charged 40USD to check a 15kg bag. The staff was rude and unaccommodating.  This may just be a problem with Air Asia in Hanoi. Aside from the booking process. They do not provide free water (let alone snacks) on flights as a low-cost airline.",1
They changed our flight which was scheduled for 4:00 p.m. to an 8:15 a.m. flight. We had no commercial gesture from them.  Because of this schedule we couldn't buy any food at the airport because everything opened at 8am. On a 6:35 flight no free drink or food offered. They forced us to pay for a place to be next to the children (30) when in my opinion it should be automatic.,1
"At every turn AirAsia try to scalp you for every dollar. Examples such as hoping you forget to check-in online so they can charge you additionally, purposefully allocating seat locations (if purchasing more than one ticket) in different positions on-board so that you're more likely to pay the 600THB (per person) to change seats and waiting to tell you last minute your meal option has been discontinued so you have to pay more to get a different meal. We expect more as consumers and preying on the technologically vulnerable is shameful behaviour.",1
JQ5 BNE-HNL Business Class 10 February 2015. Left BNE on time cabin crew very attentive serving drinks on boarding and throughout flight. Dinner served was excellent for 3-star airline value 3 courses served separately with quality wines. Continental breakfast served into HNL. Seats comfortable although reclining only. Booked two seats in centre of cabin and enjoyed the extra room of vacant seat. Can't comment on IFE as we didn't use it. Return flight HNL-BNE on 15 February also very good arriving at destination 25 min early. Reading past reviews there seems to be many bad experiences but we have only experienced excellent flights in BC on previous OOL-NRT flights.,0
"Melbourne to Adelaide. When you book with Jetstar, please think twice! I booked my return flights with Jetstar to Adelaide early with a special price of $104 return. Thought I got a good deal. Have my travel planned and organised. As travel date coming near, they send me an email cancelling my flights giving me limited options of other flight or refund. This happens twice already. In order to arrive on time for a wedding, we have to refund and book last minute with Virgin at over $170 just one way. Everybody, I would rather book earlier with an airline that is reliable than being put in such position of being ripped off, getting a ticket last minute. After I witness this ""sudden cancelling"" situation twice within the past 4 months, I never recommend anyone to book with Jetstar, since their ""so called"" promotional deals is cloud without rain, giving promise of the gift they doesn't realise.",1
"Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia has to be one of the all around worst airlines I have ever flown. I don't write reviews, this is the first. I travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. It takes a little effort to get me annoyed. Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others. Maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where I come from, but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. Being kind, courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. Unfortunately, there is no recourse for me. They don't care. They are so big, it will be hard to avoid them in the future, but I'll will do my best to use other airlines.",1
"Took Scoot for a recent weekend trip from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Price and timing suited well so picked Scoot this time over the usual other choices. Flights were OK, on time, seats comfortable etc. Its a short flight so never bothered with food or any of that. During both flights observed the Crew taking their time to explain personally to the crew seated on emergency exit doors on emergency evacuation procedure etc. so that was quite good. On return to KL from SG, there was high volume of cabin luggage and the Crew really worked exceptionally hard to find space for everyone's bag, dont see that often. They actually moved the luggage and bags themselves to make room. Very impressed with that. Overall good, will try to use again!",0
"Jakarta to Denpasar. This would have to be the worst airline that I have ever flown with. Our first check in online at Jakarta, had the flight on time, but alas we arrived to the airport the flight was delayed 3 hours, due to what they said was technical fault. No service from the air hostesses on the flight, I was glad to get off. Then on our return trip from Denpasar back to Jakarta, another 4 hour delay and  more technical difficulties.",1
Sydney to Sunshine Coast. We got in the airport two hours earlier. There was a very crowed long queue with 6 long lines. We waited in the line and walked slowly in front. They mixed all the flights of jetstar together. They announced passengers of other flights two times to go out of queue and stand in separated lines. This way the queue discipline was destroyed and a lot of people jump from end of queue to in front. We waited and waited and there were 3 ladies in counter. As we arrived to one line before last. Two of the ladies left and only one was there to receive the luggage. We waited two long and then ran to catch the flight. Every passenger of jetstar had stress of losing her flight. I have never experience such an unorganized airline in my life.,1
"Singapore to Penang. Scoot lost me in their systems and put me through queue after queue till the point where the system shut out my ticket and i was forced with the most condescending service to buy another ticket under the guise of an admin fee, its incredible how terrible Scoots service has become since merging with Tigerair and its the most contempt i have ever witnessed by service staff. Not only myself but i am surrounded by passengers with the same issues raging all around me as the service counter queues continue to stretch out.",1
"Manila to Puerto Princesa, Many seats were available. My pregnant wife was in the middle and I by the window. We asked  the flight attendant, if we could move to an open aisle seat since my wife needs to use the restroom frequently. She said she would ask the captain. She came back later and said we could not due to policy. A few minutes later others we're changing seats without asking. Then a person from the rear came up and laid across 3 seats just one row up on the opposite side. No flight attendant ever said anything to anyone not did they come back to us and let us change. My wife had to continue asking the person in our row to let her out. This same thing happened on our return flight although we made sure we were on the aisle. But many were changing seats even though it was announced that it was forbidden. No one was ever talked to including there guy who changed sides of the plane during take off. Both stewardesses saw him move across the aisle. Ridiculous and inexcusable. We will not be using your services anymore.",1
"Jetstar Business class is equivalent to Premium Economy on a full-service airline at best, and even then, struggles to achieve the same standard as QF Prem Y, for example. On this flight from Sydney to Denpasar, food offerings were meagre and among the worst airline meals I've had in over 30 years of frequent flying. Service was poor: e.g. Items not cleared in a timely manner: I ended taking my items to the galley myself (and saw other pax doing likewise). IFE selection is also paltry. And not that anyone else probably cares, but the Classical Music audio selection should be re-named ""Easy Listening"". My dessert choice was unavailable as well: a first-world problem I know. But when paying A$2400 for a ""max bundle"" fare one might be excused for expecting better. No priority tagging of luggage is on offer, so I also endured 40 minute wait for bag at DPS (and also on return to SYD). Basically one of the worst, if not the worst value-for-money trips I've ever taken. Only positives were that flight was uneventful and on-time.",1
"Honolulu to Melbourne via Sydney. The very worst flying experience of my life. I read all the horrible reviews and thought, aw cmon, how bad can they really be? Well, here it is. Booked a non-stop flight from Honolulu to Melbourne scheduled to depart 8AM and arrive about 10-1/2 hours later on October 1st. Arrived at the airport and stood in the check-in line only to find out that the flight was cancelled. No advance notice whatsoever! We were sent away to a hotel shuttle after being assured that we should be rescheduled for the next day and would be notified later in the day in any event. After hearing nothing from Jetstar by early afternoon, we logged into their website to discover that we had been rebooked for 8:30AM on October 5th, connecting through Sydney with a 7-hour layover! So, instead of a direct 10:30 journey, we were now spending 3 nights waiting for a 19-hour journey and all without even the courtesy of a notification. To make matters worse, when my wife and I finally got on the plane, we discovered that we were not even seated together on this wonderful replacement flight and we had paid extra for our seats on the original flight. Plus, it gets even better. Jetstar does not transfer luggage between an international and domestic flight on the same ticket so we needed to collect our bags in Sydney and drag them around the airport with us for 5-hours because Jetstar will not accept bags until 2-hours before a flight. This also meant that we could not get through security to reach a decent restaurant for those 5-hours as well and needed to just hang out in the outer airport by the ticket counters. But this still was not the end of our ordeal. As a cherry on top, we were rewarded by the likes of a very nasty counter clerk who insisted that the very same bags that we had dragged over from international were now 2kg overweight each and demanded another $60! What happened? Did our bags pick up 4kg of grime off the airport floors as we dragged them around behind us for the past 5-hours? We elected to throw out a couple of books and my hiking boots rather than pay these jokers another dime! Oh, and the domestic flight to Melbourne ended up delayed by 20 minutes. Ok, to call this airline incompetent, apathetic and rude would actually be an insult to the other incompetent, apathetic and rude businesses out there in the world and thats all I have to say about that. If you ever have the notion to consider Jetstar for your travel needs, my advice is to Run Forest, Run!",1
I have used Jetstar 3 times in the past two weeks coming and going Sydney to Melbourne and every time they have had delays ranging from 15 minutes to an hour. Tonight my flight Melbourne to Sydney was delayed by an hour and the boarding gate area at Melbourne airport was chaotic hot (no aircon) smelly and didn't have enough seats for passengers so people were sitting on the ground. Reminded me of Bombay airport in the early 80's. More often than not you hear of overbooked passengers from Qantas being transferred to a Jetstar flight but you are never offered a seat on a Qantas flight if you booked through Jetstar and there is a delay. I keep being seduced by the cheaper ticket but really it's just not worth the stress of always running late or having to wait for extended periods in D grade boarding gates. Sorry Jetstar won't be flying with you again.,1
"Tokyo Narita to Sapporo. Before I was allowed to board the flight, my carry-on backpack was weighed. The size of my bag was not a problem but it was the weight of the bag. Jetstar's policy is to not allow carry-ons that weigh over 7 kgs. So, as to not have damage to my fragile MacBook or iPad, I had to carry them on with other items (iPhone, headphones, book, reading glasses) that I wished to use on the flight, juggling them in my arms as my backpack was checked in to the cargo hold. The staff treated me well and was apologetic, it's not their fault.",1
"I have not had an on time with Jetstar over my last 5 flights. They wouldn't know what an on time flight was if it hit them in the face while walking around the runway trying to pick up the pieces of their reputation. Adding to that, they don't even inform you of a delay until you get to the airport - my 88 year old grandmother can send a text message, so surely someone at Jetstar knows how to work a phone.",1
"Terrible. About 42 of my peers and I woke up at 3.30am to make it to the airport to catch a flight from Sydney to Cairns. A few minutes after gathering at the airport the flight was cancelled due to the route being given up for a route to Melbourne instead for a popular AFL game. This meant that my group had to be split up in half with half going to Brisbane and half going to Melbourne in order to connect back to Cairns. After myself and a few others flew to Brisbane, we found out that yet again our connecting flight to Cairns was cancelled and we had to wait a day after for a new flight to emerge to Cairns. This is just terrible, so disappointing from Jetstar and little information to customers about cancellations and reason for cancellation, and barely any notice.",1
"I am blown away by how unfriendly and unhelpful Scoot is. This is customer service at its absolute worst. Cheap, efficient and inflexible. My wife and I bought tickets from Sydney to Yogyakarta. I knew I might need to change my flight for work, but that my wife wouldn't. I explained that to the online agent, who told me to pay extra and get a flexible ticket but because booking together I would have to pay for flexible ticket for both of us, so I did that. On the day of my flight I discovered that I would indeed need to extend my stay I. Singapore, so got to the airport early and asked the staff to flex my ticket. They said they couldnt do it in Sydney, but I could do it in Singapore no problems. We landed in Singapore and the service desk said they could only change the ticket for one month and at a high fee, and that I should ring the 24/7 call centre. I rang the call centre and they had a recorded message saying they were too busy and to use the online chat. I spent an hour on the online chat, only to be told I couldn't change it online because I had already flown the first leg, even though that is what their staff told me to do! So I got up and went back to the airport with my wife to check her in, and make the one month change, only to be told by the morning staff that that was impossible and that the maximum I could change my ticket by was one week. The entire time, at every single stage of interaction the staff were grumpy, rude and every person tried to fob me off to someone else. This was also true of the staff on the plane. I have never experienced an airline that is so consistently mean spirited and where the staff are grumpy.  Unfriendly, focused on being cheap and efficient at the cost of any sense of hospitality.",1
"Kolkata to Bengaluru with Indigo. The whole process from booking through to de-boarding was done flawlessly and efficiently. During the pandemic, the airline made sure that everything was safe without compromising on quality. And even though the fares were higher than average, this was a trip that was needed to be made and the crew and airline did really well. There was sufficient information regarding the destination regulations for each state which was of tremendous help. The crew enforced the safety regulations well and the staff were polite throughout: from bag drop till de-boarding. Thank you for the flight.",0
"Hong Kong to Cebu via Manila. On Cebu Pacific, things go ok until they don't, and when they don't go ok, they become disastrous very quickly! I and two business companions booked a flight to Macau for an important business meeting in China. Instead of trying to make connections on the same day of the meeting, we broke the trip up into two days. We chose one day to travel and rest up for the meeting on the next day. We had a 3:00 PM flight to Manila and a connecting flight to Macau at 7:30 PM that evening. We were at the airport in Cebu at 1:30PM. Our flight to Manila was delayed 3 hours and when they finally told us we would be leaving we asked for help because there was no way we would be able to make our connection. The ground staff helped us by checking us in for the Macau flight and giving us our boarding passes so we could proceed quickly to the departure gate once we arrived in Manila. Then they told us they would notify Manila that were delayed and coming! However, when we got to Manila, we missed the connection! Turned out that no one in Cebu informed the gate personnel at the Macau flight gate that we were coming. The ensuing ""remedy"" made us extremely late for our China meeting, cost of over $1000 in extra expenses we should never have had, and aged us all by at least 10 years. We expected Cebu Pacific to transfer us to another carrier so that we could get over to Macau, but it turns out that Cebu Pacific does not have any relationships of that sort with other airlines. The extent of the ground staff's attempt to find us a flight was limited to scanning airline websites looking for possible flights for us. In the end we had no choice but to stay with Cebu Pacific and let them get us to Hong Kong (not Macau) the next morning. Several days after arriving home I filed a complaint and the result was an email messages saying how sorry everyone was for all the delays and hassles, but that an investigation concluded that personnel followed acceptable procedures in handling our situation. I guess saying that you are ""going to call ahead"" and then not calling ahead are considered to ""acceptable procedures"" for Cebu Pacific. Never again. Most of the staff were very great during our crisis, except for one representative, whom when we first arrived in Manila and were trying to get to the Macau flight gate as quick as possible, we approached for information about our Macau flight. After calling on his radio, he informed us that the plane had already pulled away from the gate and that we would have to ""go outside and buy another ticket"", without even so much as telling us how sorry he was that the company had caused us to miss our flight. Cebu Pacific is good when it is good, but when things go awry, don't expect too much in the way of a remedy. I really hope they change.",1
"Manila to Singapore. My experience with Cebu Pacific was okay actually, the seats are fine and they have a charging port so i can charge my phone and use it as the inflight entertainment, The food though is not that good and it is quite expensive but over all if you are in a tight budget you can choose to fly with this airline and about the meal you can bring your own for you do not have to spend for food.",0
"A small bottle of water is $2. Cup of coffee $4. It is certainly easy enough to bring snacks/food from home, or pick something up from the airport, just be forewarned.  You will pay $50-$80 for any checked bags, up to three. They did not check the weight of my carry-on on the way to Japan, but did for the return flight. And as one of my checked bags was overweight, I had to re-distribute from on to another there at the check-in counter, but that was fine and the agent helped me so I didnt have to pay for an additional suitcase. The seat was very comfortable, but youre only able to partially recline it. There is no video screen, no in-flight entertainment, and the only Wi-Fi we were able to access went directly to their service site where you could order food and drinks. This is no frills but the airfare was $800 less than any other carrier. So even with a connecting flight on Southwest, and staying overnight in a hotel near the airport in San Jose (Hyatt Place, highly recommended) I still came out $500 under any other fare. The days when getting there is half the fun are long gone. But if you want a bargain flight price with nice attendants, excellent baggage handling, excellent crew, Id highly recommend ZIPAIR.",0
Perth to Amritsar via Singapore. We paid $200 more on 3 tickets for getting 4 hours stay instead of 7 hours stay stay in Singapore. But we still had to sit in the airport for 7 hours because flight got delayed to match with the other connecting flights to save money for the airline. I dont know why we had to pay more if we were going to have same flight. We booked vegetarian meals on the booking day and on the day of flight they said they do not serve vegetarian meals which is disgusting that you keep people hungry on the flight even when they have paid for it. When we asked for water and tea on the plane they said thats not covered we had to pay for that too. Ill never get on scoot again and will never recommend.,1
"Really disappointed with Jetstar, booked tickets travelling with a family of 4. Flying from Auckland - Bali (via Sydney), but then they changed it to transit 2 times, Auckland - Sydney - Melbourne - Bali. With a total journey time around 20 hours, and arriving midnight! I promised it was my last flight with Jetstar. No more Jetstar.",1
3 hours delay on the flight Jakarta-Singapore. No information about what is going on delaying every half an hour. Horrible customer attention Service is awful.,1
"Perth to Athens via Singapore. I booked a flight with Scoot in Dec 2016, leaving on 3rd September. A month or so later I received an email from Scoot advising the flight had been changed to 1st Sept, I changed my plans accordingly. Six weeks or so prior to flying I was advised Scoot was in partnership with Tigerair. I arrived in Perth on the Friday, caught up with some mates and arrived at perth Airport around 3pm by Taxi expecting my flight to depart at 6.15pm. I was advised that the flight had been delayed until around 22.15pm and therefore I would miss my connecting flight to Athens and I was to report to terminal 5 at Singapore airport upon arrival. I returned around 8pm, the departurs board revealed scoot at been delayed until 0230am - I hung around until 0130 and decided to not get this flight. I checked the Scoot flights going out of Singapore to Athens and it revealed I would have to wait several days to obtain a connecting flight. I am pleased I never got on the flight and had sufficient money to make alternative plans.",1
Bangkok to Singapore on 30/1/13. Easy check in at Don Muang airport and was given an aisle seat as requested. Friendly airline staff and a good selection of food on sale. A little different to the grumpy lot on my next flight on Qantas from Singapore to Sydney.,0
"Sydney to Gold Coast. Please be aware of the sly and sneaky business practices of Jetstar airlines. When you do a price comparison against other airlines, they look like they have the cheapest prices. In reality, they dont. If you want to bring a bag (even onboard as carry on), you have to pay (in some Virgin and Qantas flights its included). Everything costs extra. And then this The staff were walking around at the boarding gate with a portable scale weighing peoples bags and charging them for each kg extra!! Ive NEVER seen such gouging before. Desperate for money, left a bad taste in everyones mouth. I had 2kg extra and they told me to cough up $65! I will be avoiding Jetstar in the future. I hope you do too.",1
"An abysmal customer service experience. Trying to reach a person for help is nearly impossible, they force you to communicate solely via chat with an automated bot that is of very little help. If you are persistent, you can get through to what they lead you to believe is a human but I have my doubts. They have no interest in attempting to retain a customer in any way shape or form, the default answer is no. I was unable to make a booked flight due to rapidly changing travel plans during Covid times. I hoped I could get some kind of credit for booking another flight but they were unwilling to consider the option, which is certainly their right for the fare booked. One would figure they may have some kind of repeat customer loyalty flexibility or the ability to provide any shred of empathy, but that is clearly not the case. Lesson learned, avoid this airline at all costs.",1
"Flew MEL-SYD on their 787 aircraft. At check was directed to international terminal as aircraft was going on to Bali. This added significant amount time as we had clear immigration and customs for a domestic flight. I had to pay $50 to check my bag even though I had an onward international ticket to the US- this was not told to me when I bought it. On board we sat at the gate for 1 hour while the crew waited for last minute ""paperwork"" so arrival was delayed by 1 hour. Did not even offer water for free so all in all the price was the same as Qantas.",1
"Adelaide to Melbourne. Use baggage rules that make no sense or difference to the outcome to scam money from you. Even though I had check in luggage allowance, my bag was so small and light that I just carried it on. Travelling for business though, so my laptop tipped me over the 7kg limit. So they pinged me $60 at the gate. Never flying with these scam artists again.",1
Ranchi to Bangalore. I received my trolley with broken handle at the destination counter. They didn't do anything to compensate this. After complaining no action as if nothing happened.,1
"5J142 MNL-HKG. Often take Cebu pacific for this route and usually on time give or take 10-15 mins. The only complaint is that the departure gates are a mess. We checked in and were told it is gate 109. When we passed immigration noticed an electronic board saying gate 114. I went to 109 which was packed and asked a CP representative who said yes the flight has been changed to gate 114. Went back to 114 where just a handful of people were waiting and indeed we did embark from gate 114 (to a bus which drove us close to gate 110) and then I could see lots of people scurrying from 109 to 114 so they clearly hadn't told all the waiting passengers at 109! There as mass confusion as it seemed almost every flight had its gate changed. Apart from that it is what you expect no food or drink (and no veggie dishes to buy) silly games which pass as ""entertainment"" to make my flight ""more memorable"" but it got back on time and that's what matters!",0
12 hour delay Perth to Singapore due to weather notified 24 hours before flight even left. All other airlines ran on time and reported no serious issues with weather. Rang Jetstar to ask for alternative flight after fighting the automated voice recognition system for 15 mins was forwarded to customer service. They gave us the run around and said something along the lines of can't control the weather and there may be more delays. A friend in Singapore said rain no worse than usual this time of year. I think it has to do with old technology used on the airplanes so cannot navigate in rain or fog.,1
"Kansai to Kuala Lumpur. During my trip to Japan, I got news that my dad who lived in Indonesia suddenly got sick, he passed away few days later. I needed to leave Japan quicker than planned. Contacted AirAsia and they didnt have any availability anymore on the day, but promised to give credit or somekind of proportioned refund for the original ticket, so long I provided all the documents requested. Which I did, I sent all the hospital letter and death certificate. Now 2 months later and still no response from the airline, I tried to contact the by email a few times already. Bad customer service.",1
"I had an awful experience at check-in on Jet Star out of Singapore. In the air the service was fine, but check-in was beyond dreadful. My wife and I had flown Air Asia from Phuket to Singapore on 14th, and I must say their check in was trouble free. On return from Singapore on 19th, however, your check-in clerk first demanded to see my Thai Residence Card. Of course there is no such thing as I explained to the clerks evident displeasure, and implied disbelief. Then she wanted to know which bag was mine. My wife and I had one suitcase for our clothes, one bag for our shoes and paraphernalia, and one hand bag each. Check-in bags weighed just over 32 kg. I had purchased 20kg of luggage, and my wife had purchased 15kg so I had no concerns over weight. However your clerk insisted that luggage cannot be combined, and that one bag must be mine, and the other could be my wifes, so I agreed that the suitcase could be mine, whereupon she demanded payment for 7kg overweight on my case, despite the total being well within our purchased 35kg. Naturally I was not attracted to her proposal. So then I had to remove some contents of the suitcase and put them in the shoe bag, remove bulky but light items from the shoe bag and put them in a new carry-on bag purchased from Smiths, and make my carry-on briefcase into a check-in bag. This took a lot of time, so your clerk wanted me to do that away from check-in because I was now causing a backlog in the queue. Of course this was impossible, because I needed access to the scales to balance each bag to a spurious amount. The frustration mounted in all quarters. Your clerk told me its not my fault its Company policy. I told her she represented the Company, and that this was unacceptable. Certainly I would not permit one of my staff to say that. We finally got our boarding passes, no money had changed hands, everyone was frustrated, no-one benefited, I was thoroughly stressed, and we had lost all the time we had planned to spend in the airport. Then I saw that your clerk had not given my wife and I adjoining seats. All other seats are taken, and this is the closest I can give you she told me. This was a lie. When I took my seat, both seats next to me were empty and so were the entire two rows in front of me. This was resolved painlessly on the aircraft by helpful and charming flight crew, but I was so unhappy by then that I have vowed never again to take Jet Star if I had an alternative. And of course I regale all my friends with the story. Their response? Typical Jet Star. I do not expect frills with a low-cost airline, but I expect common sense, and some understanding that the passenger is not just a process item. Air Asia is streets ahead.",1
Our flight was first delayed and then the staff couldnt figure out the passenger count for another hour. We were expected to sit in our seats without using the toilets just because they couldnt get the count right. It was terrible and painful .Our original flight time was two hours which was extended up to almost 4 hours inflight time. Once we landed we were made to wait for another 30 minutes before disembarking. The service on the flight is slow. Also we faced turbulence throughout the flight.  Will not recommend JetStar and will never fly with it again.,1
"I understand it is a budget airline. I got the biggest shock of IndiGo's on-time performance. Once the incoming flight landed, they immediately started boarding and even after scanning our boarding pass they made us wait three times at three places, as there were still passengers deplaning from the incoming flight! I was flying with two elderly passengers with knee problems as this took a big toll on their leg having to wait for a long while. This also means they did not even clean the plane at all as soon as the incoming flight landed. How unhygienic! This is how they fly on-time. High On-time performance at the cost of hygiene!",1
"They have the worst website ever! Tried over 10 times to book online with 2 different credit cards and it would never accept either one of them (called both card companies and both said they didn't decline anything). To top it off when called the call center I gave them one of the cards I previously tried to use and it went right through - and they charged me $25 to book it through them and refused to waive the fee. They need out source their customer care to a place where they don't train them to say only ""no, sorry sir"".",1
"Los Angeles to Tokyo. DO NOT BOOK. There is a reason the flight costs are so low. They do not guarantee or stand by their brand. The airline would not allow us to fly due Japan restrictions and would not allow any re booking, credit or refund. Every single airline in COVID times, allowed options. They were difficult to speak with and only available via chat. Spend the extra money and go with a reputable airline.",1
"Thank you so much scoot ground service crew members in Penang with the help! What happens was that I have forgotten about a souvenir small knife in my hand carry, before board the flight they rushing to help me keep my souvenir knife into my small bag and help me check in the bag. Hence my souvenir is back with me. I truly appreciate the help by the ground crew.",0
8 hr delay on flight take off. Land in Melbourne 3.5 hr wait for baggage. Need I say more. I have a nap sack I put under the seat and a carry on bag. AirAsia would not let me take my small bag on. So it got checked. And now the delays. And also last flight broken luggage. Avoid this airline.,1
"COK-BOM. Check in at Cochin a breeze no queue at all. A320 was clean and modern. The flight attendants were active and friendly. on and arrived on time. In Mumbai the bags were out in ten minutes. Indigo made flying fun from Cabin Crew with their Leading Lady and Miss Indigo badges the aircraft steps had painted on the side ""Here comes the hot stepper"". The sandwiches to purchase in a box that said ""airwich"" even the cashew nuts came in a collectable tin which said ""Nut Case"" on it.",0
My husband and I travelled scootBiz return from Sydney to Singapore. Enjoyed the flights both ways and will certainly travel with them again. We are in our sixties and were pleased to have paid extra for the large black comfortable leather seats plus extra leg room. Found the air conditioning on board a bit cool after returned from temperatures of 38*degrees otherwise great!,0
"Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. We booked two round way tickets - Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh. Due to health issues we needed an upgrade to business class on our flight back to Australia. We paid an additional $1584.22 for the upgrade. We were not advised there would be no refund applicable if our flight was cancelled (we have saved the chat history evidence, no such policies were mentioned). Due to foreseen circumstances, the original flight was cancelled and we were forced on to economy on the replacement flight when there were more than 2 seats available in the business cabin. (The response from their customers' service regarding this complaint was there were no seats in business which is not true) We were ensured by Jetstar staff we were guaranteed with business class seats on the replacement flight (online customer service representative and ground staff who Ive confirmed with on the night of the cancellation ). I have saved all the chat history with the customer service representative. The Jetstar customer service representative has given us misleading information. Also in the attached itinerary, it shows our return flight is BUSINESS. If we were told originally that there would be no refund applicable in the event our flight was cancelled, we would not have upgraded the tickets in the first place. In summary, Jetstar has misled us and failed to deliver the service promised and subsequently stolen 1584.22 dollars from us. This is not a small amount of money and it was paid for a service which wasn't delivered. If we didn't pay for the upgrade, we will come home with zero additional cost. After lodging a complaint, they offered some travel vouchers (with time limits) as compensation.  We do not want some travel vouchers as a refund, we need our full payment for the upgrade back.",1
"MAA-DEL. It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",0
"I have flown Jetstar domestically with usual delay issues but this was my first international flight with them. On May 31st (USA time) our flight from Honolulu-Sydney at 8:30am was cancelled. We have been at the airport since 5:30am, at first they said there's technical issues & flight will be delayed by 1 hour then they turned around and said its cancelled, next flight will be the next morning. After waiting several hrs we were given an $8 voucher for snacks at the airport ($8 can barely buy you a snack) but had to wait couple of hrs at baggage claim for our bags. Then they announced our flight will be at 11:45pm that day. There was no speaker system, everyone had to ask others what they are announcing as we couldn't hear a thing. They told us they are organising us hotels & shuttle buses. There were hundreds of us waiting outside for the shuttle. I decided to uber it to the airport which was just down the road (could have walked there) only to arrive and be told we have to wait til 3pm for checkin. Finally when we got our rooms could only have a few hrs rest before getting a shuttle to another hotel where we got a voucher or dinner. But on arrival there was a long queue of people waiting in line! As if we are not exhausted & over waiting. I left and decided to make my own way to the airport. After checkin & waiting at the gate, it was 11:30pm and boarding hadn't commenced for a 11:45pm flight. By 12:30am we were ready and started leaving, then the plane stopped for a while & they announced we have to return as there is 'another technical difficulty' which was another 1 hr delay. You'd expect after a cancelled flight& wasting our whole Friday that Jetstar would have had all day to do their checks & ensure there are no technical difficulties & plane is 100% safe and functional. Terrible customer service & poor communication. Not even a courtesy meal or drinks on flight to apologise.",1
6E 294 and 552 between BOM and BBI - Clean aircraft with decent leg space comfortable crew friendly and helpful good choice of food items for purchase on board. On time into BBI slightly delayed on return to BOM. Only negative was some luggage appeared on the belt very late at BOM due to a mix-up apparently. Overall up to the standards expected from Indigo.,0
"I bought a premium flex ticket KUL-DPS-KUL, due to depart KUL at 1820. The afternoon I was leaving London to get to KUL I received a message advising the flight had been rescheduled to a 1405 departure time! (4hrs 15mins earlier). My flight from London was due to land at 1520 so there was no way I would make it. Because of the time change, I had to call AirAsia in Indonesia and explained the situation. There was a later flight (showing available online) departing at 2020 and asked to be moved on to that. Was put on hold for a long time to be advised they would have to charge me to do that and that I should try at KUL airport to change for free. Upon arrival in KL, the later flight was full and was advised I was rebooked at 1030 the next morning. Also flew DPS-KUL-LGK - had to wait 45 mins for bags to arrive in KL and check in again. Air Asia's online system wouldn't let me do KUL-DPS-KUL-LGK-KUL as 1 booking,  so had to make separate bookings, and the handling agent in DPS couldn't thru check my luggage to LGK. DPS-KUL three passengers upgraded themselves to premium seats and the crew didn't move them back to their original seats. LGK-KUL crew didn't even leave the galley - no service at all - they blamed the turbulence, even when the Captain announced it was a smooth flight. Good value for money but awful customer service.",1
Ho Chi Minh City to Phuket via Bangkok. My round trip flight should have cost me $130. But I ended up spending a total of $270 because they charged me to check my bag twice. They charged me $40 to check my bag from Saigon to Bangkok (a 3 hour layover) and then $57 from Bangkok to Phuket. They said they couldnt let my bag go all the way to Phuket from Saigon for some odd reason.  Do yourself a favor and avoid.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Guangzhou. The 2 year old A320 neo aircraft has a 186 seat configuration. The seats are quite comfortable, although legroom is quite small. The toilets at rear are very small. The taste of food is good. Our flight departed on time and reached Guangzhou 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Generally, we have no complaints on the flight.",0
"Cebu to Melbourne via Singapore. The good thing about this flight is that you fly the Boeing 787 which is a comfortable plane. There are however lots of downsides flying Scoot:  no in seat power, despite this being common on the B787 - seats are extremely narrow, especially the window seat. Scoot charges a ridiculous booking fee per person per flight, which they hide during the booking process - airport tax in Cebu (php 750) is not included in your ticket and has to be paid separately, I find this extremely deceiving - if you add everything up they are not cheap at all.",1
We flew from Singapore to Sydney in August and had a pleasant flight. Save for the delay in landing due to the Sydney control tower the flight was nice. On the way back from Sydney to Singapore we had a nice trip too. As it is a 400+ passenger 777-200 plane the food served was a bit slow but we had a nice breakfast in Sydney so it was a non issue. There were minor blips like running out of bottled water for sale overall the food selection was nice. More legroom and better choice of food (compared to AirAsiaX). As a point to note we flew KUL-SG-Sydney (using FlyScoot) instead of KUL-Sydney by AirAsiaX. We had time to spare and we have no regrets spending time in Changi before going on FlyScoot to Sydney and back. We will do this again in November 2012.,0
"Not really one to write reviews unless extremely impressed or stuff like the below happens on multiple occasions. I'm so sick of this airline, constantly cancelling flights with no viable alternative arrangements possible. ""we have replaced your 2 hr 0 stop flight with a 13 hr / 3 stop nightmare. Cabin staff are rude, zero attention paid to enforcing covid rules. ie wearing masks and moving around cabin. My personal favourite was their handling of the hysterical woman sitting beside me in an exit row. Some very minor turbulence 2 minutes into take off... and I spent the next hr with passenger sitting ON my lap and her arms wrapped so tightly around my neck I started losing circulation to my brain. Apparently this was my problem to handle.",1
"Singapore to Sydney. I am a regular Scoot customer but unfortunately I had on numerous occasions been tricked by the Scoot website unaware of the not very clear and not very straight forward system into paying extras. On my last Oct flight, while I unticked the box of not buying insurance, it somehow was ticked at the final page and I had to pay the extra for the travel insurance which I had already taken up with another company. I just let this pass because it was not a lot of money. On my recent trip in Jan 2018, I booked my ticket to Taipei on 22 Dec and decided to add a check-in luggage on 24 Dec. I had went on the site to manage booking and add luggage and thought it went through and while it was Christmas eve, I had little time to follow up with email. On the 9 Jan 2017 I arrived at Tao Yuen airport and put my check-in luggage and was told I did not buy any and was to pay NTW3660 for a 17kg luggage. I wish to advise those who are not very computer savvy to be very careful when booking online with Scoot, you need to double check very careful each step you tick or enter, they will suck your money and no reasoning. I had many other occasions paid for chosen seat but being allocated another at the airport. You need to take screen shots on every step or they will trick your money. At the end of the day, the fare will come to about the same as a full fare airline so why chose Scoot.",1
"Worst customer service and Chat Bot.  I'm talking about AVA. first of all, AVA gives a set of topics to choose from i.e CoVid 19 Flight Changes, booking changes, etc. If you follow everything right, hypothetically you could reach their actual customer support which I could never reach even after waiting sometimes for 2 hours online. I've been doing this for the past week. Looks like there are many in the same boat here. My only concern is if i cant get my refund processed before my flight date which is on the 23rd April. What happens if I can't reach them?  Wouldn't it be better if we could reach them at a call center instead of chatting with AVA? This is very frustrating!",1
"They cancelled my flight 4 hours before departure and because of this I have to miss my connecting flight, and there was no seats available on the connecting flight for the next 4 days, so have to cancel the connecting flight, for which they cant refund. Receive an sms from the Jetstar to apply for any reimbursement if any because of this cancellation, after doing the same, it was being rejected saying why we have to reimburse for another carrier cost. Who is responsible for my cost, the cancellation was done by Jetstar and not by the other carrier. It did not stop there, they rescheduled my flight to the following day, so I booked another flight from Singapore to India, the rescheduled flight was also delayed 2 hours, because of which I have to miss my another flight as well, at least I was able to reschedule my other flight as there was availability.",1
DEL-COK-DEL. Excellent flight both flights on time as we had pre-booked meals and seats check-in was a breeze. Overall highly recommended as a premium low cost carrier.,0
"I've travelled with AirAsia for years, but this time from Bangkok to Phuket the check-in experience was unorganised. We waited in line for 45 minutes before being told to join the end of another queue. The gates changed minutes before before boarding and of course there was an delay of 1 hour from Bangkok and again when heading back to Bangkok. For our next journey we prefere pay 30 more and enjoy travelling without chaos.",1
"Hyderabad to Mumbai with AirAsia. One of the worst airlines ever seen who doesn't care about customers and who keep delaying flights indefinitely. Never ever travel by this airline as your important schedule is going to be gone, 100% guaranteed. One of the most lowest grade airlines.",1
"Had to cancel my flight because Melbourne went into their fifth lockdown. I added travel insurance for the ticket through Jetstar, knowing that theyll pull out some weird policy and wont refund my money back. Guess what, they still didnt refund my money back even though Ive travel insurance. So please dont pay extra for their insurance rather book your flight through virgin Australia or Qantas.",1
"Wanting to fly 787 was the main motivation to travel with Scoot. Travelled Hong Kong to Sydney with a 30 hour break in Singapore. Flew BIZ which had good seats and leg room. This is a low cost done well with a clear focus on what I find important in a trip. No frills but at a very competitive prize. Check in and boarding was efficient. Food onboard was okay, but did not bother with the inflight entertainment; read a book. Cabin crew well trained and not as busy as legacy carriers. Plane was new and better than than most. At the prices they charge this is an excellent package.",0
"Sydney to Honolulu return. I found the experience quite good, on time peformance on outward and return. As for hidden costs? Paid for more leg room in economy, got 30 kg luggage allowance. Added comfort pack (best ever on economy class, full of goodies). Cost clearly stated, my choice to add on. Entertainment pack added at extra cost, again clearly stated. Meal included just had to pre order. Only problems was a misbehaving passenger.",0
I flew them on Aug 5 in the evening. The flight was supposed to be at 8pm but it was delayed to 9.45pm without any explanation. Finally we boarded around 10pm and we left 30 minutes later. The only compensation was a tiny piece of banana and chocolate cake and a small bottle of water. The flight was quiet but the seat is very small. Other problem: everybody was sleeping on the flight but they kept the lights on full during the 1.5 hour flight.,1
"Bought a flight last minute from Brisbane to Cairns. Advertised price was $120. After navigating the incredibly sneaky website, and paying the fee for 20kg of baggage, I managed to get away paying $150. Little did I know that Gold Coast airport, which is over 100km away from Brisbane airport, can be used interchangeably. So it wasn't until I arrived at Brisbane that I realized my mistake. Thankfully the kind staff at Jetstar did me the favour of allowing me to pay a $50 fee and catch the next flight out of Gold Coast, provided I could make the flight. Please Jetstar, you shouldn't have. Upon arriving at Gold Coast, I promptly paid the $50 fee and queued for the baggage drop. The agent at the baggage drop informed me that I was over the allowable limit for my checked baggage. Being familiar with airport procedures, I said ""Ok, just let me put the excess into my carry-on."" He replied by asking me to put my carry-on as well as my laptop (?) on the scale. He then informed me that I was 16kg overweight. I reluctantly agreed to pay for it, until he informed me that it would cost me $240 additional. So if I were to have taken that offer, I would have paid almost 4X the advertised price at a whopping $440. Thanks Jetstar! I went back to the help desk and there was a lot of hand wringing. And they had the gall to tell me they were doing me a favour by bending the rules by letting me pay the $50.  I've flown with a lot of bad airlines, all over the world, but your extortion game gives me a real appreciation for how good I've had it before.",1
PER-KUL-DMK. Booked ticket 3 months earlier received reminder/confirmation email 4 days before departure 2 days before departure another email showing different times by 5 hours - no explanation just confirmation of flights but with different departure/arrival times. Arrival at DMK (Bangkok) would have had us there 1 hour after our connecting flight had left. No option but to go 1 day earlier and stay in hotel. Chaotic check-in at DMK under staffed 1 hour just waiting to check-in not good enough especially when it's a premium ticket they claim dedicated check-in for premium but no such counter exists. At the end of it all total cost was more than $100 more each than original quote on find flights result page.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. There are so many check-in counters in KL airport that it was not easy to find the right one and then it took about 50 minutes in the queue. The flight was delayed for about 1 hours. As bought value pack I was given a small bottle of water and small sandwich. In addition I bought a seat near exit row, so I felt comfortable and I think it worth the money paid. There was some inflight magazines in English. It's a low cost airline and it it's under 100$ it'd be a good choice.",0
"Flew the MNL-MPH route. Flight to Caticlan delayed finally got on. Flight back to Manila cancelled. All other airlines for the day were fully operational but Cebu Pacific insisted our one flight was cancelled because of weather meaning ""force majeur"" which leads to the next part. The solution was 2 hrs on a public bus at our cost to go to Kalibo then fly to Manila when we could get a flight out with any of the other airlines operating out of Caticlan as they could handle the ""weather"". No refund for the flight cancellation because of ""weather was outside their control""!",1
KUL-CMB CMB-KUL. Flight time to CMB was changed to 6 hours later and return flight to KUL was cancelled. No Refund given. Had to fly MAS to KUL.,1
"Singapore to Sydney. Worst experience ever with customer service. They double charged me and didn't refund me even though I provided evidence. My flight also got cancelled from Singapore to Sydney. My husband, daughter and I were meant to be on the next flight. Waited 6 hours because they couldn't simply generate a boarding pass for my infant. I will never fly with them again.",1
Singapore to Kuala lumpur. Worst budget airline flights I have taken the ground staff and cabin crew were rude.  Not consistent with safety checks. Some people where allowed to continue to use their phones some were watched whilst they turned them off.,1
"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Phuket return with AirAsia . Mobile check in system was very easy, and I can reprint my boarding pass at the airport by my self. Flights were departed on time for both sectors. Pre booked meals were very good and cheaper than when you ordered on board with a free coke as a compliment. Cabin crews worked in the way that they were supposed to do.",0
Melbourne to Hobart and return in A320s. Everyone knows that Christmas week is very busy with long queues at the airport but Jetstar could make it much easier for passengers at Tullamarine by having a dedicated bag drop queue. Then there would be some point to checking in at home. The long queue that I had to join included both people who had already checked in and others who hadn't. After being called out of the queue to catch my plane there was a long wait in the airless dungeon that passes for Jetstar's terminal - then a late gate change which led us back into the Qantas terminal -- and then a long motionless queue with no information. Finally we were able to board around 30 minutes late. Once on the plane the journey was fine. The seat was comfortable and the service was friendly. There was a long wait at Hobart for luggage probably due to the arrival of another Jetstar aircraft minutes before ours. The return journey could not have been more different. Quick efficient check-in and boarding a comfortable seat (I was offered an exit row seat at check-in) and arrival in Melbourne 20 minutes early. However at baggage pick-up we followed the signs to carousel 1 where we waited for a long time before finding out that our luggage was spinning around carousel 4 (with no signs).,0
First and last time I will ever use Jetstar. You get what you pay for with this airline. Flew round trip from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The departure was fine nothing too major besides the language barrier. The return trip-was hell. I arrived at the airport and checked into the terminal at 1pm for a 2:30 flight. At 2 pm the notification was released that this flight and only this flight was to be postponed for 3 hours due to weather that was scheduled to arrive later that night. Why would you delay a flight so that it departs when weather turns bad vs while it's nice and sunny? I went to the ticket counter to enquire about being moved to the next available flight out and of course the next flights to my destination are on time and full. Great. So now my 2.30 departure is now a 5pm departure while all other airlines are on schedule. he attendant says I am more than welcome to book an earlier fight with a different carrier and will be refunded part of my trip - I was 'credited' 92USD not even close to half of the cost of the total trip but it was a refund. I proceed to a different carrier and walk away at the $430 one way option and sadly go back the original carrier after the prices were higher at each different carrier. I purchased the only flight to my destination for $115 - the only open and next available flight. I paid for the same seat twice. I have a seat on a plane that once again is delayed. The departure is pushed to 8pm. While 2 flights to my destination from the same carrier leaving the same terminal are not delayed.,1
"Sunshine Coast to Sydney. Fly anything but Jetstar. Even the cabin crew look like they dont want to be there. The prices look good until they hit you up for exorbitant baggage charges, obscene prices for food, and aircraft which look as tired and haggard as the staff.",1
"4 hrs delayed leaving, given different reasons hourly, now to be told 4 hrs delay on same return flight. You can shove it Jetstar. Staff are still the best, friendly crew. Management read these reviews and do something.",1
"They cancelled my flight in May 2022 from Berlin to Athens 2 hours before take-off. For 5 months I have been trying to get my refund. According to EU passenger rights, they have to refund 400 for the cancelled flight. No way to reach them besides through their buggy and useless online form. I can automated emails every other week that my case is still in progress.",1
"On board you don't get a meal unless you buy it before hand or on board but they will refuse to serve you a glass of water. On the first occasion I have been lucky enough to get a glass of hot water, on the second attempt I have been asked to buy a bottle, but unless you have MYR with you or a credit card you won't be able to get any water. PA s never stop, On one flight i have counted 25 that drive you crazy, trying to get you to buy any sort of things. You can just notice how they save and make money looking at the aircraft: one of them on the inside was covered with advertisements even on the table and the hand luggage compartment. Emergency doors they have two rows of seats on the immediate left and right of them, the so called 'vip seats' where for an extra 20 dollars you have extra leg space. If you are unlucky to seat on row 11 in front of them, your seat will not recline and if you are tall 1.90m like my husband and someone reclines the seat in front of you, you have no space for your legs.",1
"I tried to book directly with AirAsia and there was no way to add hold baggage online on my route Siem Reap via KUL - Sandakan, Borneo. So I booked expecting to be able to add it at the end. Then they wanted to charge 58USD per bag for a 2 hour flight. Then I tried to look up my booking on my AirAisa login and it said I do not have any booking! Then It took a awhile to find the ""other airlines"" bookings. They claim its booked with ""another airline"" not Air Asia. I tried to cancel the booking and their is no way to cancel. There is no email address, no contact number, no chat box. There is an autorobot called Bo, which gives multiple excuses as to why it cannot help you. First it says it timed out, then it said the flight is not with Air Asia but ""another airline"" and they have to check the rules of the other airline then it doesnt get back to you. At the airport, they restricted the baggage to 15kgs instead of 20kgs online and proceeded to charge an extortionate fee for each extra kilo. Then when we checked in they booked all of us including two children aged 9 in different seats all over the plane.",1
"Manila to Osaka. There was very poor assistance in terms of making sure their passengers are on board. We were in the airport 2 hours before the flight which is in line with their terms and conditions. The line in check in counter and immigration was too long and was very slow moving. We asked immigration officers for any assistance but they said a representative from the airline will come and assist us so we can just go back to our lines. Few minutes passed and Im more worried so we tried asking people to let us skip the line as our flight is already boarding, no one allowed us. Then the officer finally helped us. We rushed through the gates and when we arrived there are 2:50pm, they said gate is closed and we cant do anything about it. The next best thing they did after that is just assist us back to the counter which we all know is nothing! They let us sit and wait for an hour for nothing. No more further consideration in terms of our wasted money and time. Even when we talked to the supervisor, all that he said is hes sorry. Just that. It feels like they left their passengers on purpose for additional income for new tickets that well book. If they didnt want that, the best that they can do is to let 17 passengers board the plane few minutes before the flight which they didnt do. It was a very poor management on difficult situations. They let their passengers waste so much money and time and theyre a source of stress! This is not acceptable Cebu Pacific. All for the money. Thats why your customers cant be loyal to you. Because money is all that matters for this airline. They really need to do something about considerations they give to their customers. As much as possible, wont be traveling with this airline again. And Ill never recommend you to any of my friends who love to travel.",1
"Denpasar to Lombok. Worst airline to date. They're never punctual for their flights and always due to operational delay. Terrible service recovery. Why can other airlines do it and not this one? Honestly, they don't deserve my time for a long review. In fact, 1 star is too much of a compliment. They should really think about the management or rather go out of service.",1
Jan 1-12 2015. Flight 6E 414 and 6E 461. BLR to Mumbai return. Being a senior citizen I had requested for travel assistance and was provided very promptly. The staff were very courteous and helpful. Here onwards I will prefer to fly Indigo Airlines and will recommend to others.,0
"Travelled Hanoi to Danang with Jetstar. Online check-in not possible for that stretch. I arrived from International T2 terminal only 25 Minutes before my domestic departure with Jetstar. Jetstar check-in staff was alerted and extremely cooperative to accommodate me on board, despite I had to rush unbelievably. I caused a minor delay of 5 minutes but we arrived on time. As my luggage obviously could not make it, it was, later the same day, with quick assistance from Jetstar, sent with the competing airline, Vietjetair - and I picked it in Danang airport after a few formalities. Onboard on the A320, I found a very good service by FAs. Food, drinks, items for purchase at OK prices. Good value for money, surprisingly professional handling, despite denoted as a Low Cost Carrier.",0
Cebu Pacific has low published fares but by the time you pay for seating excess luggage any snacks including water and Anything else you are paying about the same as PAL. Couple this with the arrogant staff and it is not worth it. After my last trip I have decided that even if Cebu Pacific were free I would not use it. The last flight of my last trip was modified online and changed to a later time and I went through the payment process. When checking in I was told that no record existed and because I had missed my previous flight I would have to buy a new and much more expensive ticket. Having no choice I did so but will never fly them again. Their online booking system is so full of holes that you are taking a big risk with your credit card by using it.,1
Amritsar to Singapore. Worst experience with ground staff. They were very unprofessional. They stop me for me for carrying extra 2kg. Want me to pay 2100 Rs cash only. Ground staff guy  very rude and arrogant. Scoot really need to retrain them. Teach them how to treat customers.,1
"I missed my connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, my own fault, reported my situation and was advised how to book next connecting flight and organise my retrieval of luggage, looking totally confused, I hastily took off to correct my mistake, hopefully. An agent caught up with me and explained it would be quicker and easier for him to organise.  He returned after a short period, having had to run from Gate K to Gate J and return with both my boarding pass and luggage ticket. I was so grateful as he had taken the initiative to go far and beyond his duties to fix my problem. This person should be highly recommended for advancement in the company as he put the company first for customer service which was so appreciated.",0
"I travelled in Thailand with AirAsia, and this time was my worst experience ever. First, they cancelled my flight 3 times. Every time it was a few days before the flight, it cost me more than $300. They've always refused to refund me. You have to know that when you want to get a refund, no ""real customer service"". You can chat with a bot (which is totally dysfunctional) that always repeats the same garbage. Many people have been waiting for more than one year, never saw they money back. Second, some of their practices are very dubious. When I booked my flight, it was written ""check bag included"". But when I printed the ticket, I discovered it wasn't and the employee fined me for my luggage (more than 200 USD) because according to the company, it wasn't ""included"". Actually, when I ordered on their platform, the luggage were included, but the ticket they sent me didn't correspond to reality. I met other travelers when I was queuing up who had the same problem and were fined as well. (No refund/no exchange is possible). To conclude, you should stay away from this low-cost company which has no respect for their customers. They won't hesitate to cancel your flight, charge you extra fees and never refund you. It might be better to take a more expensive company, but more respectful toward consumers.",1
"Absolutely horrendous. Dont bother flying with AirAsia. I bought my ticket on Trip.com. I was denied boarding at the check-in counter by AirAsia, who claimed that I had cancelled my ticket on Trip.com and was already given a full refund. None of that is true. This is a non-refundable and exchangeable ticket to begin with. My ticket was still valid. I was not allowed to check in and was given zero information on whats going on. Trip.com has confirmed with me there are no refund applications made and I should be allowed to fly. I was informed by Trip.com the next day that AirAsia had rescheduled my flight for the weekend. However, I do not have any ticket issued by AirAsia and no confirmation from them. I have emailed them but received no response. I have queued for over an hour on their online customer service chat support but was kicked out of the queue because ""the line is too busy"". Trip.com do not have any tickets confirmation either and this entire thing is a question mark. Im just stuck in Malaysia Kuching right now with no answers, horrible service and attitude from AirAsia and a big hole in my wallet for all the money spent. AirAsia had already delayed my flight by 2 days before this situation happened. I had already rebooked and paid for another hotel, and took another pre-departure Covid test again. Now Im faced with this question mark and likely have to spend more money and time. This will be my last time flying with AirAsia. Do not even bother to consider them. Its not worth the supposedly low-ticket prices. You need to do something AirAsia.",1
Very terrible experience with the check in crew. They wanted me to find a dust bin and put in the extra weight items which were sweets removed from my suitcase. They did not offer any support and the manager threatened me that she will not issue boarding pass if I don't do it.,1
KUL-SIN-KUL. Overall flight experience is fair only. Flight delayed 20 min because one of the crews absence and had to wait for another staff to replace. The staff seem to be moody and not so friendly from KUL-SIN but from SIN-KUL the staff are happy and providing good service.,0
"Bali to Phnom Penh via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. In Kuala Lumpur there was a delay of more than 2 hours. Staff and company gave zero information about the delay. Moved to another gate, waiting for another flight to arrive and than just before boarding gave us a bottle of water, for over 2 hours of waiting. Even a meal does not compensate this delay. AirAsia is a budget airline with next to no service. Booked my ticket online and they charged me 10% for using my debit card, $48. Ridiculous. This amount does not show before you agree to pay. Do not fly. I prefer a regular airline.",1
I was on the very first flight out of the Gold Coast to Singapore and felt compelled to write this review. Originally it was a great service with great customer service but all seems to have changed. The seats are uncomfortable the staff are unhelpful and the overhead light and crew call button is on the seat arm and keeps coming on due to just resting your arm on the arm rest. It is cold on all flights I have been on probably to get the passengers to buy Scoot blankets. My daughter recently flew to Singapore and her credit card didn't work for some strange reason. She only had a Travelex card and no cash which meant she was unable to purchase any food or drink. This is not a major problem but just inconvenient. What was deeply concerning was that the crew refused to let her have a glass of water for the whole 7+ hours! I have found the food to be unhealthy and average considering they are not charging insignificant amounts for any of it. Another word of advice is never change your flight unless you have to! They basically charge you almost the same again to change dates. It feels very much as though they have come up with a great concept and then decided to take advantage of any need such as food water warmth and entertainment and charge for it whilst providing the bare minimum of comfort. Like most airlines they even charge you a processing fee for the convenience of paying them. There is no other way to pay so they are guaranteed income from this. Then they have the add on's such as car hotel insurance and so it goes on! Overall an airline that has a great route from the Gold Coast to Singapore seems to have unfortunately turned into an uncomfortable and unreasonable airline. I will use the service in future due to convenience but not look forward to it as I have in the past! Incidentally I would have given them high scores on all aspect in the beginning except for perhaps the food. It may be better to just get the train to Brisbane and fly out from there in future.,1
MEL-HNL via SYD. Jetstar insist that their own international passengers claim their bags at Sydney domestic and then carry them across to International although they will check bags through for American Airlines passengers! In fact nowhere on the ticket is it mentioned that passengers have to make their own way from the domestic terminal in Sydney to the international - either a bus or a train fare away. The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid. I would suggest that elderly passengers in particular stay away from Jetstar International if their flight involves a domestic connection because Jetstar will require them to claim their own luggage and check in again at the connection point.,1
"Very positive experience with Indigo. Easy baggage-drop at Lucknow airport, new aircraft, well trained crew. Very good airline, warmly recommended.",0
"The Cebu Pacific Manila to Kuala Lumpur flight rescheduled from 5.50 pm arrival at Kuala Lumpur to 12.35 midnight. The staff informed that they have email the changes of schedule through email, but we do not receive it. Can't they also send text to the cell phone to inform of the changes of time? Then, the flight delay and arrived at Kuala Lumpur at about 1.40 am. Also, the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Manila also delayed for about 2 hours. They need to improve of their flight arrangement, etc.",1
"Flight delayed around 1.5 hrs and when enquired about reasons, ground staff answers very rude in Gate 8. Not a customer caring staff in a service industry that too in airlines. Culture of Indigo reflects in this kind of staff behavior.",1
"Sydney to Brisbane. I booked my ticket 2 weeks before my flight with Jetstar using their website and booked my seat (window seat in the last row and i was advised while booking its not a reclining seat and i was ok with that) and paid and all that. I got a confirmation email for my ticket (not boarding pass) on the same day within minutes from their email ([emailprotected]), so you will think everything is good. But then I received a text from Jetstar one day before my flight for my online check in and i decided to check in online and i found out my seat was changed to a seat in almost middle of the plane to a middle seat. I called their number and after waiting for 50 minutes i was told i never booked any seat so they have automatically assigned me a seat(middle seat) and when i told them about the email i was told its an automatically generated email and it can be incorrect(are you kidding me) and i had to choose another seat from the few seats still available. So just wanted to warn everyone as this can happen to anyone and you will be left with not much option.",1
Manila to Singapore. Flight was fine but booked 3 premium economy seats. At check in they couldn't honor our seats so I applied for a refund of the seat upgrade online. They agreed to refund my credit card but that was 30 days ago. They are holding my money and seem to be very slow about issuing my refund. Based on this horrible customer service I will not be a customer in the future.,1
"Check in at Surabaya Airport was good and smooth, boarding schedule time 11.55, actually we boarded at 13.00.  Flight attendant was friendly, sales onboard was good. The food very good tasty, I ate Chicken Sauce Philippines Style and Chicken Hainan, but the hainan tasty was not good for me. Orange juice from Pulpy Orange (Coca Cola Product). Baggage Delivery needed long time.",1
"Both flights from Jakarta to Penang back to Jakarta had three delays, and they canceled two of our flights, then delayed the final return flight to a 1:40 am departure. It caused us three extra hotel night expenses for a 2.5 hour flight. Horrible communication. We were not even informed of the delay.",1
AirAsia is weighing cabin baggage along with laptop bags and ladies hand bags. Any additional baggage beyond 7 kg (combined weight of cabin bag+ laptop+ ladies hand bag) is charged INR 1900 per kg. I faced this at Delhi Airport today.,1
What a terrible experience. Once you have booked your tickets they make it nearly impossible to change your details. Tried to ring them up from Bali to add on luggage and after a 2 hour wait got someone who couldn't speak a word of English. Got to the airport and explained what had happened and was told straight that they didn't care and to fly another airline if I didn't like it. They then charged me $160 for 6kg of luggage. It didn't get any better once on board. The leg room was non existent and my knees where against the back of the seat in front for the 3.5 hour flight. Had to pay for any food and drinks with your credit card and again rude staff. Will never fly with Jetstar ever again.,1
New Delhi to Dehradun with IndiGo. Very superior staff around in here. Happy with the service provided by the airline and the ground staff as well. It has always been a pleasant journey. Great experience.,0
The night before I flew from CNX I spent a good half an hour checking-in via the web for my flight. On arrival at CNX they had 3 flights departing at approximately the same time and only 3 check-in desks open. There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG. All the planes I have flown are exceptionally clean and look and feel new however I regret that Air Asia is loosing its credibility and its novelty is wearing mighty thin.,1
"Brisbane to Nagoya. My booking had me flying to Osaka and travelling by late night bullet train to Nagoya. As I arrived at Brisbane airport I received an SMS stating that my Jetstar flight from Cairns to Osaka has been cancelled. It took 90 minutes before Jetstar provided a solution- a flight on Qantas to Tokyo not Osaka. So I arrived late at night, miles from Osaka and had to arrange bullet train to Nagoya at my expense. This was my second Jetstar international flight that Jetstar cancelled and transferred the recovery costs to me. Behind schedule I decided to return on the same flight but extend for five days. The Jetstar Indian based dialogue centre tried to charge me $630 to change my flight. I rejected and used the ""manage my flight"" option. I was charged $300. My complaint letter to Jetstar was acknowledged, by a corporate apologist who stated that I had changed my return route. I hadn't changed my route - I changed the day. The excuse for their cancellation was unavoidable technical difficulties. So my experience with Jetstar is two cancelled flights with no apology or compensation for the extra costs. This airline is highly unreliable carrier with an arrogant culture and devious selling practices.",1
"Queenstown to Auckland. Jetstar imposes a highly restrictive and inflexible baggage weight policy. Jetstar does clearly articulate the requirements that must be met to avoid their unreasonable excess baggage weight fees, but if you are unaware and are over their limit, you will be unpleasantly surprised. In my case, my carry on bag was 12 Kg, 5 Kg above their 7 Kg maximum. I could not fit anymore items into my checked baggage to offset this weight. So, Jetstar charged me, not for the excess (5 Kg), but for the whole 12 Kg at NZD 15/Kg or NZD 180! This was far more than the cost of my seat on the flight from Queenstown to Auckland. The whole experience was the only blemish on a fantastic 2-week trip throughout New Zealand. My suggestion to future Jetstar passengers: travel with a portable luggage scale or consider flying with an airline that is more customer-oriented than Jetstar.",1
"I flew 4 times in two weeks with this airline. Narita to Cairns Cairns to Sydney Sydney to Melbourne Melbourne to Japan. At Narita Airport the staff were friendly I would expect nothing less in Japan. Australia is where the drop in service is found. The first few flights were fine. Staff seemed a bit unfriendly. Melbourne was a whole other story. Ticket counter staff: The staff were chatting with each other and did not notice me standing in the economy line. The girl took my passport without a greeting and continued talking to her co-worker. In a condescending tone said ""You know this flight is 2 hours late right?"" Never an apology for the inconvenience. I was given my ticket with no explanation about where the gates were or how to handle this delay. I decided to wait at the gate and get information there. The 11pm flight now said 1.30 departure with ""Closed"" next to it. I had no idea what this meant and other customers seemed confused as well. My ticket said 12.30 boarding in pen so I just waited. At 12.45 a gate staff member came to the gate but made no announcements. At 12.50 we find out they will start boarding at 110 once the plane has been deplaned. Boarding: The female gate attendant at least said thank you to each customer the male said nothing. Just scanned all of the boarding passes like a robot. I was surprised they never checked our passports even though it was an international flight. Flight: The flight had about 100 people. The airplane could probably hold about 340 people. Still all the customers were assigned seats right next to each other. The flight crew announced that ""You may notice how empty the flight is. Please wait until we are in the air to choose new seats."" Once we were on the plane the pilot needed to get the weights and the flight crew needed to remember where meal customers were seated so they prohibited seat changing. Very poor customer service by airport staff! Flight: The seats were actually very comfortable. My intention was to sleep through the flight. Unfortunately my ticket said meal on it unbeknownst to me so 2 hours into my sleep the flight attendant jabbed my arm to wake me up and give me the food. Her exact words? ""You ordered the meal."" As we were landing the flight crew (not the pilot) made an announcement to thank us for flying and finally apologized for the delayed time. All in all - not the best experience. The food was good. The IPAD rental is ridiculously expensive and from what I heard doesn't offer a lot of selection. The flight attendants seems rushed or irritated when they did their jobs. The ticket staff were unfriendly. I'll fly Jetstar for the price but never for the service.",1
SIN-SYD-SIN in Nov 2012. Sat in rows 24 D-G and 25 D-G to and fro. Paid $30 more per seat per person per way. Decent leg room. Satisfied with their service. Served food 4 hours after take off at 2am which was just right. The food was piping hot. The crew were polite efficient and professional. The aircraft was clean and new. The crew will periodically inspect the toilets to ensure cleanliness. Will definitely travel with scoot again. Scoot has full cost carrier service at the price of a budget airline!,0
"Sydney to Singapore. I found Scoot to be better than some other economy airlines. Check in was quick and easy, the flight was on time, staff and cabin crew courteous and friendly, and prices for on board menus we're fine. A great experience and I will definitely travel Scoot again.",0
Nightmare experience. Booked return tickets for family from Sydney to Auckland. They cancelled return flights day before midnight without reasons and asked to reschedule flights. Had to travel next day as all flights were booked. We had to rebook accomodation and wear meals and other expenses. They has asked us to submit claim for reimbursements with receipts which we did. Been chasing for refund for last 2 months - called them 100 times. Then suddenly they closed the file without notifying me and did not refund my claim. What kind of treatment is this Jetstar! I did not cancel my flight and request you to change my flight. You made me run like a fool for 2 months chasing for refund and you have closed my case without even bothered to inform me nor refund my expenses. If you are not keen to refund then please tell public straightaway. I will never ever travel on Jetstar or Qantas in my life.,1
"Knowing that the flight was full, Scoot assigned me and my family seats for free when I was supposed to pay. Upon check-in, I was met by a stern and unfriendly ground staff member, and that unfriendliness continued with the ground staff handling the boarding gate. They looked depressed, pressured, and tired as if they hated their job. However, once on board, the team of flight attendants changed the mood of the flight. They ensured everyone was well looked after with their positive attitude throughout the flight. The seats gave me extra few inches of legroom and were surprisingly comfortable. That, combined with the A320NEO's new cabin feel, was a perfect recipe for a clean, comfortable, and awesome flight. The in-flight entertainment was rich in content and easy to use, however, being a Wi-Fi-based entertainment used by many people on the flight, the signal strength was incredibly weak. That, and the less-than-good ground staff team at Yogyakarta, were the only two things preventing this flight from getting a solid 10/10. The landing was around 10 minutes ahead of schedule, and the ground staff team in Singapore quickly arranged our bags at a special spot thanks to the long immigration queue in Singapore. Low-cost flying can be identic with no-frills yet dismaying service, lousy products, and pay-tons-of-bucks-for-everything. On Scoot, this wasn't the case for me, and they truly deserve the awards they've just obtained.",0
Normally reliable however do not use Jetstar to fly to Bali from Darwin. On two occasions the flight has either been extremely delayed or in this case cancelled. There was little communication with passengers the board just switched to a different time which happened to be 5 hours later. All we got was a $50 off our next flight voucher which expires by end of the year.,1
"Horrible customer service. Bought the ticket the same day as the flight and I wasnt able to check in because I was too late. Went to the counter and I was told to call the help desk. Call help desk told me to cancel my flight and get 10% back of what I paid and book a new flight at full price. Because they couldnt do anything else all thought the next flight had empty seats. Overall bad experience, nobody care to help out.",1
"Scoot was the worst budget airline I encounter. I recently took Scoot airlines from Singapore to Penang (Malaysia) on 17 Jun'22. As I have checked in my luggage and upon arrival, my luggage was spoilt. So, I made a complain to the ground staff and was requested to fill up the form for claim. Since then, I have been following up numerous time and it is already more than 1 month and yet to get any reply.",1
Travelling domestically and flight was delayed for 3.5 hours. Never once were passengers advised of why flight was delayed or when it could be expected to depart. Constantly changing departure times up on electronic displays. Staff surly and uninformed as to details of delay or when flight was to depart. Customer service and simple communication seriously lacking. 3rd bad experience. Will never fly them again.,1
"Perth to Denpasar Bali booked for 2nd December. Waited on hold the day before flight was cancelled to be told your flight tomorrow will depart as scheduled. Needless to say flight didn't go anywhere. I asked air Asia on the phone if there was any way that I could fly from my original departure city (Perth) - to anywhere in Asia within two weeks - was told no that is not possible by the most useless manager. Offered to change my flight to some time within 28 days to Bali (original route). After arguing for a refund for over two hours, I was offered no refund. Two days later AirAsia release a statement that they're going to offer everyone who bought tickets for this flight full refunds. 17 days, 3 emails, 3 phone calls, 2 Facebook conversations later, and several failed attempts to use the down for maintenance Air Asia app and website, I still have no refund.",1
"The airline cancelled flight few hours before boarding time and than gave option after 2 days which impacted all my tourism plans. Then gave very basic support on hotel accommodation. After that refund process also very complicated, for a simple thing like spend that customer had to do for 2 days before waiting for flight",1
"Booked with Jetstar 3 days before my flight. Received no email with confirmations or anything, no itinerary no nothing. Checked again later and still nothing. On the day I had to buy new flights with Air NZ because I couldn't confirm I had a booking with Jetstar. Called for a refund and spoke to a potato of a human that had no idea he was at work, no refund, no English, no service.",1
"Jetstar Flight JQ44 - Denpasar to Melbourne on 4 May 2017. Jetstar Denpasar staff started boarding the aircraft approx. 50 minutes before scheduled departure (which was good, this avoiding the usual boarding crush/rush) enabling the flight to depart right on time. A new aircraft - clean - comfortable seating for economy. Not much leg room, but which airline does provide a lot of legroom in the Economy cabin. We prepaid our Entertainment. A reasonable selection of movies, TV programs. Nice size screen & easy to operate. We had also preordered a meal for this flight for $24. Cabin crew stated handing out meals not long after takeoff, so it was really a very early dinner. The serving size (roast chicken) was very small, but the actual quality was very good. In addition to the chicken, we received a cup of water and a small chocolate bar. Not particularly good value. Flight was very comfortable. We had a spare seat next to us, so that was good. The aircraft is very quiet. Clean toilets. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. Overall a very good flight.",0
"Sydney to Melbourne. My parents: 67 and 64 year old, my step-father having difficulties walking had the worst  experience on the way back from Sydney. First, their flight was delayed (I have e-mail proof of that). Second, at the airport Jetstar changed flight to the initial time without informing waiting passengers (delay was for 3 hours. My parents wandered off from the gate to have something to eat as my step-father has diabetes). Then, Jetstar called them to tell them they missed their flight. Jetstar demanded proof that flight was delayed. Apparently, my parents were supposed to take photos of screens.  From this moment everything went from bad to worse: Customer Service at Sydney were rude and did not help my parents a lot. When my step-dad got agitated, the Jetstar lady at the gate threatened to keep them stranded. Eventually, my parents were put on a very late flight and diverted to Avalon Airport. I will not put them on JetStar flight ever again.",1
Sydney to Phuket. We paid for the max package We had to change our dates of flight and when booking is part of the max package at no charge. When we change them they charged an extra $400 approximately because apparently fares had gone up but were actually cheaper on their web site. Only extra leg room is the front row. Waste of time. Received meal 1 hour into 9 hour flight. Always trying to up sell you products. Personally Id never use them again totally disappointing way to start your holiday,1
"Puerto Princesa to Sydney via Manila. We had booked our tickets a couple of months before the date. Due to the volcano near Manila we decided to cancel our flight and book another flight via Singapore and Bali to Sydney. We paid a cancellation fee of 32.5%, and now we are waiting for our refund. But they only want to give us a travel fund, but we don't need more flights. We are heading home to the Netherlands soon. The travel fund is only for us, we cannot book for others and is ending at the 17th of April, then our money is gone.  Never again.",1
"Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. As usual, Air Asia is a serious and comfortable company. The prices are very interesting, I have always used this company for 10 years from Bangkok to different destinations in Asia. I have never known any problems, continue like that, thank you. FR: Comme d'habitude, Air Asia est une compagnie srieuse et confortable. Les prix proposs sont trs intressant, j'utilise toujours depuis 10 ans cette compagnie depuis Bangkok vers diffrentes destinations en Asie. Je n'ai jamais connu le moindre problmes, continuer comme cela, merci.",0
"Departure from Kuala Lumpur to Kualanamu with AirAsia was delayed because the inbound plane arriving late. The captain or first officer did not give any information before or during the flight with regards to flight information ie. welcoming address, flight status, time of arrival. The cabin crew were charming, but they were in quite a hurry as it was a short flight.",0
"Tokyo to Singapore via Taipei. Keeping in mind that this is a budget airline, everything about it is budget, but it was below my very low expectations - I feel for the staff who are just trying to do their job as directed by the company. First the positives - everything was hassle free, they are super on-time, no delays, 100% efficient at doing the important bits of getting you from A to B. But it stops there. Because we bought an upgrade after buying a meal for economy, we were not allowed to change our meal option from what we had paid extra for. Tip: it is best to buy a meal but do not choose anything otherwise you are stuck with it. The seats are uncomfortable and they are tilted forwards such that you are sliding off the seat the entire 10 hours of the flight. The foot rest doesn't do anything, and it only reclines six inches, both combined, you are still sitting completely upright. The seat belt sign is always on for some reason (even when there is no turbulence) and you are not allowed to use the bathroom half the duration of the flight (exaggeration). The food is not bad, but portion size is small. And finally the staff are not happy and they show it. It must be a horrible company to work for! If I had a choice I would choose a different airline but we needed a one way ticket and all airlines flying this leg charge a kidney and half a liver for a one way ticket!",0
I flew from Incheon to Taipei. The plane was on time and the service was fine for a low cost airline. I found the food and drinks to be rather expensive. $8 for a small can of beer! The worst thing about the flight was the old 777 plane. For some reason they revved up the left engine to full blast when the plane was parked and then throughout the flight that engine's rev level was continually and dramatically going up and down. Perhaps it was okay but it certainly didn't sound okay. It will be good when these old planes are replaced with the 787s.,0
Flights from Perth-KL then KL to Bangkok return. 4 flights 1 was fantastic. The rest were very disappointing. Even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets. We were subject to 'attitude' from staff when we complained about the chewing gum over our table dried vomit over the back of the seats in front of us and the accompanying smell. We were eventually moved. A toilet door broke because it wouldn't shut people sitting adjacent had to put up with the chemical smell. Our pre-ordered meals weren't served to us.,1
"Scoot seems cheaper, but with all the inconveniences and add ons, it is actually close to the price of a full service airline. If you pay for a meal, it is atrocious even by airline standards. Basic things like check in from the city of origin to destination if you need a transfer in SIN are not included - there is a fee (marketed as Scoot-Thru) if you do not want to go through customs. I took two trips with them (one Business  read premium economy) and one economy, and have had surprises on both. The latest was not being able to check in online from Hong Kong. Atrociously inconvenient and indicative of shoddy service. Definitely an airline to be avoided.",1
Constant delays as we have experienced yet again can only mean that either the maintenance being performed on these aircraft are substandard or the operational side of the airline is substandard. Four hours late arriving for a wedding in Denpasar Bali though part of this issue was not caused by Jetstar. And now we are sitting in the airport in Bali waiting to leave and a minimum five hour delay though they are telling us to prepare for a longer delay. No airline should be allowed to operate with these constant engineering and or mechanical delays.,1
"I bought a ticket for my sister to go to Butuan from Manila. They took my money and then after about an half hour later.... they sent an email that stated the credit card was declined as it did not follow safety protocols. so I called them to verify that it was a good transaction and gave my consent to use the card .. they refused to use the card even after verifying all the information to be true. They also refused to refund my money that they took, as well as request that my sister pays for the ticket at the airport in cash, so I told them, not until you refund my money,  they still refused. They wanted her to pay for the ticket a second time. They have very poor customer service  Here is there response VIA EMail. CEB Fraud Management Team 6:31 AM (59 minutes ago) to (ME) Dear (Deleted for safety reasons) We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced. Your card was not accepted by the system because it breached certain safety parameters in the screening tool used by our company in evaluating all card payment transactions. Your booking is still ""CONFIRMED"", but subject to payment of the amount due, either in cash or card, at any of our organic ticketing offices or at the airport upon check-in. Thanks, Your Cebu Pacific Team",1
"AirAsia flew me out of Kathmandu when my airline (China Southern Airlines) let me down. As simple as the booking is and you do get charged for everything etc. I cannot fault the 2 flights I took to KUL or MEL, the staff were friendly and efficient, seats were comfortable. Cheap and cheerful and remember your add ons when booking with AirAsia.",0
"I flew to Singapore from Sydney with Air Asia last week. I regret flying with AA. Pre-ordered meals were of very poor quality. There was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase - only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. The flight was freezing cold and I had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in ""hot"" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude. The flight attendants speak little English. They are careless. I think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as Qantas Economy.",1
"My flight 6e 1176 which was from Colombo to Chennai and then Chennai to Mumbai. My flight landed at Chennai on T3 and I made some alcohol purchases from the duty free which was expensive. My flight from Chennai to Mumbai was at T1, after doing the security check I was informed that I cannot take the alcohol bottles in my cabin luggage. The security personnel helped get the bag checked in but even after mentioning that there are fragile items in the bag, there was no care taken. When I reached my belt after landing I got nothing but broken bottles.",1
787 MEL-DPS late afternoon flight. Departed on time. Staff very friendly. Plane clean. Seats comfortable for the 5 to 6 hour flight. Plane smooth and quiet. Pre-ordered food tasty. Drink service a little slow. It is a plane load of Aussies going to Bali so demand was high. To be expected. Melbourne airport check in very easy with the new bag drop. Arrived a bit early. Overall all great.,0
Sydney to Melbourne. Terrible customer service. No heart. Act and carry on like youd expect from a budget airline. I wont be travelling with them again anytime soon. Qantas for me.,1
We booked 6 months ago Manila-Caticlan flights were not cheap. It took us 1 hour at check-in because ground staff were busy explaining to other passengers why they had to pay extra for luggage. Our first experience of an airline doing body weight check. On our return we got an SMS the night before that our flight was cancelled. Explanation was vague. Rebooked on their Kalibo flight at 7.40pm had to travel by van for another 1.5 hrs to Kalibo upon check-in told our flight was delayed to 10.45pm! It seems flight cancellations are a regular occurrence.,1
5/8/13 BKK-KUL FD2913 11/8/13 TGG-KUL AK6229. 12/8/13 KUL-Lombok AK1408. 24/8/13 DPS-BKK FD2977. I have recently flown several times on Air Asia. The planes have been immaculate the staff very helpful and they have an amazing turn around time and have always been on time. I was thoroughly impressed by the service and feel the budget airlines in Europe could learn a lot from them! We paid extra for a hot seat and were very comfortable with plenty of leg space. The price of this was cheap and I believe worth it. Baggage came through really quickly too. Only thing is no inflight entertainment at all but I was happy to use my iPad.,0
Bali to New Delhi via Kuala Lumpur.  No inflight entertainment and no free food given on flight. One has to pay. They defend that position by calling themselves a budget airline. Seats are uncomfortable. I'm  going to pay extra and travel with some other airline next time. The positives are that the staff is courteous and the flight is on time always. In fact they're before time.,1
The overall flight experience from Delhi to Visakhapatnam via Hyderabad was good compare to other airlines.The seats were comfortable and spacious. The food was nice but there was no In Flight entertainment.I suggest Indigo to Have InFlight entertainment.,0
I will never fly Jetstar again. Our seats tray tables and magazine section were filthy the magazine actually had chewing gum stuck to it the window was filthy. An hour leaving Perth and 1/2 an hour circling Bali. Yes I can wait 3.5 hours for food no issue at a 10.05am departure time. The flight home a 10.45pm departure from Denpasar: keep in mind that there is no food at the new airport (except chips sausages) when you've arrived the required 3 hours prior and then boarded a plane which will arrive Perth at 2am people need to eat. We were in row 10 by the time food arrived there was none left so they offered us a hot meal I don't mind paying but first you need to have food and secondly it needs to be edible. So I paid $35 for 2 meals we couldn't eat and 2 bottles of water.,1
"Terrible customer service. My flight was cancelled and the staff were totally rude, unhelpful and said there was nothing they could do and I had to do all the rebooking/refund process by myself. I asked them to help to find me another flight and they refused to provide any sort of assistance. Shame on you Jetstar.",1
CNX-MFM. Kiosk check-in with no bags. Took all of 10 seconds. Flight landed on-time in Macau. Flight left on-time but waited on the tarmac for 20 minutes before take-off with no explanation as to why. Cabin staff friendly and helpful. Would happily fly them again especially ex-CNX!,0
Jakarta to Denpasar. Due to take off 7 pm. Delay information at 6.30pm. No more info. Reason not clear. Got refreshment at 9.35pm. Read from TV monitor stated delayed 22.10. A very bad expererience. Bad communication service. Really disappointed.,1
"Jetstar Airways has the worst customer service. All of my dosmetic flights have caused me so many issues. I am currently stuck in the Queensland airport, delayed for over 2hrs because Melbourne is currently foggy. However, Tiger and Virgin are flying just fine to Melbourne. Even Jetstars earlier flight to Melbourne is currently boarding. Dont give such poor excuses and expect customers to be forgiving. Were not that stupid so believe this problems. Should be ashamed Jetstar.",1
Perth to KUL. My elderly mother paid extra to travel premium economy - what a waste! On both flights ground staff did not give priority boarding to premium economy passengers - everyone just barged on to the aircraft without a care for anyone else. Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight. No sign of any compensation nothing but a note in the email to say that we hope it won't inconvenience you in any way!,1
Singapore to Bali. Have taken many flights with Airasia which have been largely positive. My last experience I arrived late (20 minutes before departure) and was prepared to be refused to board the plane. I was surprised to have to pay 3X my original fare to buy a later flight.  I could have made my original flight had I been allowed to proceed without issue initially as I had no baggage to check in etc. Extremely disappointed.,1
DMK-SGN. First ever flight on the Air Asia group and I was greatly surprised. DMK is great with Air Asia international check in very easy. Plane was new clean and on-time. Crew were relaxed and friendly. The hot seat exit row is money well spent - did not bother with food on such a short leg. I would definitely recommend this airline and will readily use them again.,0
"Me and my family had booked a wonderful holiday from Sydney to Tokyo via Cairns. After going to Cairns, checking in and getting ready to go through customs we got a text message saying our flight was cancelled. The staff were very unhelpful and didnt care at all about my family and myself needs. After waiting hours long and negotiation we were squeezed onto a flight a few hours after our flight but not to Tokyo to Osaka. Once in Osaka we were told nothing at all and left to find our own way to where we needed to be. After about 30 minutes we find someone and they tell us we need to sleep in Osaka then they give us a Jetstar paper promising our flight the day after at 5:40pm. So the next day we need have to rearrange everything, our transfers, our tours, our accomodation, our shuttle bus. Then at 1:18 we came to the airport to check our flight to make sure we have everything sorted then they say our reservation for our flight wasnt booked, the staff werent helping us at all and said they cant help us so you need to go to Tokyo by yourself. This was appalling and really poor poor service. I would never recommend Jetstar because they dont give a care in the world.",1
"I was flying Melbourne to Gold Coast to join a friend so we can fly to Thailand the day after, and have flown by Jetstar many times, knowing that it is common practice to get some extra baggage and pay for it in advance, and did so this time as you can see.. As I was dropped to airport early had to wait to check my small luggage, 2 hours before, no problem so far. I am walking up and down and up again where you check in and one lady there maybe security, asked if I was ok? I explained that I am waiting to check my bag in, she convinced me that as I have paid for extra baggage I can do it immediately. So I did as to carry it on board, which by the way was not my proffered choice carrying bag with me. So this is where the problem begins I was told that I had to pay extra $60 dollars - obviously I was not happy tried to explain the situation to no avail, what really upset me here the two female staff were so rude never even wanting to listen. I wish someone in  Jetstar will understand this and review your standards and procedures. I flew back to Melbourne with another airline, and may never return to Jetstar, the way I feel now.",1
"I just happened to check the app a few days before leaving Honolulu to come home to Sydney and saw it changed to Hawaiian airlines. They had put us on Hawaiian and of course with that went my exit row, meal, 30kg baggage. Ended up in the back row of Hawaiian with limited recline next to a toilet (this is why I like an exit row so I can get out). Hawaiian was great though, crew and service was 10/10. No communication from Jetstar and because they changed us to Hawaiian all my baggage limit went from 30kg to 23 in line with the new airlines. Not Hawaiians fault but a shock since we had been shopping. Had to go on line to get a refund of the seats and meals we paid and Jetstar refused to give me a refund on the baggage which is odd since we paid for 30KG and got 23kg. I was just done with spending an hour on chat with them. Some people didn't get notified about the change in times so one lady we met spent from 5 am til 1250pm at airport waiting for Hawaiian. I wont touch them again. They are really a messy airline. On the way up in Business the crew were all over the place. They asked us what we wanted for dinner and breakfast, set our pre dinner drinks down then as I took my first sip they were putting dinner down. Talk about being in a rush. There is too much to go wrong with Jetstar at the moment they seem super unreliable",1
Delhi to Nagpur. All my experiences with this airline are very poor. Specially the courtesy of the staff is very poor. The legspace and the seats are very uncomfortable. One must choose to fly with this airline only when there is no alternative. The staff right at the check-in to even the customer care is so rude. The boast to fly on time but at what cost. They maintain the schedule at the cost of inconvenience of the guest. Onboard food is horrible. Overall one should prefer any other available alternative.,0
"My flight was canceled because of COVID. Because them canceling they have to offer the refund option. They try in so many ways to give a credit and they customer support is non-existent, they only have robot AVA that is instructed not let you talk to a real person. In the end I got a case number for a refund that would take 12+ weeks to process. Two weeks ago they tried again and sent an email with the cryptic message ""If we don't fail to hear from you within 14 days we will process a credit"" (whatever that ""if we don't fail"" means). I replied by email and of course no confirmation. I will never ever use Air Asia again.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. If there is an award for worse airline in the world, Jetstar has got to top the list. Ive never never taken any flights that cancels me flight 3 straight weeks in a row, and its a last minute cancel, 30 mins before departure. Yesterdays cancellation (6th dec 2019) is the last straw. We were all embarked on the plane, 5 minutes later we were asked to disembark and flight was cancelled. Jetstar is the most unreliable airline Ive taken.  For example yesterdays flight cancellation reason was due to Sydney airport curfew, but its because they delayed their own schedule that went into airport curfew time which is unacceptable! On top of that, no compensation arrangements at all! No accountability! And  lousy customer service. Look at the line to the support counter in the picture I attached.",1
"Wellington to Auckland. Have flown with them a few times, many of which have been delayed by hours for no good reason. Terrible airline with shocking customer service. I never look forward to flying with them and recommend you avoid using this airline.",1
"Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata. As usual on this run, a route I have flown close to 30 times in the past 6 years, an almost-flawless flight. The only problem being no arrival cards on board for non-Indian nationals thus needlessly spending a much longer time in queue at Kolkata immigration. Other than that, an impeccable flight, especially the superb cabin crew.",0
"Avoid at all costs. I booked flights to go from Singapore to Tokyo and due to unforeseen circumstances I have been really unwell and arent allowed to fly. I reached out to zipair and advised the situation and the medical advise I was given. I requested a voucher or refund and will fly with them again when i can. The operator advised I would be only receiving $50 (AUD) from a $550 (AUD) refund because HQ would give anything else (exact words) I was dumbfounded that that was the response. Not even with a medical certificate would they assist with situation. I am out of pocket $500 due to something I have no control over. I wish i could honestly fly with them, Its a planned holiday but I am physically unable. Really disappointing from an airline trying to build again",1
"Mumbai to Jaipur via Delhi with Indigo. Check in at Mumbai for drop off (for web check in) is longer than the regular check in line. Efficient check in staff. These flights were all on time and the cabin crew efficient. Aircraft was clean, neat and well maintained. Still the best airline in India.",0
My first flight with Scoot. I was very sceptical and worried due to many negative reviews I saw on the Internet. But good experience overall. The flight was comfortable and cabin crew helpful and smiling. The aircraft was changed from TR3 to 777-200 leased from Singapore Air but this was informed well in advance. The negatives were that flight was delayed on departure by 45 minutes and same to Hyderabad. Luckily there were no terminals to be changed and my connecting flight from Hyderabad was after 5 hours gap hence saved. Another thing missing was the inflight entertainment.,1
"This airline is a total rip-off for the extras. First airline that I have ever travelled with a restriction on the number of bags that can be attributed to a passenger for check-in. So that meant that even if I didn't hit the limit of 32kg extra baggage that I purchased out of my own pocket using 1 bag, the other bags cannot be checked in. Judging from the number of people who were also stuck at the check-in line, I know that this requirement is not clearly made known to passengers. Had to purchase for seat assignments. That itself was understandable since this is a budget airline. But the seat was not clearly indicated to be non reclining! Imagine 6hrs of sitting upright! Someone ought to be compassionate enough to indicate this to passengers just like what other airlines does.",1
"Bandung to Kuala Lumpur. The check in was fair, but I asked to pay the baggage fee - I didn't know that the ticket fare I bought online was not covering baggage. The airport boarding room in Bandung was not too big, some passengers were standing. The flight delayed for 30 minutes. The ground staff didn't arrange the queue according to the seat area, so people started to queque 30 minutes before call. I was not aware about pre meal order and decided not to order on board. The seat space was enough for me, maybe near emergency exit was wider. For low cost flight, I think I would recommend AirAsia.",0
"Booked Jetstar 3 times and flight cancelled 2 times! My flight was first being rescheduled to the later time of 4am. After checking, the flight was cancelled and I was only informed via SMS just 3 hours before departure. I was already on the way to airport and it was midnight. No more Jetstar.",1
"Kuala Namu to Kuala Lumpur. As usual, Air Asia always provide smooth experience without any hassle from check-in until departure. However, Airasia is now implemented a strict 7kg policy where cabin baggage has to be strictly only up to 7kg, or else it would be charge expensively.",0
"Sydney to Melbourne. I received a message 3 minutes before walking out the door to catch my late evening flight with Jetstar. ""Your flight from Sydney is cancelled. Go to website to check your flight options. We're sorry your flight has been cancelled."" Bit of a pathetic apology, but I jumped online immediately to investigate. This was due to bad weather - so not Jetstar's fault, but their responsibility to compensate none-the-less especially considering other airlines were still flying from Sydney, and I was paying for a promised service. My reason for booking a late flight was that I was working my part time job (ie.can't afford the higher fares for Qantas or Virgin) in the day and needed to fly from Sydney to Melbourne for a job interview. The interview was at 9am on Thursday, so the alternative afternoon flights they were offering on Thursday afternoon were not a solution. I was told that I could swap my flight for an afternoon flight on Thursday, or morning flight on the Friday. Or a voucher for the amount of the cancelled flight. I explained that my reason for travel was a job interview in the morning (not just leisure or an unimportant trip) and therefore an afternoon flight was pointless. I could not be flexible - not to mention my return flight to Sydney was scheduled for 3pm. Arrive in Melbourne at 1pm and return to Sydney at 3pm the same day?? I told them I had no need for a change of time and date unless that change landed me in Melbourne in time for my interview. I was given more options (and then fewer options) for Thursday afternoon or Friday, and not one that actually properly compensated me for this cancellation. A voucher provided in five business days was not a solution, and with no extra planes added the following day to compensate for the hundreds of passengers put out; I was left with no solutions, and out of pocket. Finally I agreed to their only form of refund (despite the assistant explicitly saying at one point Jetstar can refund cash depending on the reason...ie whether they deem it worthy). It was this point that I was offered the amount for the cancelled flight, only. They still tried to charge me the cost of the return flight despite cancelling my initial flight! The attempt to still charge me for the return flight, after an hour of nil solutions, was enough to firm my mind. Avoid Jetstar. They do not care about their customers. They are a budget airline because they take advantage of their customers to make a profit. I could only just afford the flight to an interview. Another reviewer summarised Jetstar well: This airline is highly unreliable carrier with an arrogant culture and devious selling practices.",1
I enjoyed my trip. Check in was no trouble. The staff were very friendly and the prepaid meal (ham and cheese toastie) was fine for a short flight. There was a slight delay (10 minutes) which was no big deal. The service was very efficient for a full flight.,0
"As most of the time good experience. Was traveling with only cabin baggage so no counter check in experience, boarding started on time and so as departure, even though it was raining heavily at Mumbai still departed on time. Due to weather it was little turbulent on the way and reached Ahmedabad on time. An hour long flight light snacks was provided. Cabin was clean and fresh, seats are ok.",0
"We flew on Jetstar from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur, transiting in Singapore on 22 May 2022. The flight was supposed to depart at 12.00 pm. Boarding was on time but we waited on the plane until 1.30 pm. No announcement was made on the reason for the delay and the arrangement for transit passengers if they miss their connecting flight. We expressed our concern to a flight attendant that we may miss our connecting flight to Kuala Lumpur. Even if we could make it for the connecting flight, we are unsure whether our luggage can be transfered to the next flight. We were assured that we will make it to our connecting flight and our luggage will be transferred to the connecting flight. Our connecting flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was supposed to depart at 7.30 pm Singapore time. By the time we arrived in Singapore, boarding for the connecting flight has commenced. There was no staff at the arrival gate to direct us to the departure gate. We and some other transit passengers rushed to the wrong end of the terminal and had to run back to the correct gate. When we arrived at Kuala Lumpur, we waited in vain for our luggage for more than an hour. There was a whole group of passengers from Melbourne who were in the same situation. Again there was no staff at the baggage area for us to ask. Eventually some passengers managed to contact the staff to report our lost luggage. They told us that our luggage were still in Singapore and they may arrive the next day. By the time we completed the report, it was close to 11 pm. We stayed the night at the Kuala Lumpur airport hotel hoping that we can pick up the luggage the next day instead of having the luggage delivered to us since we have chocolate which may melt in the heat. We picked up our luggage at 2.30 pm from the airport before travelling to our destination. The flight was a most unpleasant and tiring experience for my wife and me. There was very poor communication and we were left to fend for ourselves although the problem was no fault of ours.",1
Ranchi to Kolkata. They only serve food to passengers that have done the required preibooking of meals and that's it. In a short flight like this Indigo cabin crew will sell food and water apart from pre booked passengers.  This is my last time.,1
"Krabi to Bangkok. I'm 6' (1.8 meters) tall and my knees were touching the back of the seat. Absolutely no leg room. The only reason we took AirAsia is because we wanted to arrive at Don Meuang Airport. AirAsia prices are almost never as good as they sound. By the time one adds luggage fees, choosing a seat fee, credit card fee and other fees, the prices generally are not much cheaper than other airlines.",1
"Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. We feel like the airline has been very unfair to us and so will not be looking to fly with them again. The main reason is that we were charged extortionate prices for luggage check in despite having no other option. We could not add luggage on their website, and even if we could, they would not only accept Indonesian cards for payment so we had to use an alternative booking site which gave us no option to add luggage in advance. Then when we turn up and we were charged outrageous prices, more than I've ever paid before. We complained to absolutely no sympathy. Very unhappy with the experience. Will not be looking to fly again with Lion Air.",1
"Singapore to Jakarta. My flight to Jakarta was delayed, AirAsia sent me an email saying that i have an option to get a refund. And when I follow the steps as stated in the email to request for refund from their website, there's no refund option. There's no email address either. There's only a livebot, which is useless as it only has standard answers. I wrote a complain and they only say they will send to relevant department to handle. I am now waiting for their follow up.",1
"Kochi to Hyderabad via Mumbai. I earlier travelled to cochin, it was delayed by 1.3 hours. This time they directly rescheduled my travel. I was supposed to travel from Cochin to Hyderabad via Chennai. But they had rerouted me to Mumbai then to Hyderabad. Before rescheduling directly they should have given me options of cancellation or showing next available flight options. I got delayed by more than 5 hours. Who would want to suffer without sleep for purely airlines mistake?  When i ask for compensation they  say you should have called before starting your travel.",1
"Went on an overnight flight from Osaka to Don Mueang Bangkok. The staff were lovely. One flight attendant in particular was very cheerful and made everyone laugh (and even applaud) as he sang in Thai over the intercom. Flight attendants are usually a little robotic so it was nice that the whole team seemed to be having fun on this one. I have found AirAsia flights to be very cold, so bring some layers!",0
"Worst flight ever. Flight was cancelled due to bad weather, the day was so clear nice and sunny. I was given two options either to rebook flight 2 days later where I have to pay my accommodation in expensive city like Sydney for 2 nights or refund. I had to pay $500 (Where I paid $100 to book this flight) to rebook another flight next day and they offered me voucher than cash refund.",1
"We flew FD2603 DMK-CSX on 16/09/14 and returned by FD FD2604 on 19/03/14. The DMK-CSX boarding was delayed because staff were not at the gate at departure time. We were informed that they had been busy with another gate and thus no staff were available for our gate. The boarding thus became messy although we managed to get through because of our priority boarding seat privilege. On the return flight our group consisted of 13 persons with 4 booking codes. We were told to check-in as a group and we were the first group to check in at the counter. Our queue however was overtaken by another tour group. We had to ""protest"" in order to have our queue maintained. Check-in was slow and rather inefficient and we were informed that it is because the staff are new. BTW the inflight services are OK on both legs. Web-ordered meals were reasonable. Finally when we arrived at DMK three of our luggage had lost the luggage tags. Fortunately there was not much baggage and we could identify them. But imagine if this were a connecting flight or several pieces of baggage was involved?",0
"There is a surcharge if your carry-on exceeds 7 kilos, which is just over 15 pounds. Of course, once you pay the surcharge, the airline puts zero consideration into where your carry-on goes, because the surcharge has nothing to do with extra weight, and everything to do with bleeding you for more money. This airline represents everything that is wrong with air travel.",1
"I booked one month prior a Melbourne to Bangkok business class flight for 16th April. All was going well until I got to my allocated aisle seat (2F) only to be told it had been changed to 3E a middle seat last row squashed in between two large people. I refused to sit in it as it was not the seat I had paid for. A ground staff member came on board and said they had the right to change seats based upon handicapped or disabled people. He said I should have read their terms and conditions (wtf?) & I wonder how many Jetstar staff have actually read them? I said I wanted to get off and he said ok, give me your ticket and I'll get your bags even if it meant holding up the flight for 1hr? He then found a seat for me front row bulkhead in the middle which reluctantly accepted due to a business meeting I had next morning overseas. There were two free seats I could have had but they were reserved for the poor flight crew who had a long 8.5hr afternoon flight to endure. I later discovered some Jetstar staff had asked checkin passengers if anyone wanted to upgrade to business class for $300.",1
"Long time flyer with Jetstar. I  have had many delays and cancelled flights. Recently booked trip on my club Jetstar account for 9 passengers, more recent been diagnosed with cancer. Opened chat with Jetstar within in 30 minutes had my flight refunded into vouchers with Jetstar. They were so good, this airline will work for you. Very impressed.",0
"Sydney to Auckland. No online checkin for our flight. My wife and I have been traveling internationally for a week. We are departing Sydney to New Zealand and the ticket agent tells us we have no baggage allowance and we will have to pay $350+ for one checked bag (15 kilos) plus excess for carry on bags. My wife and I spend 40+ minutes frantically spreading things around, wearing a couple of layers of clothes and throwing away gifts for our kids. We then go to another person to pay or excess fees and are told we dont have to pay it and our ticket includes one bag for each passenger at 23 kilos each. By this time our checked bag is gone so we cant add anything back in, my wife is in tears and Im mad as heck. We have no recourse as we are heading back to the US. The only thing the ticket agents offered was a food voucher. Not even an upgrade to an exit row seat for gosh sakes! Im highly disappointed and unfortunately this airline has ruined what had to this point been a great visit to Australia. This airline is worse than Spirit Airlines in the US.",1
"Honolulu to Sydney with Jetstar Airways, Our carry on size baggage exceeded the airline 7 kg limit, so we were forced to check it and pay $160 per bag, an extraordinary high fee. Then one of the bags was damaged on the flight and they refused to refund the fee, and are asking us to jump through various hoops to get reimbursed. On the return trip, they failed to bring my walker up to the aircraft for me to disembark with. Baggage was damaged a second time. The staff seemed exceedingly poorly trained and indifferent to customers. Quite a frustrating experience.",1
"Scheduled on flight from Singapore to Bali 8/12/19 at 5.20am. The flight was cancelled at 7pm (10 hours before departure time). We had already done online check in by then and did not realise the flight was cancelled till 2am. The next available flight proposed was 24 hours away on 9/12/19. As we had already made travel plans and tours in Bali, we decided to cancel the booking and were refunded the cost of the flight. However, there was no additional compensation by Jetstar or apology. The new flight booked was three times the cost of the original flight as this was a last minute booking. This is the second time Jetstar has suddenly cancelled a flight. My first experience was from Hobart to Singapore. Will not travel with Jetstar again.",1
Absolutely the worst customer service. Can't ever talk to a real person. Tried to cancel due to a medical issue with relative. Did not want a refund but merely a credit towards a future flight when illness over but refused through their automated chat. Again no live person capabilities. The worst airline service experience ever. I would never do business with them again. I'll pay more elsewhere. Beware!,1
"Flew Scoot from Singapore to Osaka on a B787. For a budget airline, it was good value. Check in online was easy. Seat width is similar to other full service carrier and are better padded than some. Didnt order the food or drinks, I eat before boarding the aircraft and fill up my own water bottle. Brought a book to read. Crew were friendly. Cant really complain for the price I paid for.",0
Melbourne-Hobart-Sydney. Average service on all flights but very poor ground staff service in Hobart. Staff were very unhelpful and rude. Flight delayed for two hours from Hobart with no prior notifications. Surprised how this is the best LCC in Australia.,1
Terrible airline. The outbound flight is delayed 3 hours. For the return flight they rescheduled it really early in the morning. We got to the airport then we had a msg that it has been put back to the original time. Missed out on my  hotel breakfast to waste 4 additional hours sitting round at the filthy airport.,1
DEL-COK-DEL. Excellent flight both flights on time as we had pre-booked meals and seats check-in was a breeze. Overall highly recommended as a premium low cost carrier.,0
"The seats on the plane were uncomfortable. No entertainment. No free water or drinks or snacks, everything has to be purchased prior to take off or during flight for snacks and drinks. There was no AC that I could feel hot and uncomfortable. Staff members pick and choose to tell people to put your seatbelt on but will bypass some, maybe they feel uncomfortable to ask. It took a long time to check in. I will be picking another airline next time.",1
Flew Jetstar JQ960 from Adelaide to Cairns on February 3. For a (by Australian standards) lengthy domestic flight it was well worth the saving to fly Jetstar. Incredibly attentive crew comfortable seats and iPads available to hire along with the usual food and drink for purchase.,0
"Thiruvananthapuram to Colombo. Due to the cornavirus and the closing of India's borders, I was forced to cancel my IndiGo flight to India. The refund by Indigo - free of charge - was very easy online and very accurate and efficient. I have travelled on this airline before, it is a very good company and today I verify that they are excellent on all levels.",0
"Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore. Currently sitting at Changi  with practically zero information on our overnight flight that was due to depart at midnight. We were advised very late of a 6 hour delay, flight not scheduled to depart until 0600. Surely the airline knew about such a significant delay before now. My Scoot flight was also delayed coming over here from Sydney for 2 hours, seems standard for their service so keep in mind there is a good chance you will get stuffed around if you fly with this airline. Knowing the absolute barebones approach, shoddy customer service and what it seems consistent delays, this will likely be my last flight with Scoot. I would be careful booking with such an inconsistent service if at all, best avoid in fact, pay the extra $50 and fly with an airline who is organised and punctual.",1
"I have been flying Scoot air to Penang and Bangkok since Covid subsided. Overall, the travel experiences have not been satisfactory. Recently, we paid for extra leg room seats 4D and 4C when the tickets were purchased online. When we checked in physically at the counter, the boarding pass were issued accordingly. However, after boarding the flight to Bangkok minutes just before the plane took off, the airline staff requested us to vacate the seats and move to the back row seats as though they did not know we had paid for front extra leg room seas (I shown them the receipts and boarding pass). Despite having secured 2 extra leg room seats as indicated in the boarding pass. Different staff appeared and indicated that the plane has been changed last minute and the current seats belonged to Scootplus and we must move to row 31 and 32. She took our boarding pass and use pen to amend the boarding pass seat number. We paid additional additional fare of SGD 190 for 2 to remain in Scootplus and requested for the refund of SGD 54 for extra leg rooms seats (2). After 2 weeks, still no news although the hotline said they would investigate and revert. The experience was certainly not something we cherished. It was ok to change plane due to unforeseen circumstances but refund should be made for overpayment. For any underpayment, we were happy to top up as well. Earlier experience to Penang also did not end well as date change of ticket online in the portal were not very smooth, very hard to make date change during May - June 2022 (the price differentials for flight/date change were much higher than buying a new ticket). Eventually, I just bought another tickets for the whole family instead of making travelling date changes.",1
I booked a flight from Bali to Melbourne with a stopover at Darwin. The return flight was delayed by 3 hours thus I would miss my connecting flight in Darwin. At the airport they refused to tell me what replacement flight would be available. They gave me a number to call which was invalid. Had to call the Australian customer service and they kept insisting that I somehow get through immigration in 15 minutes to catch the connecting flight and they couldn't give me a replacement or to talk to the staff at the airport (there is no Jetstar staff at Bali airport just some other company staff that issues the boarding passes). After all the trouble they put me on a flight to Sydney which would connect to Melbourne but I had to spend 9 hours at Bali airport and miss work. If anyone wants to get anywhere on time and without any hassle then definitely avoid Jetstar.,1
"Our initial flight which was supposed to be a direct flight from Mumbai to Kolkata was cancelled and so as an alternative the airline offered various alternatives, one of which was via HYD which we took. The airline claimed that the flight was cancelled due to Covid restrictions but is clear that the flight was cancelled due to lack of good loads and so instead of the usual travel time of 2.5 hours the total flight duration was almost 6 hours which could have been better. At least during the online check-in the airline didn't charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief. Both the flight segments themselves were quite okay and departed well on time even though some of the conduct of the passengers was questionable like not wearing the face shield / hazmat suit for the middle row seats even despite the crew reminding the passengers to wear it numerous times. Nowadays when flying low cost carriers, it seems like a bus journey with wings where the airlines try to get as many passengers stuffed inside the aircraft as much as possible. If you are a passenger who likes to travel in a bit of exclusivity and luxury without feeling claustrophobic about the number of people surrounding you, you are better off travelling on other airlines. But if however, you prefer getting from point A to point B with slightly cheaper fares, then IndiGo does the job very well.",0
"Penang to Singapore. I was literally screamed at by a cabin attendant when I wanted to take a general cabin view picture during boarding (I grudgingly complied). With other airlines it's an ok thing so long as you don't take pictures of cabin crew, which is the regulation in Europe. But why do they have to be so rude towards someone who just wants to document his flight experience? My flight departed Penang late which resulted in a late arrival in Singapore. No Scoot WiFi on these planes. Probably the only plus point was the ground staff in Penang who were polite. So although the seat pitch and comfort was acceptable on this flight and the price was amazing, the service was under par.",1
"Brisbane to Melbourne. This was my first fight with Jetstar and had no previous expectations of the airline. We had quite a bit of luggage as we were moving from Canada to Australia and had everything that we came over with, so we had to purchase extra luggage. Although we had to pay the extra surcharge for 30 kg's of checked luggage each the price was very reasonable (Considering a similar flight in Canada would probably be double the cost). Prior to boarding I saw another Jetstar flight weighing carryon baggage to make sure that everyones carryon baggage met the standard of 7kg. I was a little worried because although we only had a backpack each, 7kgs is not a lot of weight. However, when it was time for our flight to board we did not have to weigh our carry on bags. I am not sure why we got the pass on the scale and the other flight had to weigh their bags. The flight itself took off on time and had the seatbelt sign off within a few minutes. We were in Seats 20 E & F, however as there was a kid kicking the back of my seat I moved as there was free seats in row 20 ABC. The leg room was probably the worst pitch I have ever sat in, coming in at 29 inches. I am 188cm (6' 2"") tall, so this was uncomfortable for me however anyone smaller would be okay for the short flight. The staff came around just after take off to do a service. Standard stuff was available for purchase (hot/cold drinks, sandwiches, snacks), but there was no complementary drinks or snacks. There was a family sitting in the 2 rows behind us that had 5 small kids that were making a lot of noise and not following the seatbelt sign. At one point the staff acted very professionally and asked the parents to get the kids back in their seats for landing. We landed on time and exited the plane on the tarmac, but were walking distance to the terminal so we didn't need a bus. Overall an average flight for the price we paid, I probably would not recommend as the legroom was uncomfortable and there were a lot of families and children that made the flight seem chaotic at times. The price was okay though, and as long as you know what you were getting into with a low cost airline it is an okay way to get around Australia for a reasonable price.",0
"Jakarta to Denpasar, my first time flying an A330 with Lion Air. Leg room was huge compared to the 737. The ground staff is okay (at CGK and DPS), cabin crew is nice and friendly, but the baggage claim took longer than I was expecting. Other than that, it was the cheapest flight and it is worth it. No IFE, only magazine. They sell drinks but not sure if they sell food on this flight. Seat width is smaller than the one in 737. Plane was configured in a 3-3-3 layout and it was quite new, and also clean.",0
"Jetstar pushed flight back 6.5 hours with less than 24 hours notice (informed at 6.30pm) with the first flight leaving at 6am from Avalon, giving no options for getting back to Avalon. A drink offered as compensation, even though I had to buy dinner at airport, not to mention cancelling evening plans. Giving adequate warning to change plans would have been fine, offering to compensate adequately would have made me potentially consider using them again.",1
MEL-DPS DPS-MEL. Good business class fare. Had an equipment swap MEL-DPS to an A330 which was a little disappointing but still comfy for the 6 hour flight. IPAD entertainment is annoying but we were 1A and !B and used the bassinet to mount them on not much selection in way of movies. Staff really efficient and friendly food excellent massive improvement Jetstar. DPS-MEL B787 really nice plane staff and service just as good 2 hour delay due to late arrival from MEL. Will definitely fly again for the right price and schedule. If they only improved the on time performance.,0
"Singapore to Penang. Almost non-existent customer service. Had a delay of nearly 12 hours for my flight from Melbourne to Singapore. All I received was an email sent the night before informing us of the delay for our morning flight the next day. Reason given in email for the delay was due to ""operational constraint"" which was rejected by my insurance. I understand from the cabin crew that the delay is due to technical issues but customer service staff refuses to provide a proper report hence I am unable to claim my insurance for the delay. Got a $50 voucher from Scoot for the delay, used it to book another scoot flight and was charged an additional mystery charge. Called and found out it was wrongly charged yet they refused to refund. When pushed further, the service staff insist that I upgrade my seat and use the amount to offset the difference and make additional payment on the balance. Mistake on their side but customer to bear the costs?",1
"I flew AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to Senai Airport, Johor Bahru. The cabin was awfully dirty. Somebody spilt rice all over the floor of Row 10, but it wasn't cleaned up at all. My friend who sat on Seat 10F opened his meal tray and absentmindedly put his phone on it, only to find that AirAsia hadn't bothered to wipe the tray either. Although AirAsia is a budget airline, and this was a domestic flight, I still think that this is not acceptable.",1
"I bought the Jetstar Airways ticket for this flight from Jakarta to Singapore last minute because I missed Scoot flight because of traffic at Jakarta Int'l airport. The ground staff was nice but boarding was chaotic. The flight itself was ok, adequate service from FAs. The flight arrived on time.",0
"Dumaguete to Manila. The promo fare is already a big reason to be happy flying with Cebu Pacific as they give people opportunity to travel and visit beautiful destinations in the country. The flight was delayed for 45 minutes, not a big deal for me. Ground crew and cabin crew were friendly. As for the flight experience, there was nothing very special but I was not expecting much. Seat was comfortable. No reason for me to give them low rating. I am just simply satisfied. Keep it up.",0
"We just got back from 4 weeks away in Asia. We took Scoot to Singapore for around $AUD200 (each) including 15kg each and a meal. There is nothing flash about this airline but the room between rows was acceptable! The staff were efficient and the food was OK. We bought ""FlyBagEat"" however you have to add on the cost of a seat to this fare how are you going to fly without a seat? The ""convenience fee"" of a $10 was added (apparently for credit card)! All in all we had no complaints about the trip over. We also booked a trip back but as this leaves at 2.10am we decided to buy a super seat for about an extra $40 each. This turned out to be worth every cent - we booked a seat in aisle 21 just behind business class and had the bulkhead in front. My husband could stretch his legs and we didn't have anyone in front so didn't have to worry about anyone wanting to recline their seat. On the way back we arrived at 5pm at Changi with luggage for a flight leaving at 2am. It cost us $5 each for the early check-in and you have to pay in cash. One good value deal was access to the SATS lounge for $S39 each. This allows you to use the lounge for 4 hours (consecutive use). This was a wonderful oasis for us. Also you get priority boarding which is a real asset at 2am in the morning! I thought the breakfast was revolting (fried mushrooms a sausage of sorts a triangle of some egg dish (omelette perhaps) and a soggy hash brown. You have to remember these dishes have been kept warm for the last 6 hours or so. One redeeming feature was some fresh fruit and a drink of orange juice. We would definitely fly Scoot again especially now we know some of the lurks!",0
Cebu - Manila: My online reservation could not be accessed by staff at the airport. I was offered to take the same flight at almost three times the price I would have paid if my booking had registered correctly! The print-out of my e-ticket was considered irrelevant. Shaking heads and shrugging shoulders were the reactions I got from Cebu Pacific staff. I decided to use another airline. Despite some okay experiences with Cebu Pacific on previous occasions I will never use it again.,1
"AirAsia exceeded my expectations on this trip. Both flights were on-time. Boarding was fast and efficient. The aircraft was clean, modern and well-appointed. The flight crew were friendly with attractive uniforms. I had a reserved seat and had pre-booked a meal when I purchased my ticket, which was served to me at my seat. My connecting flight was easy to transfer to and there were no delays. This was my first experience with AirAsia and I will certainly use them again on my next trip to S.E. Asia.",0
"This airline is ridiculous. This is something I haven't seen before. I bought tickets for 8 people to Manila to Dubai and they didn't let them embark for some absurd reasons. First they said they did not have connection from the same airport, as a rule I bought another 8 tickets from the same airport in Dubai and then they said they have to pay extra for luggage that I have already paid online once. and last time they said they were too late and would not let them embark. My question is: how does a plane leave without 8 people? And if so, then reschedule the tickets for another date. There is no such thing as not giving back money or changing tickets.",1
"I booked return flights Bandung - Singapore on 5th September 2022. I subsequently received an email from AirAsia on 15 October telling me that my flights were cancelled due to 'Operational reasons'. A promise is made for the refund to be made in 30 days. Now more than a month later, the refund is still in progress and no further advisories to enlighten me the status .... except from what I see in my account on their website. AirAsia has no customer service, no customer service phone number, not even an email address. All they have is an online chatbot named AVA, which is worse than useless. So you are on your own should any problems arise after you confirm your booking. Will definitely avoid flying AirAsia if I had a choice.",1
"Melbourne to Townsville. Hearing some bad reviews about cancellations and delays with Jetstar I was really worried about our flight. We had to check ourselves in via a kiosk and tag our own luggage and send it on its way. Having waited in an extremely long line before this innovation, it was actually a positive thing. We boarded efficiently, although by steps - and left right on time. The seat itself had reasonable leg room but was very narrow. We were lucky we had a free seat between us. The price seems initially cheap but when you add in things like seat choice, checked bag, any food it adds up to almost the price of a full service airline however, Jetstar is the only airline that flies direct from Melbourne to Townsville. We were not able to download any entertainment from their website as they don't allow this on this three hour flight. Made for a boring three hours, fortunately we had books to read. The flight attendants were very friendly, more so than any flight we have ever been on domestically or internationally - go figure. We had pre-ordered a Pho and ham and cheese toastie - mistake. They were not nice at all. I wish we hadn't done that. Anyway we arrived in Townsville 10 minutes early so that was a bonus. I would definitely choose this airline as it saves a lot of time when you can fly direct.",0
Auckland-Singapore return: I was a little apprehensive about flying with Jetstar due to poor reputation in NZ. I needn't have worried. Smooth and hassle-free check-in (both ways) very friendly check-in staff (both ways) positive and hard-working cabin crew (both ways) food and IPad perfectly adequate both flights pretty much on schedule seat absolutely fine for the length of journey (10 hours). A good return trip all round. For the ticket price paid this product represented exceptionally good value.,0
"I thought I've seen the worst but this is even worse, the worst airline experience I've ever had. No food or on board entertainment whwatsoever during the long fllights to and from my transit in New Delhi from Singapore with Istanbul as final destination. I'm fine with that but the on ground experience has been terrible. At the gate I was told to go to desk for document check and asked to show visa to my final destination which is after Istanbul and has NOTHING to do with my flight with Indigo. And worst of all I lost my checked in luggage once I arrived in Istanbul. That has never happened in all my 25 years of frequent travel. All of those reviews you've seen about lost luggage & bad customer service with Indigo are completely true. Their cheap fare is not worth it. I regretted not checking Indigo's reviews before taking this airline for the first time on this flight. Looking back I would rather just pay more than taking the bait of cheap fare from Indigo. Avoid it.",1
FD 2976/2977 Bangkok -Denpasar return. A very disappointing experience. Checked in online and only had to drop our bag spent over an hour at the counter waiting for staff to reconcile their problem. Good that they are using Don Muang Airport otherwise the long immigration line would worsen the experience unorganized boarding and people in hot seats ended up among the last to board. Things get slightly better on the aircraft. Emergency exit  hot seat pretty comfortable with no other passengers next to me and I end up taking all 3 seats for myself. Pre- ordered breakfast (Pancake) is delicious great punctuality. Other than that things are pretty horrible and chaotic. Pre-ordered food on the return flight inedible rice stale meat overcooked and obviously is re-heated more than once. Drinks sold on board are lukewarm Flight attendants try to be overly friendly. Hot seat when the plane is full became unbearable for such long flight. Will avoid in the future.,1
"I was travelling by myself for the first time so was having mixed feelings. After I boarded the flight I realised that I couldn't find my OCI card. I started to panic. But one of the crew member was so helpful and he introduced me to a ground staff. He was very friendly and professional and walked with me to the gates, where I was waiting. I was feeling so embarrassed and upset thinking that I would have to cancel the flight. But he was able to comfort me and asked me to check again inside my bag. Then I was able to find it on the floor next to my seat on the flight. I received a very good customer service and really appreciate their patience and the ground floor staff was with me throughout the time trying to assist in every possible way. I am very thankful and the staff definitely need to be acknowledged for their excellent customer service. Also the toilet cleanliness and seating comfort are commendable.",0
Jetstar Airways offered by far the best rate on this route so I decided to fly with them from Wellington to Christchurch. They succeeded to make the trip in under 40 minutes which is impressive. The ground staff were very friendly and did make everything for the passengers to board as quick as possible and the same happened at disembarking. I would say very efficient. Seat comfort was like with any other low-cost airline so nothing special here. I would recommend them and fly with them again on a short distance.,0
6E 062. Service has deteriorated. On-time urgency once seen is no longer seen. Online seat booking charges for all aisle and window seats. You can only get middle seats for free. Too money minded.,1
"Brisbane to Melbourne. After having previously tried to ensure that my baggage met the requirements and was within the size allowed for carry on luggage, I proceed straight through check-in not believing my carry on to be problematic. However, at the gate the airline staff weigh your baggage to ensure you meet the 7 kg weight requirement. I would understand this policy for excessively sized pieces, however, my bag came in at 8 kg and as a result of this occurring at the gate was forced to pay $60 for this bag that was 1 kg over the weight limit. This is clearly a penny-pinching method. Had the fee been appropriate for the additional weight carried I'd have had no problem. However, by this point I'd paid just as much as a Virgin or Qantas flight where this sort of penny-pinching isn't experienced. I don't recommend this airline as they clearly don't care about customer experience or service. In future I'd rather fly Tiger airways than Jetstar.",1
"I was going with Lion Air on 17th April 2020. As usual, fast check in and punctual both departures and arrival.  Got a window seat on a 737-800 at 15F. The flight went smoothly and it was my first flight with Lion air having a flight entertainment. It uses air-Fi but still in a limited service for playing games and watching film only and couldn't browse from search engine like chrome. I wished they improve more so we can operate your internet browser and social media when in flight. The flight took me on time at arrival airport. Good airline for a budget flyer.",0
"Flew with Jetstar from Sydney to Hobart return over the new year. The flight was much more expensive than normal, but that is to be expected during busy/peak travelling periods. Both routes were flown on the A320. The seats were fine, felt a little squashy at times but it was only a 1 hour 30 min flights. Cabin crew promptly came around with drinks and snacks, but I had brought my own food. No entertainment, but it's such a short flight it hardly matters. The incoming flight for our trip back to Hobart arrived late, but as soon as everyone was off the plane we boarded, which meant that the plane departed on schedule and arrived on time in Sydney. I've flown with Jetstar multiple times and have never had any issues with them. I will continue to fly with them.",0
I want to credit my flight or at least 'move flight' because of Covid 19 & I have followed each step carefully and correctly. I have spent hours on this only to discover I am charged the full amount. I was promised by email not to be charged any more as I purchased the ticket Jan 2020. It is completely opposite to what the email says.,0
Flew from Cochin to KL to Incheon. If you are taller than 180cm there will be not be enough room for your legs. They will push up against the seat in front and you will constantly get bumped if you're sitting in the aisle. Having to wait at LCCT is an awful experience. The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced. While boarding the crew insist on blasting cheesy rock music regardless of the time. The vegetarian food is over- priced for the small serving I received. The amount of money saved is minimal after adding up all of the extra costs.,1
"Bangkok to Jaipur. It becomes painful when you travel with your family, don't travel with small kids as this flight has no space for your legs. Very bad experience, my little kid and wife had a bad time for over four hours in this flight.",1
Dehli-Kathmandu-Dehli. Unfriendly staff they ask you to be at the airport 4 hours before departure for international flights and 2 hours for domestic flights. Arrived 3.5 hours early as anticipated no check-in counter was open. Nevertheless the plane seemed to be quite new and comfortable.,1
Denpasar to Jakarta with Lion Air. Filthy aircraft cabin and ill groomed crew. Quite a contrast to my flight with other Indonesian budget airlines. Absolutely no service free not even a cup of water. Ground staff friendly and efficient but cabin crew can do lot more as passengers will compare them with competition available. No airshow to track the flight and announcements not very clear. Way below standards of competitor airlines.,1
"I didn't fly. I booked and tried to cancel the next day when my partner found out she couldn't travel. This was in 4 months time. When I eventually was able to contact Jetstar and only after they sent me a booking number, I was told I couldn't cancel with out losing my points, couldn't get a credit and if I chose to change dates, it would cost me $240 for a $500 flight. This is not customer service, this a extortion.",1
On 2nd March I travelled with a group of 9 ladies from Kozhikide to Mumbai. We were so well looked after by the customer relations especially Aswathi. The ground staff was exceptionally helpful and kind. The flight was on time and it was a very pleasant experience to fly with Indigo.,0
"Legazpi to Manila. I was surprised by how the generous legroom of this aircraft. Initially I thought seats are cramped as it is a small plane but I was wrong, though the flight took a little longer by 20 minutes which is fine by me. Flight was on time & crew, as usual, were amazing. Treated to a beautiful evening sky. Good job Cebu Pacific.",0
We flew last week and upgraded to the premium seats with additional legroom. The seats were immediately behind business class with lots of legroom - in front of the wing and therefore quieter. The seats were quite comfortable. The plane had arrived 20 mins late and left 30 mins late - about 15 mins was made up on the flight. The return flight left on time and arrived early. Food was not very exciting airline fare. A welcome change from the usual much more expensive flights.,0
MUM-DEL. Excellent service - paid Rs300 for the front row which if you're my size is worth it! Inflight food is on a pay basis nothing special but it's good size portions and not bonkers expensive. Great inflight crew cheerful and engaging brand new planes. My first choice now for domestic Indian flights.,0
Perth to Melbourne. The flights we had with Jetstar were perfectly fine. The amount they charge you for overweight luggage is spelt out very clearly. So I would suggest to people they read what they are purchasing first.,0
"Very bad experience overall! We were supposed to fly in the morning with Jetstar Airways from Auckland to Christchurch and our flight got canceled at the last minute when all passengers were at the gate. Then started the hassle of putting all passengers back on later flights. Lots of lines and time lost for finally being rebooked at 4pm, miss our campervan location in Christchurch and lose a complete day of our honeymoon. Very fun to spend 6 hours in Auckland airport by the way. The Jetstar staff was not friendly and never apologized about the situation. Just a very bad experience throughout the day!",1
Excellent flight. Almost empty flight. Had the entire row for both me and my partner. Should've saved money and not pay for seat assignment. Did have to pay for extra luggage but that was expected. No food ordered. Only hot food option on menu was a I think ravioli. Didn't matter as we had prepared food to eat on the plane. Ground crew was friendly and efficient. Flight crew was overworking unnecessarily by checking the overhead compartment every 30 minutes.,0
"Perth to Hong Kong via Singapore. I made a online booking for my son and myself. Although I was on the Scoot Website, I booked Scoot on the Perth - Singapore sectors but the Singapore - Hong Kong sectors were with Tiger Airlines. I paid for food on the Perth to Singapore sector and the Singapore to Perth sector. As well as seat allocation, so I could sit next to my son. I also paid for extra legroom (it was 79 AUD for each seat allocation with legroom on the Perth - Singapore return sectors. When we boarded in Perth, we were allocated our seats, but advised that we didn't order any food. As I didn't print out a hard copy of my reservation, I had no leg to stand on, and as had no wifi could not retrieve my booking. When I got to Singapore, they advised, that I had cancelled the meals (even thought I had been charged for them.) I ended up paying again for meals on board with cash. Was annoyed when I got to Singapore that we were flying Tiger, I thought we were flying Scoot. Before we returned I rang Scoot (was on hold and on the telephone call for just shy of 2 hours) to try and reinstate my meals. Scoot advised that I could not get a refund for the food not used on the first sector and now they could not guarantee any food on the return sector as was inside 72 hours. (I thought issue was resolved in Singapore on the way up), I was actually ringing to see why a seat hadn't been allocated out of Hong Kong for me as I had paid for it. I was advised that I had not paid for a seat. When we got to Singapore and was issued with boarding cards for the Singapore - Perth sector our seats were not where we had paid to sit. When I queried this, I was advised that ""we are just ground staff, we cannot do anything, and you will need to put it in writing"". I did this when I returned to Perth. Only to be advised by Scoot by email 2 weeks later that they were ""sorry for the inconvenience"" would give me a voucher for the value of 50 Singapore dollars (even thought on face value I paid $82 Singapore Dollars for each seat), and nothing was mention of the food that was not provided ($36.00). In total I spend $192.00 Australian Dollars for services I didn't receive. I will not be travelling on Scoot again.",1
"Newcastle to Melbourne. Booked a return flight for my wife and my self to visit our son and family in Melbourne. Our flight was due to depart at 6.10am. We were informed at 8.30pm the night before that the flight had been cancelled due to operational problems, whatever that means. Tried to rebook on any flight that day but was informed all seats had been booked. The only flight available was the next day at the same time. One day lost as we were not allowed to rebook our return flight a day later. Friends laughed when I told them we had booked with Jetstar as this appears to be a regular occurrence with this airline. Jetstar may be cheap but I doubt if we will fly with them, again. I pity the ladies working in the chat centre as they must get some very abusive calls regarding the operation of this airline.",1
"Air Asia Indonesia. KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays. The first was due to arriving aircraft (two hours) and the second was due to ATC in SIN (boarded on time but one hour delay on the plane). The seats were comfortable for the short flights. The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap sure but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting. For our flight KUL-CGK there was no announcement of any delay until after the scheduled departure time (but they kept making announcements for other delays). Bring your patience for sure.",0
We travel KUL-MEL almost once a month for business. Not happy with the booking system as it tries to sell you everything from Hot Seats to Baggage to Insurance etc. and every time we book we have to be careful to delete all these items as it gives you Hot seats to charge you more. Other airlines leave it to you to add on items you wan to purchase and this is more practical. They should make their booking system more User Friendly! Punctuality is ok and they have improved a lot over the years. Most of the staff are friendly.,0
"I was departing from the Kansai Osaka terminal 2. Terrible check in service. The person was in a terrible mood and it showed.  I checked in online and the website told me my check in was incomplete and I needed to check in at the counter. My turn in line came and the person took my passport. He asked for my seat number. I didnt have it since my online check in was incomplete. We had a little dispute where he mentioned I needed to provide him a seat number and I told him I dont have it and needed to complete my check in at the counter. I went to the colleague beside him since I just needed my tickets. He told his colleague to stop, asked me to stop wasting other peoples time, and told me to come back over. He eventually printed my tickets. Not to mention my checked in luggage was slightly off symmetrical from the luggage belt. He told me to adjust it.",1
"Sydney to Gold Coast. After the service I received from the people at the plane gate then charged $60 for 2kg of carry on luggage after being extorted to choose a seat, exactly the same carry on luggage flown twice with on Jetstar in the last 24 hours. I will never fly with Jetstar again. Fly any other airline.",1
My husband and I travelled to Sydney from Singapore on 9th March 2013 and returned from Sydney to Singapore at 16th March 2013. My expectation was pretty limited. We took a neck pillow and warm clothes to overcome the seat discomfort and temperature issue. We didn't hear any annoying call bells (accidentally pressed) either. Cabin crew were good as well. One disappointment might be the food which was not the dish we selected while buying tickets and also it would be too spicy for some people. Overall journey took 40 minutes more than the scheduled time. When coming back to Singapore the flight was delayed 35 minutes. We were fortunate enough to have no luggage issues.,0
"We bid and upgraded to ScootPlus on the flight to Berlin and thoroughly enjoyed it, but didn't receive option to bid on our return trip and as such paid for seats in the first row of ScootinSilence. Upon boarding realised that ScootPlus was more than half empty and inquired on the rates for an upgrade only to be told we would be charged the full fee of $310. While I understand the logic in a bid where the misc fees already paid for seats, food etc. would boost the chances of securing the upgrade, I don't see the case since we were already onboard, had reasonably comfortable seats, with meals reserved and couldn't take advantage of the additional baggage that an upgrade provided and so didn't proceed. Scoot could have earned additional $362 if both of us had upgraded without incurring additional costs but it didn't happen because of its illogical pricing and many ScootPlus seats were left empty. Mid-flight I walked around the cabin only to realised that many rows of first row seats in economy were empty when it was indicated full when I made my seat reservations. Be it technical glitch or last min cancellations, saving grace would be for the cabin crew to offer to shift me and my partner or the guy next to us given we had indicated that we were unhappy that our row was the only one completely full, but no initiative was taken. I'm also still waiting for my miles from the bid to upgrade to be credited. Yes, it's a miserable 302 miles but Scoot should honour what it promised. Prior to this trip I had many good experience with Scoot and would pick it over many full service carriers, but after this trip I would think twice.",1
"Flew from Bangkok to Perth via Singapore. I like Scoot's 787 aircraft and the Economy class seats are some of the most comfortable around. For point to point travel they are a good deal, but I won't be using them for connecting flights again and here's why. Although Scoot will sell you an itinerary with connecting flights, the transit time can be very long. My original outbound schedule was changed such that it would have taken over 29 hours to arrive in Bangkok. I decided to connect in Singapore to another airline instead. Scoot does have a well-hidden policy for Australian travellers only, which allows for refunds in very limited circumstances - I did eventually get a partial refund on my flight, but only after I involved the Consumer Affairs authorities (and I still had to wait 10 weeks for the money). My return flight was a mere 17.5 hours elapsed, which was just about acceptable. But even though I had only carry on baggage, Scoot forced me to go through immigration in Singapore to get my onward boarding pass (after telling me in Bangkok that I could do this at the transfer desk). System limitations perhaps? Well no, if I had paid an extra $20 for ""Scoot-Thru"" they would have given me my boarding pass. Someone must have thought this was a great idea to make money out of customers, I think of it as a great way to lose customers. Another thing about connecting flights - according to the terms and conditions if you don't pay for Scoot-Thru and you miss your connection due to a delay by the airline, the airline won't help you at all - you've lost your flight! For the Singapore to Perth flight I paid THB970 for a ""super seat"". In extreme cases these seats can give you an extra 4 inches of leg room, but in my case it was only an extra 2 inches compared to my outbound flight - definitely not worth it. Speaking of extra expenses, the food is overpriced and awful. Vegetarian choices are particularly poor - and you're not allowed to bring your own. Scoot could have been a great airline, but by their mean-spirited practices they have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.",1
Melbourne to Hobart. We had 2 kg of overweight with our cabin luggage. At the gate before boarding our bags were weighed and we had to pay 65 dollars for the 2 kg overweight! This policy of punishing customers because of 2kg is ridiculous and we are very dissatisfied. also the service at the gate was very unfriendly,1
I was going from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and had a connecting flight from there to Copenhagen. I had nearly 6 hours to reach the connecting flight. Less than a week before going they cancelled the flight and rebooked me in a new one nearly 3 hours later. However this flight was delayed and I was too late to reach my flight. That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours. They could not see it as their problem that I was delayed more than 4 hours because of the rescheduling.,1
"Jetstar have the uncanny ability to need be at fault or feel the need to apologise for errors or omissions. From the call centre to ground staff and cabin crews, there is a unilaterally officious approach to nuisances, otherwise known as customers. Listening skills are decidedly absent and in general, the care factor hovers around zero. Legroom is an interesting euphemism for the wee gap between rows and I'm far from tall. Any opportunity to charge you additional is immediately seized upon. Refund is a word so unfamiliar to them it might as well be an ancient lost language. Email links don't work and the flight status web page too often sits and spins it's hamster wheel relentlessly without producing results. Definitely and sincerely, not a fan.",1
"Flew IndiGo from Bhubaneswar to Chennai. Travel was good, the flight crew were good too. The flight was on time. However there a strange high pitched sound just before take off which lasted for 5-10 minutes and the AC stopped working until the flight took off. The sound was again heard during landing too. The baggage at conveyer belt after the flight landed was messed up. On the same belt there was back to back baggage for 3 flights which was cumbersome and troublesome. I had to stand at the belt for an hour waiting to receive my luggage, it was very crowded with people looking for bags. Ground service was poor.",1
Flew them from MEL-AKL flight to AKL was delayed 1 hour because of a baggage discrepancy. Other then that the plane was nice and new staff were friendly. The return flight was on time and arrived a tad early. Was very smooth. On the way there my friend had 6 kg too much carry on baggage but the friendly staff let him off at 5.,0
"Luggage was lost when landed in Kuala Lumpur. When landed back in Singapore, went to luggage Center and the person said the luggage did not even leave Singapore and untraceable once it was checked in. But they still does not know where it is. Called the number they gave but no one has been picking up after one whole day of calling.  Really frustrating and disappointing",1
"Not adding anything new to what the other reviews have said. But avoid this airline. Jetstar lost my luggage for 3 days, requiring me to buy several hundred dollars worth of clothes and supplies. I sent them all my receipts as requested. In the email response below they acknowledged liability but refused to reimburse me. Unbelievable. ""I appreciate why you'd like us to compensation and that it's disappointing that I'm not able to do more for you on this occasion. I can confirm that bag was not received on flight JQ212 on 11/02/2023. A courtesy report has been created in Melbourne, case ID MELJQ51048 to trace the bag. However, our liability is limited and we are not in a position to cover your emergency expenses"".",1
"I checked into my Jetstar Airways flight from Sydney to Perth and went to the gate to find that that there are no powerpoints anywhere.  We boarded our flight and found ous seats were quite crammed. The flight was quite pleasant except the disappointment of a $5 voucher which could only buy a chocolate, nuts or a drink. The staff on the flight were very nice and friendly. On landing it was 11PM and we froze as the walk from the aircraft is outside.",0
MNL-DVO-MNL. Good experience and have no complaints. Paid extra for emergency row seats (about $2) and found the seating to be more than adequate. On the return they substituted an A319 for A320 and re-seated me in the proper row. Good basic transportation with a bit of a flair. Good value for money and a pleasant experience.,0
"They lied about connection in Narita and we lost all of our money with no refund. They have no agreements with any connecting airlines to transfer you once in Narita, hence they denied boarding and did not offer a refund. Nor did they advise of such at purchase. Lost $1000 with this airline.",1
"Bangalore to Chennai. This is the only airline I have flown that has such a hard restriction on carry-on weight: 7kg per person, period. This makes it impossible to carry a laptop bag and a carry-on with clothes. Even other low-cost airlines (eg. Jetstar) will allow you to pay for extra carry-on weight. As a business traveler flying 5 times in 8 days, this is a colossal waste of time waiting for checked bags at every stop. Not to mention the risk of an eventual misplaced bag.",1
Sunshine Coast to Sydney. So disappointed. Cancelled flight and wouldnt refund the money. Very unhelpful staff and wouldnt even help us out with transferring to Brisbane or an earlier date. I hope to never have to fly with this awful mob again.,1
Jetstar Airways cancelled my flight from Sydney to Brisbane. Very poor communication but as the return flight is with Jetstar they refused to give me a refund or airline credits. The booking was done through Expedia. Be very careful when booking through these site unless you buy travel insurance for domestic flights. Unfortunately I flying with Jetstar to Thailand in May. I hope the service is better. Very disappointed.,1
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur: flight on time fast boarding and very attentive staff. Great value for money. Just a little negative note about the low cost terminal in Kuala Lumpur: you have to walk a lot to reach the terminal the hot weather makes it more difficult together with the engine noises and the smell of fuel. Anyway I would fly again with Air Asia.,0
"I have to say that I didn't go into the flights with Scoot with high expectations, but at the end of the day, they were truly fantastic flights. The staff were fantastic on all 4 flights, there wasn't much food, but it was very tasty, the planes were comfortable and modern, and overall, I can only rate it positively. People expect a lot of luxury for little money, but for that price, it was really great service.",0
"Average experience this time only because of delays, otherwise ok experience. Reached Airport on time but flight got delayed by one an half hour in last moment due to operational reasons, in place of 23:35 it got rescheduled at 00:55, Traveling with only cabin baggage so no check in experience,. Cabin was clean and fresh, no doubt Indigo cabin cleaning is best in India. Seat pitch is little concern for someone with 6 feet but still ok for 2 hr flight. Paid meal served, those who didnt booked before would get only instant food like noodles or Upma. Overall reached Mumbai around 1 hr delayed whereas departed from Delhi around 1 and half hour.",0
"Osaka to Singapore. The check-in staff made me miss my flight. I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time, travelling with my husband and 5 year old son. They were not sure whether I needed a medical certificate. It took them 1 hour to check, telling me they were sure I did not need one. After 1 hour, they said the flight was closed and did not make any attempt to let us board. They asked me to pay to change my tickets for the next flight, which was a non-direct flight leaving 4 hours later, when I had paid for a direct flight. I called customer service, which said I should pay and make a claim later. At the end of the day, we took the next longer and non-direct flight, arriving home at 3am. This has been the most unpleasant check-in and flight experience I encountered so far.  I lodged a complaint with Scoot and never had any reply.",1
"Cebu to Manila. Customer Service useless. I had issues in booking, basically I have earned many Big Points along the years plus I had Credit Account Balance to get some discount during bookings. I have tried during different bookings to apply the credit I had with AirAsia but neither the Big Points or the Credit Account ever worked, I applied them but they magically disappeared whenever I click the magic button ""pay"" and the full amount has always been charged to my bank account. I have complained a couple of times but the only answer those ""customer service representative"" give is some template answer saying that they are sorry bla bla bla and my points are still there to redeem. This is ridiculous and disappointing, never had such a bad customer service being a Gold member as they call me.",1
"Kuala Lumput to Denpasar. Our flight was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and ATC tech issues. AirAsia informed us about the first delay on 11:30pm the day before our 7:45am flight, while this could have happened faster I was still able to adapt to it. After boarding we waited an other 60 min with very sparse information about why, roughly in the middle of wait we were informed that there are problems with ATC and at some point later we pushed back without further announcements. The seats were fine but had little comfort.  No IFE or WIFI available. AirAsia is fine for the price if everything works, if you have a problem you have a big one. Our return flight was rescheduled and offered to refund or rebook. I tried to rebook. To me the saving on airfare is not worth the very real possibility that you will spend a lot of energy and time being stressed by AirAsia messing up.",1
Over the past month I have flown Domestically several times in Thailand and last week flew Business Class to Australia. I will return to Thailand the same way. I am an Australian but have lived in Asia for the past 22 years. Air Asia has grown and improved remarkably over the past few month. The crew service food cleanliness of the planes are all now far superior than in the past. It is a low cost carrier but now it doesn't feel so much that way.,0
This was the first time I have travelled on Jetstar and since Qantas does not fly from Perth to Singapore I thought I would give Jetstar a try. What a great mistake that was! Yes I understand it is a budget airline but there was no service at all when they delayed the flight for more than 12 hours! I got to the airport about three hours in advance when ground staff said one can check in only two hours prior. An hour passed and when I approached them again to find out the flight had been delayed until the following morning at 4.40am and passengers would be able to collect a meal voucher worth SD$8.00 and that was it. We could not check in until 6pm. The least Jetstar can offer is some bottled water and increase the meal voucher which is less than Aus$10. To hang around with luggage for so many hours at terminal 1 is not fun at all and an inconvenience. Almost all the passengers said they will never fly with Jestar which I think is sad just because the management cannot be bothered to show that they actually care about their passengers.,1
My wife and I flew starclass / business from Melbourne to Bangkok return.it was much better than we had expected cannot see what people complain about if they had the same service as we did. You are not paying several thousands return on these flights so what you receive is very good value for money from Jetstar. We have already booked one way flights from Honolulu to Brisbane after a cruise next year in star class and we are looking forward very much to that flight. Inflight and ground crews were all very good.,0
Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,0
"I know Jetstar business class is not really business class but we have used it frequently to fly to Thailand and Singapore and when it was Starclass it was good. This last trip will be my last, I did not enjoy it at all. My husband and I did not sleep a wink as the seats were just too uncomfortable. I fail to see why we should pay the same price as row 1 passengers (we were row 2), when we have nowhere near the amount of legroom as row 1. Service was very average and I believe if you choose and pay for exit row seats with a premier airline in economy, it may be cheaper and more pleasant. Sad to see the service decline as it used to be a reasonable option. From now on, it's either true business class with a better airline, or we just don't go!",1
I was on CGK-SUB vv flight (QZ 7680 on Mar 17 and QZ 7685 on Mar 19). They were pretty much on schedule. Everything in general was good. The airline has revised the boarding procedure by managing the boarding passengers. Good strategy to minimize the ground time and maintain the on time performance although a bit inconvenient to the passengers.,0
"I flew Mumbai to Chennai on 21st Oct 2022. The inflight service was very bad. The announcement to buy food and beverages online was made but no crew came and asked if we would like to buy anything. When I called them to ask for a tin of cookies for my son, the 1st time I was told they need to serve pre booked meals 1st and then only they will get back to me, and the 2nd time again I asked while collecting trash and they said give us 5 minutes. So basically only pre booked meals passengers were given priority while those even though willing to buy in the air were not even asked if they wanted water. The crew just moved past my row and I had to call her back to ask for the cookies. If this is the kind of service offered, it's better IndiGo clearly states that only pre booked meals will be given any priority. Why make the false announcements of you may purchase any snacks you wish to. I would rate this kind of service negative. Very very disappointed.",1
Flew MAA-AMD on Indigo 6e-237. Check in went smoothly the flight was on time it was clean and appeared new and had ample legroom. The food was delicious. The flight crew were quick and efficient. Overall good experience and no problems. Would fly Indigo again.,0
"Jetstar are the same as any low cost airline in that they charge for everything, and are totally inflexible about any changes or limits. But that's expected, and really no worse than any other LCC. When something goes wrong (flight cancellation, rescheduling or delay), however, Jetstar reach a whole new level of terrible. Their staff are at best unhelpful and at worst incompetent. To be fair, the staff are hamstrung by Jetstar's ridiculous customer-hostile policies, even when the fault is theirs. They cancelled my flight from Honolulu-Melbourne, and were unable to get me on another flight for 3 days. When I purchased a ticket on a Hawaiian airlines flight to Sydney, Jetstar refused to put me on a Jetstar flight from Sydney to Melbourne. Unless you have flexibility of several days in your travel plans, I would recommend avoiding Jetstar.",1
KBV-BKK on A320. Flight on time bags a bit delayed its always the case in Bangkok. All in all quite a pleasant flight.,0
"Warning: AirAsia booking policies are deceptive! You can search for the best ticket price for a route and think that AirAsia is the lowest, but one page before you pay, AirAsia adds a significant ""processing fee"" without warning such that you cannot compare AirAsia's ticket price to another airline! The only way to check for the accurate ticket price is to go all the way through the booking process and almost purchase the ticket. This is unfair and deceptive! Stay vigilant!",1
"Flew Jakarta to Padang. This is the second flight I have flown in the last three weeks. The delay remains the same. I got a 60 to 90 minute delay today, the same as the last one. It is like delays are part of the behaviour and culture in this airline. In this era, where people are very busy and don't have one day only to fly from one place to another, Lion Air needs to learn to respect people's time. So, if you do not have the whole day spare time just to fly, Lion Air is the last choice you should make. The delay in my flight, I admit is my mistake, since I am the one who chose this airline at the beginning.",1
"I submitted an app check in and it was successfully submitted. I had no check in baggage so I only went to the airport 50min before the flight to print my boarding pass and board the plane. But when i went to the airport it was not reflected on the system and they said I was not checked in and as such cannot check in anymore as counter is closed. The only solution was to buy a new air ticket. And I was not given a choice of seats and was asked to purchase what i later found out to be the most expensive seat on the plane, a hot seat, which I did not ask for. A simple trip air ticket cost doubled and totally ruined my trip.",1
Flew NKG-SIN-MLE-SIN-NKG. The airline has good seats compared to other airline. They currently don't have inflight entertainment so you can only read their magazine or do something on your phone to entertain yourself. I didn't purchase food nor drinks but the food and drinks seems expensive even by airport standards. On the way back to Nanjing the flight was delayed for 12 hours due to bad weather. They gave food vouchers for use in Changi Airport. The flights from SIN-MLE-SIN were operated by Tigerair.,0
Flew with Lion few times while I was in Indonesia for holiday. CGK-MDC MDC-DPS-MDC. It wasn't a very good experience checking-in at Soekarno Hatta crowded and very unorganised! Could hardly move and food wasn't included. Flights were on time though which was a good thing. It wasn't a bad experience but wasn't the best either.,1
"1-in check in they charged us unexpectedly 3K~ peso, first time in domestic Philippines flight after more then 5 with other companies-none proportional for check in luggage 20Kg Standard. 2- after check in and 2 approves bags of 7 Kg, we have been stopped at boarding and charged for additional 2K. It was small laundry bags and the plane was empty! I am very disappointed, it is very not proportional, first time some company do it to me! There was no space issue! They doubled our tickets cost, it is our honeymoon, we were very unpleased.",1
Flew Scoot from Singapore to Hanoi. My visa had the wrong dates and I was not going to be allowed on the plane to Hanoi. The check-in agent told me a customer had a similar situation last month and was able to secure a visa letter online quickly but it cost a bomb. I searched it online and was able to secure a new visa within 15 minutes and was able to make my flight! Without that agent's suggestion I would not have had my weekend break in Hanoi! Thanks so much for the extra service.,0
"I had a truly pleasant experience today. Although the hard product dies not meet international business class standards the price compensates for this. For a 10 hour daytime flight I was comfortable. Seat and space is equal to a domestic US first class flight. The food is generous but served on one tray with little flair. On this flight there was a full breakfast and later a decent lunch. Both meals offered options and were tasty. In addition you can request anything from the economy offerings (sandwiches, snacks etc) free of charge at any time. The flight attendants were efficient and very cordial. The IFE was decent but rebooted about three or four times( again not great hard product)Flight was early and baggage arrived quickly( no business tags) I am happy that I am not taking the return overnight flight as without flat bed seats, sleep was next to impossible for me. I do feel like I got more than my moneys worth and was treated very kindly in flight. Id take another daytime flight anytime.",0
"Adelaide to Coolangatta. Ridiculous lack of communication from Jetstar and last minute cancellation of flights for no good reason! I had to travel for my dads funeral and having my flight cancelled with little notice added to the extreme stress, anxiety and trauma I am experiencing. Had to book another flight and spend another $200! Their prices may seem low but youre better off spending the extra few bucks for an airline who will actually provide good customer service and wont randomly cancel flights.",1
16 March SG to BKK TZ302. 18 March BKK to SG TZ 301. This is my 2nd time taking Scoot to Bangkok this time in their business class. Staff were attentive and quick. Excellent leg space too.,0
"We booked a round trip domestic flight with AirAsia Philippines from Manila to Cebu in February. Our first flight was delayed by 45 minutes at first, then delayed again with no known departure time. Luckily we only had to wait about 30 more minutes before we began boarding. However, the second delay was not reported to flight status sites.  The return flight isn't going much better. It was delayed for an hour and a half already. Fingers crossed it doesn't get delayed a second time.",1
"Chiang Mai to Phuket. Worst airline. They charged my family of Four 5,000 bht ($227 CAD = $56 CAD/person) upon arrival to check our bags. They go by weight. Apparently you can pay the fee online which is 400 bht but they dont advertise it much. They also offer the lower price if youre 4 hours early (who would come that early). When we complained they said thats how it is and werent accommodating. Also no flight entertainment or food service on our flight. Would highly recommend a different airline.",1
BLR-BOM on the early morning flight. Cabin was clean. FAs attentive and courteous. We had pre-booked snacks and served a good Veg Sandwich and juice. Quite good. Other choices too were available.,0
Jetstar positions itself as a discount airline in Asia. I would rate this airline as the worst in the world. The service is pathetic. Check-in slow. Every time I have flown the flight has been late. Today the flight is 7 hours late. There is no recognition of Qantas platinum frequent flier status at check-in. No priority baggage. Extra fees for seat selection and charges for bags. If I had been on any other airline I would have received at least some courtesies as a frequent customer. I have been trying to upgrade my Tokyo to Melbourne flight for two months. I booked through Qantas. When trying to upgrade Jestar says you need Qantas to upgrade the flight. But Qantas says they cannot access Jetstar a system because it's a different airline - so upgrade with jetstar. On the flight the entertainment system is very poor. The food awful. I flew business class from Melbourne to Bangkok. The food was terrible. My seat would not recline properly. In truth - it's like flying a 1980s business class seat. And the planes feel about the same.,1
Recently travelled from Brisbane to Launceston and over the past 4 months I have made many return trips due to my moving. The flight times are very convenient and all but one flight was on time with departure and sometimes early on arrival. One flight was 25 minutes late due to weather which is of no consequence. All aircraft's were clean and cabin crew were fine. Several times I had emergency exit seats offered which I accepted and have no complaint with my treatment. I don't usually purchase food as I am sure I can survive for 2.5 hrs. The fares were all cheap easy to book and are good value. As always you get what you pay for. I rarely take luggage so the fare structure suits me and I always pay via Direct Debit to save on Credit Card Fees. One of my return trips via Melbourne was actually with Parent Company Qantas and this flight was nowhere near as pleasant as the Jetstar flights. Its just a shame that I see poor behaviour on these flights from fellow passengers over fairly minor problems.,0
DEL-CCU-DEL NAG-DEL a few times and happy to take IndiGo. The seat pitch makes me feel a little cramped at times but otherwise is excellent. The crew is courteous and always ready to help.,0
"Gold Coast to Melbourne. This is the worst Airline I have ever seen. Horrible customer care, rude. Would not recommend this company to anyone.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Horrible service. The face-to-face service at the time of boarding was humiliating and unnecessary, the official started to Scream saying that I didn't have the ticket of boarding while I was looking for the boarding on my bag. I find it give to him and after that they tore up my ticket claiming that I had not understood the first time they asked me if there had been an emergency and they moved the seat to humiliate me even more in front of several customers who were in the queue.",1
"Bali to Melbourne. Had two flights delayed. The first was for ""operational reasons"" - from looking into it I just think they were trying to squeeze in an extra flight, we never got an explanation. We have two young children so the ""alternative"" flights they offered for the first delay didn't work. Ended up canceling and re booking flights a few days later at a significant cost. The second flights also ended up being delayed by a day due to technical issues. I can understand that it happens sometimes and was OK with it. Jetstar offered to pay for accommodation and a meal allowance for the 4 of us up to at total of of US $700. I have receipts etc but have so far been offered reimbursement of of US$250. I emailed twice, no response and spent about 7 hours on live chat getting nowhere and making me feel like I am the one in the wrong. This is only half of it but I'm not going to go on.",1
Melbourne-Newcastle return JQ477 29th May and 474 30th May. Both flights were on time. Tight legroom made a bit more bearable for short flights by having magazines etc behind the headrests rather than jammed up against one's knees. On the forward journey I observed the cabin manager briefing a passenger with mobility issues about safety aspects of the flight. She displayed a truly caring and professional approach and I was impressed. On both flights most people were fairly obviously leisure flyers - I am happy to travel Jetstar when flying for leisure but would not recommend it for business travellers.,0
Ground crew if this airline company needs customer service training. They practically would not even explain things clearly. They think the few words they say rudely would be enough to satisfy the customers. I would rather not argue with them and just submit a review.,1
"Indigo flight from Bengaluru to Mumbai. Due to the flight schedule modifications due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts, I had to do a last minute booking on Indigo which came at a steep price but as I was required to travel had no other choice. The check-in was a breeze and boarding / departure started on time. The aircraft was well maintained and even though every seat was practically full, the crew did well to manage things and requests from fellow passengers. The seat pitch is around 30 inches which is decent enough but might be more uncomfortable for someone taller. The flight was very smooth and the crew were very pleasant and indulged in small talk among the passengers when it came for the in-flight snacks which were kind of pricey. Arrival was on time and the captain of the flight announced that this was his last flight and so all the passengers were requested to send their best wishes to the captain during de-boarding which was a nice touch. A very pleasant flight experience indeed. Thank you Indigo.",0
"The customer service lady was lovely, customer service policy is terrible. They are given no authority to help customers on very reasonable requests. When pressing the customer service worker to talk to supervisor after being told to call back later and wait another hour on wait line, Im put on hold again and told exact same thing... there is no supervisor and no authority for customer service person to do anything. This is after an aggregate of 5 hours on phone. This is not normal for an airline. I fly often and Cebu airways offer a uniquely poor service. I feel sorry for their customer service staff and very let down as a customer as these are clearly cynical top down policies that could easily be reviewed for a satisfying customer experience and of no disadvantage to the airline. I will not fly with Cebu again.",1
BKK-MNL-BKK. Check-in in both BKK and MNL was efficient. NAIA-3 very quick. I usually buy the 20kg Baggage Allowance just to avoid the hassle. Both flights were on time even late in the day but arrival into BKK was delayed because the pilot parked incorrectly and had to be pushed back to the correct position... Cabin Service was fine but the flights were quieter than usual I think because many passengers (me included) are flying Tiger from Clark to BKK because in some cases it's half the price of Cebu Pacific who are not significantly cheaper than Philippine Airlines on some routes. I've been looking at prices over the next few months and Cebu Pacific need to be more competitive if they want to fill their planes like they did a few years back.,0
"Sydney to Singapore. Utterly appalling! I know it is a budget airline, but there's no excuse for getting the basics wrong. Flying out of Sydney to Singapore on Dec 29th, the check-in queue was the longest I have seen one in my life - it went past the barriers and all the way down the public area to almost the next main exit. Apparently they had delayed a flight the night before and it was now leaving about the same time as ours 1.30pm / 3pm no problem, that happens. But in this case, they know exactly how many people are going to be arriving, and when, and there were so few staff checking people in it was ridiculous. I barely moved for 30 mins (in the queue where the check-in counters were so far away I couldn't even see them) and was now less than hr from take -off. The let me skip the q but they should have had people separating the queue into the 1.30 and 3pm flights from the outset. A text message to flyers saying to expect delays at check in and arrive earlier would have also been a no-brainer. On the flight itself, it took nearly 2 hours for the drink carton to come around, by which stage a man at the back was dehydrated and distressed. The menu in the pocket related also to a different flight. I travel by budget airlines frequently but will never fly Scoot again.",1
In my trip to Japan I decided to fly back to Tokyo from Osaka on Jetstar Japan. Staff at the check-in counter were helpful and friendly. The flight however was delayed for about 20-30 minutes but without any announcement. It was generally good for a short-haul flight domestically in Japan.,0
"Gold Coast to Sydney. No value for money and time of customers. My flight was scheduled for departure 45 minutes ago. Half an hour ago, it was announced that the flight will leave in 30 mins. We are still waiting at the gate due to engineering trouble. This is not the first time Im experiencing this from this airlines. Unhappy with the service.",1
"Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Flew this sector return and used AirAsia as previous experiences have been positive. The airline is moving towards gouging their guests for every penny and placing restrictions which encourage you to buy on-board. I am appalled at their current policy of no outside food or drink on board. In terms of the flight, punctual, clean planes, professional crew. The cabin temperature on KUL - DPS leg was arctic like and almost tropical on the DPS - KUL leg. Legroom is non existent and woe betide you get a kid behind you or a sleepy recliner in front. I enjoyed their no frills approach when it was just that, now they have overstepped the mark. Their only saving grace is the speedier Immigration counters at KLIA2 over the slow ones at KLIA.",1
SUB-BKK then BKK-HKT-BKK and last KUL-SUB. The crew was impolite and unfriendly. When onboard from SUB to BKK and KUL to SUB I always found that my seat couldn't recline because the button had broken the seat pitch also unacceptable. When I was in the LCC terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. This airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you. AirAsia really disappointed me.,1
Gold Coast to Singapore December 23rd 2013. Singapore to Gold Coast January 7th 2014. If you want a budget airline with no frills substandard food at premium prices that charges you every time you blink then this airline is for you. I can understand extra for food drinks (even water) entertainment but to charge you for checking in early is a pathetic money grabbing option. Only $5 but no mention of fee at early check-in sign at airport after queuing in line for 20 minutes and many complaints from other passengers a staff member came from behind the counter to tell you of the charge when you are two passengers from the counter and by the time we got to the counter we were only 5 minutes early. However the aircraft was clean seat comfortable (just a little narrow) but plenty of legroom. Will not travel with thrm again if other airlines are available.,1
"I have spent over six hours across three days to confirm a booking via Indigo airline's payment processor (CC Avenue). I original tried to book with a US bank card. This process failed with vague messages, then I received an email stating I should wait 20 minutes for my booking to be confirmed. If not confirmed in 20 minutes I should make another payment on the booking PNR or if payment is confirmed and no booking confirmed, I need to wait one week for my money to be returned. Both my US banks flagged Indigo transactions as fraud. To make things worse, none of the five booking or payment processor representatives demonstrated they understand what PNR or airline's standard rules are. The phone systems were so bad that I was disconnected over 4 times and every representative had connection and audio issues. Now day three and 6 hours into a booking process where my Chase account has pre approved my payment, the last rep I worked with asked me to wait one hour for a call back because Indigo's payment systems were offline.",1
"I was pleased to note that during the online check in for this flight, the seat selection was free because in previous experiences of flying with IndiGo, they usually charge a fee of around Rs 150 for selecting a seat. The baggage drop was a smooth process and departure was on time. The crew took steps to check for negative RT-PCR reports or proof of fully vaccinated during the time of boarding which was appreciated. Arrival was on time and IndiGo did the job of transporting from point A to B in a fairly reasonable price for a 1 hour 40 minute flight.",0
"India  Goa (GOI) to Udaipur (UDR) The colour indigo is fresh and happy  even saying the word out loud makes me smile. The airline IndiGo is no different. Keeping in mind that this is a low-cost carrier, it was virtually impossible to tack any negativity onto this airline. They embrace a fun outlook on just about everything, from their inflight magazine, titled 6E (pronounced sexy), to their luggage buggies on the tarmac, called Ground Force. Yes, the seats are narrow (no worse than any other budget airline) and they dont recline, which is a blessing when youre trying to watch a video on your tablet/phone  thats right, the seats do not have monitors built-in. You pay for food and beverages (its the norm now), but the prices are fair and some of the snacks are served in fun packaging that you might even want to take home. I know I did. I still have my Nut Case. Blue is my favorite colour, and now IndiGo is my favorite budget airline. Four Thumbs Up",0
Flown with Lion Air CGK-SIN-CGK on 22 and 24 respectively using their (rather) new single isle Boeing 737-900. Flown with about almost 1.5 hours of delay for the return leg but it is Changi so I won't complain. What I notice about this airline is that they provide more (just a little more) room for International flights. Had no problem fitting in my legs (I am 184cm tall) a little cramped but nothing compared to my last CGK-DPS-CGK flight. That being mentioned I can't actually say much about the level of comfort that I get from LCCs you get what you pay! Now lowering down my standard to the level of LCCs Lion Air is a pleasant airline to fly with. What they can do to improve passenger satisfaction is to improve their punctuality. Lion Air has been the master of all delayed flights and with their new 700 aircraft's in order they can improve their means of operation too.,0
Melbourne to Denpasar. I have travelled for the better half of 15 years around the world and this is by far the worst airline I have dealt with. Pathetic excuse of a company. I will never fly Jetstar again,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. AirAsia always gave me a good journey to reach my destination, but one thing i dislike about the airline is the lack of inflight entertainment. I know its a low cost airline but that doesn't mean that they can't implement inflight entertainment. The  seats are small espeically the leg room,  but they are uncomfortable and quite disappointing.",0
We flew Jetstar to Singapore as Qantas no longer flies from Perth on 8 August. The flight was due to leave at 00.05am and we were dropped off at the airport at 9.45pm. It was not until we arrived at the desk that we found out the flight had been delayed until 10.55am and all we were offered was a food voucher. We were not notified of any changes via email or SMS event hough the airline had both. Another couple had driven for 3 hours to get to the airport and therefore had to find accommodation overnight. If we wish to use our points to go overseas we have to fly Jetstar. Come on Qantas pick up your game for Perth or you will lose all customers. We are looking at using our points and going to another company.,1
"Really happy with the 12 month voucher policy of Jetstar. It offers great flexibility without sinking the airline and it was really easy to request online, came in a few days later.",0
Amritsar to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur booked for April 2020. Im still waiting for my ticket canceled money they didnt refund ticket money ticket was canceled from AirAsia because Covid-19.,0
"Completely incompetent, four hour delay out of Sydney, waiting 8 hours in the airport wiling 3 kids. Finally get to Manila, one lost bag- just happens to be all of my wife and youngest  daughters clothes. Two hours trying to sort this out and find someone that can help - out of the airport 6 hours late, missed a dinner and dramas with hotel due to lateness. Fast forward 4 days after little contact and even less helpfulness we drive 45 minutes to pick up the bag. Another 4 days later still waiting on needed forms to claim compensation after having to buy new clothes for two family member over Christmas. This is causing so much tension on what should be a family holiday.",1
"Lion Air manages to constantly disappoint even when expectations are extremely low after flying with them from time to time the last four years. Planes are often canceled and almost always delayed by hours. Information is scarce and the unfortunate personnel is constantly stressed to make the best of a horribly managed airline. All other airlines in Indonesia are better. At the very least you would expect to get to where you are going, this is not always the case with lion air as they frequently cancels flights, and good luck getting refunds. If they do fly that day you can expect a delay of 1-6 hours. Again forget any compensation (which they are legally required to provide). During this inevitable delay, expect to get zero information. I'd literally go to the counter and ask if the plane will be on time 20 min before and they say yes. When I ask if the plane has arrived yet they do not know, and when they check it's still somewhere else. I then ask when it will arrive to this airport and the staff would then sms or WA the ground staff of the previous airport asking when the plane left. When the plane do arrive at the airport it will have missed any slot it was allocated and get allocated a gate on the other side of the airport. Due to low prices lion air is the only airline trafficking some destinations. Try to avoid always, pay triple to do so if you can, it's always worth it.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Sihanoukville. I entered check in a little late. The staff took my main baggage and sent it to the plane, but there was a problem with my hand luggage and they asked me to pay 50 dollars for 3 kg. Immediately after paying the extra $ 50, the doors were closed and they said they couldn't take me to the plane, and they didn't pay my $50 behind by 5 minutes. We also heard a lot of scolding.",1
"Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar Airways. Unhelpful and rude gate staff. Just an all round poor experience. On arrival to the gate there was a queue to get bags weighed and then a separate queue for boarding. When my bag was weighed I was a couple over. The man said I could put some heavy items of clothing on to see if this would reduce the weight. When I stepped to the side to try, a employee approached me and told me I have 2 minutes to try to reduce the weight or I might not get on the flight. This was a whole 45 minutes before the flight was due to take off. She was rude and obnoxious. Avoid at all cost.",1
Hong Kong to Krabi. A couple that travel together and also book together the ticket should be seatead next to each other but at check in they say 'sorry seat are given by computer' so we didn't seat next to each other. Super annoying.,1
"Once again, Jetstar did not disappoint. Returning to Hobart the same day, Jetstar's schedules and prices make a day trip pleasantly possible. Cabin crew were pleasant and performed their duties with smiles and conversation. The return flight was about 90 minutes delayed. I did not find this to be a problem, and I heard no complaints from other passengers. I have international flights booked with Jetstar, early in 2016. I am confident that they will be just as pleasant.",0
"Jetstar cancelled my flight at less than 12 hours notice. They refunded the ticket as they were unable to get me on a flight within 3 days and I needed to be in Perth (for a wedding, which I will now miss). They refused to extend any goodwill beyond the flight refund - no assistance with a hotel in Singapore, even though it's not my home base and even though their email said they would compensate. Confirming this with the idiotic robot customer service staff they said indeed they would not pay for hotel. So now I'm stranded in a city I don't live in, with nowhere to sleep this evening.",1
Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,0
Travelled for the first time with Jetstar in January to Launceston. Check in took 50 minutes at Sydney (just as well we were early). When on the plane I had to sit sideways as there was not enough leg room my teenage sons also had the same problem. The lady in front of me tried to recline her seat during the flight but could not because my knee was jammed up against the back of her seat. I had to ask her to stop trying to recline as it was hurting my knees. I Think Jetstar are greedy as they are understaffed and there are too many rows of seats on the plane for people of average size. Next holiday it will be back to Virgin.,1
Lombok to Jakarta. I had charges on my credit card for a second unidentified charge that I did not have an invoice for. There was no live customer service at all I could speak to and to investigate this charge and or provide me an invoice. India customer service refused to assist me. Had to dispute the charge with the credit card company since I do not have any details or invoice for these charges. They do not provide any customer service only an automated computer bot that is useless.,1
"Sydney to Melbourne. Jetstar staff need to learn what customer service is, they do not know how to welcome their customers, speak or address (no hi how are you, may I help you, sorry the flights been delayed, move here, put your bag here, pay here, terrible monotone announcements) customers or even hold a conversation! Very rude in approaching customers, even though we are all waiting back an hour for their delayed plane. Not worth saving the extra $50 to go budget airline. To top it off just tried contacting them direct to provide feedback and was cut off by the customer service person who diverted me to an online survey instead.",1
SIN-CNX-SIN. Good value for money. New A320-200 both ways. All flights on time. Aircraft clean spacious. Load only 50%. No IFE. FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg. When purchase ticket one has to be careful not to be trapped purchasing expensive seating and superfluous insurance.,0
"Singapore to Jakarta. There's no space to put my laptop bag on the top, because already full with cabin luggage. Stewardess also doesnt want try to find out the space. So I should put my laptop bag, my wallet bag under chair, my feet doesnt have space & not comfortable for trip 2 hours. It should be that luggage move to other space and this responsibilities cabin crew to find out.not sacrifice other passenger which pay the same price but got different service. Disappointed with their service.",1
"Queenstown to Sydney. My flight was delayed 3.5 hours but that was not the issue. Its the fact that they then lost the baggage of 15 people and did not tell anyone. Once I arrived in Sydney I waited for my bag in baggage claim for about 30 minutes until I went over to a desk to ask about it. Apparently many bags did not make the flight. This does not make much sense because they had my bag more than 4 hours before take-off and there was only 1 other international flight at that time. They also did not inform anyone else via email or anything until we went to ask about it. They promise 24 hour delivery of lost baggage but that is completely false. They also said they would send me an email with all of the information which was also false. And finally, they provided a baggage tracking site that does not work at all. I had to call them to get my reference number so that I could check, but when I enter my information, surprisingly the site that looks like it's from 2002 does not work.",1
Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary. Next time we pay more and fly with anyone but Jetstar.,1
"Jetstar cancelled our flight last at the last minute from Melbourne back to Sydney today evening 09 feb 2023 and when we walk over to speak to services desk the attitude that we got from JetStar staffs was absolutely disgusting, rude, arrogant and zero compassion toward every single person passenger.  Not one single word of sorry and rudely telling everyone off.",1
"My Virgin Flight from Coolangatta to Sydney was cancelled so I headed to Jetstar customer service desk and Dylan went above and beyond to help me with arranging an alternative flight to Sydney. As you can imagine it was chaos with so many passengers trying to organise alternative flights to their destinations. He remained calm, friendly patient and professional at all times. Trying to book a flight online during this time was not available as internet must have been overloaded with so passengers trying to organise alternative flights. Dylan took it upon himself to call customer service and booked my flight over the phone without question and all was done and paid for within 10 minutes. Thank you so much for your assistance.",0
SIN-SYD-SIN. Booked Super seats and prepaid meal on both legs. Ordinary airline food nothing much to talk about. The Super seat pitch was much more than any legacy airlines economy seats it is even better than SIA economy seats. As long as you comes prepared bring your own travel pillow blanket (or jacket) an empty bottle for water plus your own tablet or notebook for entertainment you are going to have a very enjoyable flight. Will definitely fly with them again no problem.,0
Flew Air Asia in June 2014 from Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. The Surat Thani airport is very small you go down an escalator and walk onto the tarmac to board the plane. The plane boarded on-time and very quickly. The flight staff were still vacuuming when I boarded! They boarded the plane quickly and had an easy departure and easy landing. The distance between seats is really small. I am not a big person but these seats are very close! They do recline but not much. Not very comfortable for a long flight but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though. I paid extra for a seat assignment one piece of luggage and a chicken dinner. Total came to around $2600 Bhat which is about $80 USD. For a short flight it was fine although the seats are not very comfortable.,1
"The trip was so unpleasant, except for the ticket price. When I lined up to check in in the beginning, the staff recommended me to use its kiosks. She said it would save time. Well, she did not mention, the success rate for using kiosks is less than 10%. I ended up lining up again from the very end. The luggage check-in tooks forever for most of travelers.  It took me one and half hours to see the counter agent finally. My ticket was issued within 5 minutes. So i was puzzled why it took others so long. The boarding process was out of order. Nobody guided you how and where to line up. One staff just held a sign saying ""Row 45 and up"" boarding. But she could not be seen most of the time and the sign was up and down. Nobody paid any attention to it. Suddenly she announced ""All boarding"". Hundreds of traveler started to line up several lines for one gate. The entertainment options was limited and outdated. Luckily i downloaded my own movies and music the night before. Anyway, ZipAir does not have any characters of normal Japanese airline, efficient, polite and punctual. It is a budget airline at most. Avoid at all cost.",1
"Shantou to Bangkok. With my knowledge having boarded AirAsia I simply lowered my expectation of inflight service to zero. Beautiful flight attendants were there greeting me. The plane took off as scheduled. The meal plan I pre-booked is served at a comfortable pace. They were using 2 flight attendants, one is to do everything and another is just to stand there and hand out the food. I have no idea whether it is the best way of serving on board but I see many flight attendants who are serving passengers more actively. They refused my Chinese money once I ordered a can of coke. I have given them 14RMB, the flight attendant returned me with 2RMB and said it is too old. As a passenger I can't the control or reject the legal money given to me from a supermarket, can I? Can they refuse legal bank notes?",1
Launceston to Sydney. Our flight was delayed over 24 hours. There were open seats on other flights but the airline would not release our baggage. The reason given was that they did not have adequate ground staff to unload the baggage from the plane. We just went over 12 hours from the last update on status of the flight When I asked if there was a manager to whom we could provide feedback the answer was no When trying to submit a claim for direct costs associated with the flight we spent over an hour trying to upload receipts but each time the customer service agent terminated the session before the claim could be submitted There is no email address to send a claim to. No phone number to call. No form that one can complete with a claim This was our first trip to Australia. We had paid a significant amount to have two nights in Sydney. Instead we will have 8 hrs from 11pm to 7am to see the City. This airline is a disgrace. I have never experienced this lack of communication or customer service Do us all a favor.,1
"Good value for money, uneventful short hop from JKT to KUL, early morning. Good value for money regarding pre-ordered meal, easy check-in and clean airplane. Nice crew.",0
"Melbourne to Launceston. Low cost as in cheap in every way. They nickel and dime you for everything and absolutely gouge you for any extra weight. Want water? That is extra. Pick a seat? Extra. They are the Spirit Airlines of Australia, just a glorified bus company with wings. Never again.",1
"Scott from Sydney to Singapore. Boarding was slow and not helped by two passengers who failed to board, but despite this departure was only eight minutes late. I had an aisle seat with a couple next to me in the window and middle seat, so I soon transferred to an empty middle block of three. The seats are narrow - about 43-45cm but having three allowed me to snooze quite comfortably and better than in what is euphemistically called 'business class' with minimal recline and those horrible large non retractable armrests. Why would anyone waste an extra A$200 plus one way for less comfort? Staff were friendly but the design of the light and call buttons (and 'cancel call' button) in the armrest meant they frequently went to seats where passengers had mistakenly pressed it. Which designer thought of this? The meals are horribly expensive and a small icecream (we'd call it a 'buddy' in Australia) was an extortionate A$6. I brought my own water filled at Sydney Airport after passenger screening: a small Evian bottle on board was an outrageous A$4 with no free tap water available. There was an inadequate number of toilets on board (five for about 295 seats in economy class, although there were a total of slightly less than 300 on board including in so-called ScootBiz.) The F and B prices are way above Cebu Pacific. . There is no entertainment on board except for self service. That attracts a charge. We arrived Singapore about three minutes late.",1
Travelled Perth to Singapore on new route. Checking in was straight forward and plane on time. When boarding they asked people at the back of the plane to board first not sure what seat numbers this included. Got on board and had a stretch seat plenty of leg room which was great news being over 6 foot. Generally the seats are more comfortable than any budget airline I have travelled did notice the 3-4-3 is much tighter than the 3-3-3 with Singapore Airlines on the same plane but was ok. Food and tablet arrived quickly once we took off and I was seated very close to back of plane. Big issue was that they collected tablet an hour before we landed I managed to watch one movie and half of another. Even with watching tablet as soon as I received and whilst eating. Food was tasty and very spicy with a can of coke and a small pack if Pringles this was a pre paid meal. Overall a very good service comparable to other economy services better than any budget airline I have travel led with. When booking look at what's important to you if the price is better than economy go for it.,0
"Phuket to Hanoi via Bangkok. I wasnt sure about AirAsia at first, but we had absolutely no problem. I am scared to fly, but it was a smooth ride. No food or entertainment provided, which was fine as it was under 2 hours flight. I would definitely fly again.",0
Penang to Bangkok. Late and there is no explanation nor updates. This is the 2nd air asia flight in less than a week and both are delayed. It wasn't like this a few years back. Has it expanded too big and they cannot cope?,1
"This airline is a nightmare. Initial leg from Sydney to Adelaide was cancelled via text message at 2am in the morning for a 6am flight, we had to wait until 5pm that evening. Flight was packed and staff were clearly overstressed and very unhappy. One hostess on the plane bit my head off for asking a simple question about where they were taking my bag. Flight was also delayed as a replacement staff member had to be flown in. Return trip from Adelaide 3 days later also cancelled. We ended up getting a refund and booking a flight with REX who were totally awesome.",1
March 2015 Gold Coast to Singapore to Taipei and return with stopover. Be prepared and read the fine print as if you don't expect anything other than what they say you won't be disappointed! The flight was very cheap and absolutely no frills - no pillows blankets tea or coffee included. They are clear about this on their website any extras have to be paid for. Do not expect staff to be there to look after you although I found them all to be pleasant and polite. The food did not look to be worth buying we took sweets and small snacks for the kids and were not questioned on this although customers in front of me were asked to put their own food away. There was a free drinking water dispenser near the toilets on all the planes we travelled on but you had to go and get this yourself in your own bottle or cup. The seats were reasonable (except for the dreadful position of the call button). They like to board the planes really early so be prepared for that. We left on time each flight with one major upset with one flight where 2 hours from Singapore to Taipei we had to turn back to Singapore due to a medical issue with a passenger on board. I was surprised we did not even get a free cup of tea after what was ultimately a 5 hour delay - beyond their control admittedly but some recognition of the inconvenience would have been appropriate. Another delay due to weather when leaving Taipei was affecting all aircraft so once again frustrating but not their fault. No problems with baggage at all and although a very slow check in at Gold Coast Changi and Taoyuan check ins were a breeze. Did saving around $4000 in fares for a family of 5 make up for the inconveniences of the flight? Absolutely! Be prepared for the flight and you can splurge a lot more on the important stuff - the actual holiday!,0
"Singapore to Gold Coast. Unpleasant check in counter in Singapore. Staff was shouting at the customer ""this is the business class check in counter!"" without checking our tickets when we queue at business check in counter (we have purchased ScootBiz!). Seats hard small (not like Jetstar's business class). Itinerary stated inflight entertainment blanket pillow eye mask food and beverage. After take off nothing was given. When we asked for the blanket and other stuff was told that no longer available. We have to insist these are stated on the itinerary and was only given blanket. When we ask for water was told to pay $3 per bottle. Sent in feedback to customer service with no reply.",1
Flew Melbourne to Adelaide with a toddler and baby. Unfortunately flew Jetstar as it fitted in best with nap times. Staff didn't even try to help as I struggled up the rear stairs with baby in sling toddler and bag. Consistently the worst customer service of all of the Australian airlines. Reiterated why I will only ever fly Jetstar if the timing and route is by far the best option.,1
Have been flying Air Asia for 5 years and now only when I have to. A discount airline but prices keep going up. Seats are narrow and all the advertising inside the cabin reminds me of a bus not an airline.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Cochin. I had a very awkward experience with AirAsia. My booking was confirmed directly by the service agent of AirAsia. When I reached to counter I was told that the flight was overbooked. I then had to keep on begging the lady at the counter for an hour to let me fly. When I asked the executive at the counter to call the manager, she said now you can travel and I could fly, I just had to simply waste my 1 hour time at the counter with no reason.",1
"Flew Cebu Pacific from Manila to Bacolod. Staff not helpful at all! Flew from Manila to Bacolod and while I was checking in the staff didnt say anything that I need to check in the baggage. The staff said it was okay not to check the bags. I only had one suitcase and one backpack. They weighed 9.8kg altogether. So, after the check in I headed over to the security check area only to be stopped by the other staff telling me they needed to check the weight of my bag because I had 2 pieces of carry on baggage. When they weighed it, they said I needed to check in the suitcase and led me to the counter. I didnt have any idea that I needed to pay. For 2.8 kg excess they let me pay 800php just because I had 2 bags with me. I was annoyed because I wasnt informed ahead of time. This airline mostly has cheaper flights but you only get what you pay for. Staff not helpful at all of giving you other options. They are only after what they can benefit from.",1
"Queenstown to Melbourne. In my 40 years of travel this was the absolute worst service ever encountered. As a result of a minor problem with Australian visa and Jetstar refusal to assist, we missed the first leg of international flights and had to re-book. This resulted in spending two nights on airport floors, loss of a paid hotel accomodation, and re-booking fees. The visa was a very minor issue, and a competing airline a few feet away took care of the matter for us in a matter of minutes after Jetstar refusal. Unfortunately, Jetstar had closed the boarding gate and we missed the flight. The counter personnel at the Queenstown airport were extemely rude. In addition, the Jetstar website is very confusing. At the time of purchasing tickets one month in advance, I paid $50 luggage fees. At the time of boarding, we were charged $420 additional fees for two pieces of luggage. The fees were paid and at the next stop in Auckland enroute to Melbourne, the agent attempted to collect additional luggage fees. Again, the personnel were extemely rude and required receipts for the previous payment because the computer didn't contain records. We contested these charges after returning home, but received only long-winded explanations as to why Jetstar bore no responsiblity. This is the absolute worst airline and the most expensive of all the flights due to luggage fees, re-booking, lost hotel charges.",1
As a low-cost airline AirAsia has no entertainment and food or drink should be paid on the flight. I found the leg space insufficient for a person who is 510 or more. I hope AirAsia provides better services to customers in the near future.,1
"Flights were 30 minutes late in both directions, boarding chaotic on both flights. Cabin baggage policy enforced severely on both sectors - ground and air personnel were polite. Baggage information at SYD on the return was non existent but may be SYD in general as the airport is vastly oversubscribed. Overall they did what it said on the ticket but was not a pleasant experience and had we had other timing options I wouldn't use them again",1
Hobart-Sydney on the evening service. Check-in was quick and easy. Was offered exit row seating (at no extra charge) and accepted gladly. This makes a huge difference. Seats are not the most comfortable but what can one realistically expect on a budget airline? Departed slightly early and arrived earlier. Baggage was on the carousel when we got to it. Ground and cabin crew were delightful.,0
"I sought to change my return dates a few times prior to flying. Went on to ""manage booking"" but the webpage led to had ""internal server error"". This was despite several attempts during the few weeks leading up to my flight. At the actual Scoot counter in the airport I was referred to a staff who unconcernedly insisted that all flight changes needed to be done via the call centre. I had to quickly call before to change, and Scoot's call centre had a lot of disrupting options before I was put through. Finally I got the change. If your ""manage booking"" page is down, kindly be upfront and notify customers to call your line first. Secondly, do fix that page. I had much better airline service in Africa when some flight changes were needed, compared to what I got from Scoot.",1
"Jetstar website said if they have changed their confirmed delay time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, they don't notify us unnecessarily of a potential flight delay that can be brought back on to schedule or does not eventuate.They have failed their guarantee. The flight arrival time was changed without any notification. If I didn't go online to check. I won't know. They change the arrival time but not departure time. I feel like I got tricked. I was planning to catch another connection flight, but I couldn't make it. It is meant to depart at 7am, but till 7am, we are not even boarding. If Jetstar notified us earlier, we could have got another flight. They are so unfriendly too. I called the hotline and they said I can move to an earlier, but when I arrived, they said it is full. Also, the airport staff is very rude and unfriendly. I feel like treated second class just because I am flying economy. The flight attendants are the worst. Please never ever ever fly with them. Totally disappointed. Everyone is waiting at the gate, but there is no staff around trying to help us out.",1
"My son, active duty military, had a connection in LAX to go back to Japan where he is stationed. His connection landed 2 hours prior to his flight on ZIPAIR, he was informed his bag had to be re-checked at their counter prior to going through customs to board his flight. There was no agent at the counter to check his bag or father his required documents, check him in and provide a boarding pass. After multiple conversations with airport help desks and ZIPAIR customer service we ultimately had to book a flight on a different airline in order to get him back to Japan timely. Now we are just hoping that he is able to get a refund from ZIPAIR. I would not recommend using them for any flight but if you do be prepared for pricy inconveniences and no customer service. If I could rate them a 0 I would",1
Poor trip with Jetstar will be happy if I never travel with them again. Our direct flight was cancelled Sydney to Phuket and we were then sent through Sydney-Melbourne-Phuket meaning an extra few hours before we even left Australia. Once on board our Melbourne Phuket plane the seats were quite comfortable. Meal times were different we had paid and pre-ordered meals but no they had no record of that even though it was printed on our ticket. This meant we had no meals as only those prepaid and recorded were put on board. We could then purchase a toasted sandwich or pie most uninteresting and unsatisfying. The staff were less than helpful daughter had an infant and was not offered a spare cushion or any other help.,1
"I have flown with Cebu Pacific at least 10 times (that was 10 times too many). They are rarely on-time. Flights are frequently cancelled, mostly delayed by several hours, often re-routed. In my last case, all of the above. Initial flight from Davao to Singapore was cancelled. Rescheduled flight was delayed and then re-routed. Ironically, my perception of the airline is so low, I was relieved I arrived at my final destination only 4-hours late. If you have lots of time and patience and no connecting flight, they are ok. Otherwise, avoid. The money saved is not worth it.",1
"Very disappointed with AA services! Flight delayed for 3 hours and only announced when all passengers are at the gate! Would highly appreciate a text message indicating flight delay schedule! Flight is 5.25am. I have been here since 4am+, entered immigration only to find out flight is delayed! Ridiculous! Kindly work on ur updates and prior inform your passengers. When you think its not necessary to inform ahead, know that it is!",1
"Our flight was for oct 5 2020. sept 19th 2020 Cebu air canceled out fights due too covid. 19 We have been waiting for our refund for over a month now. They tell us it could take 5 billing cycles. They confirmed too me I may have to wait till feb or march of 2021. This is not acceptable, they took my money with no trouble.  With all due respect the handling of this matter concern's me and I will do my best too fly with another company. I had a similar situation's with other airlines and got my money back pronto as it should be.  Also I am having trouble getting my insurance money returned from them as well.",1
"Missed international connection because 3.5 hours late. Was supposed to fly at 10.00 am, delayed till 12.00 but actually took off at 13.30 hrs from Langkawi. Arrived Singapore 15.00 instead of 11-30 thats 3.5 hrs late, my connection was 15.10 to Dubai. I left a gap of 3 plus hours for delays but obviously not enough. So cost me a fortune for onwards flight to Dubai and UK. So unreliable only realised when talking to other passengers its a common theme. lengthy delays and no show aircraft. Big mistake, will certainly not fly again with this airline.",1
"Scoot insisted on measuring the weight of my personal bag and the luggage, and they did not care how much you are over the 10kg limit, a fine of close to US$150. Squeezing every penny out of their customers. Would never fly them again.",1
Travelled from SIN-OOL 2 days ago on a 777 and were not impressed. The seats were very hard and had no head rest! The cabin service was almost non existent and the food was inedible. The water is $4 for a 330ml bottle which is outrageous. The call buttons kept going off all night. However planes are new and clean.,1
I booked a return ticket from Adelaide to Sydney. Flight delayed nine hours. Check in took two hours and the staff were rude and unprofessional (one was even eating lunch while checking people in). Plane was not cleaned before departure - the dirtiest plane I've seen. Then the flight attendant failed to notice that the pax in front of me had his seat reclined before departure was left there for take off and for landing. No apologies - nothing. Never again. Very disappointing.,1
"On a family holiday in Australia we chose Jetstar to fly from Sydney to Cairns. On arriving at Sydney T2 we found that we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the scheduled 15.20 departure. This meant trying to find somewhere to sit in a heavily overcrowded departure lounge while guarding our luggage. The preferred method of checking in seemed to be using one of a row of machines which very efficiently printed our boarding cards and luggage labels. But when we went to the ""Bag Drop"" we were told to wait at the back of the queue. I'm still not sure if everybody in front of us had already checked in at the machine or not. The Jetstar staff member at check-in weighed our 4 hold cases. We'd paid for four x 20 kgs, but all of them only came to 70 kgs. We knew we were allowed 7 kgs per person for hand luggage. When we were asked to redistribute 2 kgs. weight from one case into other pieces of hand luggage which were underweight, we were shocked. We were 10 kgs under on hold baggage! A little common sense would show that we'd already paid more than enough for extra luggage. We'd flown Tigerair from Melbourne to Sydney and their luggage policy seemed far more reasonable - same weight restrictions but as long as the total does not exceed your limit it doesn't matter how it is distributed. Onboard we had serious problems with fellow passengers. We were seated together 27C my wife, 27D myself, 27E my daughter's boyfriend and 27F my daughter. There were 7 men aged 28-35ish seated 25C,D,E,F and 26D,E and F. They were very boisterous from the start, shouting and swearing at each other. Then they ordered beers repeatedly until one of the attendants refused to serve them more alcohol. They became more rowdy and then the one in 26F dropped a can of beer which rolled against my daughter's handbag. When she drew his attention to this they rounded on her giving her ""the finger"". I told them to be careful and they called me a ""rat"". The attendant came and asked them to calm down but it was having no effect. The ringleader appeared to be in 25F. He pressed the call button and told the attendant that I was annoying him by ""reading too loud"" he could ""hear my thoughts"". He looked at me and put his forked fingers to his eyes and then pointed them at me, in true Hollywood gangster style! I felt threatened and concerned for my family's well being. I was worried that they'd all come up to us at the baggage claim. As it happened the only thing was that 25F ran past and bumped into my arm on purpose. I feel the cabin crew allowed this situation to escalate. The entire rear of the plane had to put up with this childish behaviour for three hours. They even shouted at infants to 'Shush"". The staff should have threatened them with calling ahead to Cairns Airport Police to be waiting. This may have served to quieten them down.  Why can't Jetstar allow check-in earlier than 2 hours? I know I have done it with other airlines and it cuts down the queuing tremendously. Why don't Jetstar adopt a total weight luggage policy and show clearly if baggage drop is operational? Why didn't Jetstar cabin crew take sterner action with these 7 troublemakers?",1
Melbourne-Cairns return. Flight to Cairns departed reasonably late. Both flights just average. Service okay and reasonably friendly but nothing great. Planes clean. If you get a cheap airfare then I would recommend flying with them but there are other domestic airlines who are better service wise.,0
Booked flight Singapore-Sydney with seat reservation turned up over 2 hours before departure but flight was overbooked. About 30 people couldn't get on the plane (even though most had paid for their seat reservation). Compensation? Nothing. Nobody from Scoot turned up to announce it or help out (staff of Changi airport were helpful though). On the way back the flight was delayed by over 5 hours. Both flights were unacceptable!,1
"Singapore to Sapporo via Taipei. This is the worst Airline in terms of service level at the ticketing and pre-boarding service. It is the most opportunistic airline that charges absurdly for the slightest change. I kept getting cut-off in my attempt to call and under the pretext or excuse that the manager's name dealing with my case has to be kept a secret, I could never identify the person whom I am supposed to talk to. Scoot had allowed me to change the passenger for the air ticket that I bought for my daughter. But due to unforeseen circumstances, she cannot join us in our family trip. I had to transfer the ticket to my niece. However, during the several telephone conversation, I have been told that the change fee is between S$80-S$100. However, when I tried to make the change online, I was told it would cost me $400, almost the price of the ticket itself! Plus there would also be a fare difference charge when there is no fare change, no change in date or time or selling away my existing ticket and rebuying another! The $400 change fee comprises S$100 for change of first name, another $100 for change of last name, multiply that by 2 for the return ticket! This is the most absurd charge and the airline refused to budge telling me its in their rule!. Firstly, the rule is absurd and secondly, during all the telephone exchanges, I have only been told it is between S$80-$100 and never $400! The discussion has been going on for 2 weeks now, but there has been no resolution. I feel that I have been held to ransom as I am due to depart in slightly more than a week. I have been using Scoot alot recently. But customer service, goodwill and ethical practice obviously has no place in Scoot's management! I will think doubly hard about ever using Scoot again. I had expected that its afiliation to SIA would count in ensuring a certain service level! I also thought my being a Krysfliier member would also be factored in their dealing of this matter. But obviously it does not!",1
Singapore to Sydney. It is a good practice to always check the flight status online on the airport website regardless of which airlines you are flying with. It gives you the most recently updated flight details including any retimed instead of relying on the details provided in your booking reference. My flight with Scoot had been delayed for 45 mins but it didnt bother me due to the fact that I had obtained this info online before I travelled to the airport.,0
"I flew IndiGo from Kolkata to Delhi on 28th September 2015. Flight departed on time, it was good legroom and aircraft clean. The cabin crew were polite and efficient. Arrived on time at midnight. Overall, IndiGo is a reasonably good airline.",0
"This is the worst airline I have ever had dealings with. Many years ago I had booked and paid $130.00 for a flight from Gold Coast to Sydney. On the way to the airport I was held up by road-works, however I arrived at the airport at 4minutes to 3 oclock. There was no one at the checkin counter so I had to wait about 6 minutes before an airline employee came to attend the counter. When he found out that I was booked on the 3-30 flight he informed me that I would not be able to board the flight even though the flight had not been called and I had no baggage whatsoever. He told me I could take the next flight if paid a new fare of $150,00. He informed that I had lost my money. I returned home and the next day I flew out on Virgin Blue from Brisbane Airport. No money was ever refunded even though it is illegal for airlines to retain the airport taxes. I thought that this firm may have improved, and it was convenient I booked a flight from Gold Coast last Friday 13th of May. I noted that the employees were all very dictatorial, but it seemed OK. The flight departed about 12 minutes late and so it also arrived in Sydney late. The flight time to Sydney was 1hour and 7 minutes. After landing the plane commenced travelling to the terminal, but then stopped. After this it did move a few times. The pilot eventually informed us that there was another plane at our gate refuelling. After 1hour and 37 minutes of sitting on the ground the aircraft arrived at the gate. That is flight time was 1hour and 7 minutes and time spent freezing on the taxiway was 1 hour 37 minutes. On last Monday 16th May we began our return journey being booked on a flight departing Sydney at 6-40pm. Everything went to plan until just before departure, passengers were already entering the aircraft, when 3 airline staff came to weigh our tiny bags. They found that our bags (including our wallets) exceeded their weight limit of 7kg by about 2.1kg. We were 2 passengers so the total weight was 16.1kg. They demanded that we pay $65 each even though one passengers bag was less than 7kg. Eventually I removed my toothbrush and pyjamas to get the total weight down to 13.9kg.",1
"Embarrassing to be an Aussie associated with this atrocious brand. Crew came late, pilot came late, plane landed late, luggage came out 40 mins after plane landed. Crew standing around laughing and on their phones. This is not unique but seems to be repeated as the same has happened on my last few journeys with Jetstar. Incompetent bunch with likely poor leadership and an even worse culture.",1
"Booked a flight with Jetstar as they were more than half the price of other airlines. Have a previous flight before I get on the Jetstar flight with 45kg of luggage + 7kg hand luggage. Paid up to the 40kg limit for checked luggage with Jetstar and as advertised on their website, you can add an extra hand luggage. Was told I cannot do that as its already all booked out for the flight, despite when I go in to book the exact same flight, its allowing me to add extra hand luggage (so clearly not sold out as theyre saying). Cant refund the flight I already have to swap it for a new booking. So now I have extra 5kg of luggage that Im going to get charged a fortune for at the airport that I was willing to pre pay for. Absolute scam.",1
The return leg of our flight. Another flight change made without notification we only became aware of it when checking an earlier flight. Had we not done so we would have been unaware of the change. We were re scheduled to Scoot TR 307 some 6 hours later as a consequence we were faced with an 18 hour layover in Singapore which wasnt what we wanted or needed. Queries to Scoot about the changes and lack of notification are ignored they dont respond to customer enquiries. The boarding at Ho Chi Minh was confusing there was an unannounced gate change and the flight dissapeared from the nominated gate. It was not until I confronted staff at the new gate that an announcement was made advising the gate change. The process of boarding was even more confusing a free for all in fact. The boarding gate staff canot provide explanations or advice on ticketing matters. There is no onsite representative.,1
"Auckland to Sydney. I had the worst service at the counter, staff tone to me was as of a robot. I was talked down to and disrespected. Will never fly Jetstar again and will refer everyone away from using it",1
Travelled from Gold Coast - Cairns on Sat 18/10/2014 with walk on bags no charge. Returned on Wed 22/10/2014 with walk on bags as same as gold Coast - extra charge $50.,1
"Jakarta to Bali. The original flight I booked was changed, and the new flight allocated to me was no good because I would have missed my international flight. So I contacted AirAsia via the online chat option, and my flight was changed to my preference easily and quickly. Try doing that with Qantas. Many hours later! I arrived for my flight, it was on time, and comfortable. First time I've flown AirAsia, I've heard that they don't have the best name, but I couldn't fault them. From all the staff I met, to the online chat, to the flight, and arriving on time. Thank you AirAsia.",0
"According their check in process, they mentioned we able start online check 14 days before departure. However, in reality is 10 days before. They should make the correction. Flight return from Krabi to Kuala Lumpur, most of the inflight meal was sold out. Cabin crew mentioned only left  Nasi Lemak option. When they make this announcement flight already on sky of Selangor. I dont know what the purpose they make announcement of food sold out when the flight prepare for landing. They should bring more food since they notice no restaurant operate in international terminal. A320 Neo seat is suck. Not comfortable.",1
"Non-stop delays! Delay over delay over delay. My flight was 4hrs delayed, but they keep on adjusting the time whenever etd comes close. They could have set a particular time and follow through on that. Might as well they give 4hrs so why not set a given time they can follow. Unprofessional!",1
"I flew with AirAsia 6 timea this past 2 weeks, not a single flight was on time. There was zero courtesy shown by staff to the peaple they are delaying. The airline showed zero responsibility towards people with connecting flights on the same airline or other airlines. I hated every minute with them. All this while forgetting it was not really a budget choice nor was there any added value for the cost.",1
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. It was my latest worst experience with AirAsia. During check-in, baggage check-in was quite fast. In the new airport, it was comfortable and many lanes that open for passengers to check-in. However, the flight got delayed for an hour and additional another hour. AirAsia which know for its time accuracy got hit really bad with this one.",1
"Very rude male flight attendant. Accessed the rear toilet onboard after being ushered in by a female fight attendant. Upon starting to use the toilet (after about 15 seconds) there was a very load banging on the door. As I started to stop proceedings and get presentable the banging noise increased and so I rushed to get out asap. As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable. Extremely poor passenger consideration.",1
"I'm absolutely appalled Jetstar is not willing to issue a refund for our flight. We're currently required to shelter in place for our own safety during this world pandemic. Not to mention many of the international borders are closed and we're unable to fly. Yes, we're all affected by this pandemic, and I understand the airline industry is hurting, but don't attempt to profit off of your customers who aren't even able to utilize your services. Issuing your customers a voucher that expires within 6 months is not acceptable. It's not like we can just put our life on pause and travel whenever we wish. These trips take a ton of planning and coordination to pull off, and the fact Jetstar is unwilling to empathize with their customers during this difficult time is a perfect example of the kind of company that puts ethics to the side in order to benefit themselves for the short-term. Disgusting.",1
Following the below review of our trip from Tokyo-Sapporo the return flight Sapporo-Tokyo was cancelled leaving us with the option of travelling the following day or getting a refund. To give a refund is to shirk responsibility. Anyway I suppose low-cost travel is fine provided nothing goes wrong. If it does you're completely stuck at a foreign airport. Overall the cheap experience from beginning to end is probably not worth it unless you're desperate to save $50 on the ticket price at the purchase stage. We will certainly not be using low-cost air travel again if it can possibly be helped.,1
"Melbourne to Sydney. As advertised each person allowed to carry 7 kg of luggage. However at the gates, rude and unprofessional gate keeper pick 3 of us and send us back to pay extra luggage. They have another guy at the back to process the payment of extra luggage. This guy just make random decision to charge 2 of us $195 for extra luggage fee. Each of us carry 12kg of luggage which we explain that it is our kids luggage as it is impossible to get the kids to carry even 5kg of item themselves. They don't bother to listen to us and force us to pay the fee saying that if we argue, they'll leave us and we won't able to fly. The guy blamed me for not processing the luggage as a group which is incorrect. He also said that he only work here and if other staff sent us back to him, his job is to charge us. I explained that we come in a group and the guy who sent us back processed us together. He told me to submit complaint to customer service (which I already suspect will only waste my time). We can confirm that all of us are not exceeding the baggage allowance and it even fall below it. For a record, we also come early before the gate even opened. I tried to talk to the guy but he just play dumb and told us to go away. So I tried to complaint and explain to customer service online. And as expected, I chat with a human robot who only able to follow protocol which clearly designed to care, listen and treat customer fairly.  In the end of the day only monkey take peanuts and you get what you pay. However in this case the monkey is not only give you bad customer service but also rob you. To me, its not about the $ but I hate this kind of dodgy treatment.",1
"CGK-DEN-CGK. CGK-DEN delayed by 2 hours to 11am due to technical problems so Lion Air gave a lunch box - not bad but not appetizing. I went to the Manager on Duty to ask for an earlier flight on another airline (as I was planning to return the same day) but they couldn't find a seat on another airline. When I reminded her that Garuda had a flight leaving soon she said she didn't check with Garuda. They were definitely overwhelmed with complaints. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I've ever been on. I'm only 171cm (5'7"") but my knees touched the seat in front of me. No service onboard not even a glass of water or anybody going around the cabin selling anything. If they dont improve the service I wont use them anymore.",1
"5 flight cancellations! No refund issued but credit vouchers which were unwanted. I've been on live chat, telephone, and email without resolution so far. We booked a flight in good faith, we tried to rebook but the company kept cancelling and are not issuing refunds.",1
DRW-SIN. I was sceptical at first but was presently surprised. Check in took some time but I was offered an exit seat without asking and being 6'5 this was very welcome. Staff were friendly plane was generally clean and ok seats weren't great but ok for a 4hr flight. Was a bit annoyed I had to pay for food but it wasn't that expensive and was good quality. Hired an iPad for $12AUD too which had plenty of stuff on to watch. Returning with them in a few weeks and look forward to it.,0
I lost hand baggage which was essentially checked in baggage from Bangalore to Mumbai. The staff did not allow me check in two cabin bags as per indigos one piece policy and lost my bag. I coordinated with Bangalore Airport lost and found department for 3 days and managed to locate my bag.,1
"My friend and I were travelling to Vietnam. We were trying to be cautious and followed Smart Traveller (official governement information published in regards the safety of the traveller) which clearly indicated not to travel and decided not to risk our health and request a voucher. But the problem is that we can't use our vouchers in the future as I am no longer there and my friend will be leaving very soon. So, a voucher doesn't make sense. And we don't want a voucher. We need our money back. We have explained them several times. It is a real shame how they have treated us (my friend, really) on the phone, trying to make us look like fools, trying to make us finish their endless calls with hours put on hold, telling us they would call us back and didn't do it.  We are never again using Jetstar.",1
I paid 150usd for a ticket from Danang to Kuala Lumpur but ended up paying another 150usd because they said I chose the wrong baggage type. They have the worst customer service!,1
"Avoid Air Asia at all cost. They cancelled our tickets MNL-DPS-MNL, with less than a month's notice. No other flights to or from Denpasar were available - seems to me like they have stopped flying this route. Obviously, we then had to pay twice as much to repurchase tickets so close to the departure date, and so far, 3 weeks later, we have seen no sign of an Air Asia reimbursement. This company, it turns out, is in significant financial distress (PN17 status in Malaysia), so this must be a symptom of that. Don't risk losing your money with them - Air Asia seems to have gone from hero to zero, unfortunately.",1
Not as good as full service carriers but compared to other budget airlines it is amazing. Nice seats clean aircraft very helpful and friendly flight attendants. Cheaper and better than other budget carriers like Air Asia.,0
"My wife recently had heart surgery and could therefore not walk fast enough. Because being Filipina she has to queue on a different passport control line. I, therefore, arrived at the gate earlier. When making the staff aware of my wife's heart problem and her not being able to walk fast, they asked me ""why would we care?"" When turning around to sit back down after this interaction, one of your employees spoke in Tagalog to the others and all laughed. Is this the service one can expect from Cebu Pacific? What kind of airline is this? What do they write in their hiring add ""Searching for the most unqualified, most useless person available. Not liking to interact with people, and not having the appropriate manners for that matter, is mandatory""?",1
At check in I was told that I am not able to take my cabin baggage as the aircraft is small. While boarding I found that everybody is carrying hand luggage except me. Then I found that carrier is normal A320 with sufficient luggage space.,1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Jetstar is by far the worst airline that I have ever flown with. Extremely unprofessional and rude ground staff, long delays, very bad organisation, dirty planes. Dont ever waste your time and money flying with this airline.",1
Bangalore to Singapore. Horrible experience with check in staff at Bangalore. We had an onward flight from Singapore to Jakarta on Singapore Airlines. The check in staff refused to check us in saying we did not have Singapore visas. We explained that we were transiting at Singapore so did not need a visa. They refused to accept. I explained that at Singapore it is possible to freely transfer between terminals T2 & T3 without needing to pass Immigration. They refused to agree and insisted we required a Singapore visa. After much discussion they allowed us to board after they realized we possessed valid US & other visas. Wereached Singapore and there is no requirement to pass Immigration. Imagine if we did not possess other visas- would we have not been allowed to travel. Sad to see the poor quality of ground staff at Indigo.,1
"Firstly to appreciate the ambiance of the plane was classy and good, it was a noon flight and expected to have something on flight. I called to the air hostess and asked her for something to eat as she was serving and asking a few people what they want, but she said the sales will start in sometime and that I can take them. I also wanted to take some goodies of indigo cookies and nuts for my daughter but no one was bothered to serve.",1
"Singapore to Jakarta on board Boeing 737-900ER. The check in process is smooth and the staff is kind. The cabin crew was nice. However, The flight was delayed for around more than 45 minutes due to late arrival of aircraft from Jakarta. Overall, it is good journey with Lion Air despite the delay.",0
"Bangkok to Hat Yai, its a cheap and low cost airline, I have to say the ground staff and the cabin crew was every time really polite and friendly. Of course there are not many amenities or complimentary services but for the price I paid, the only thing which should be improved is the legroom space, this was really narrow, but this was ok for a two hours flight.",0
Sydney to Melbourne. This was one of the worst airline experiences I had for such a short distance. The problem is the outrageous penalty system built in fare system. Apparently they have 7 kg in cabin limit. Anyways I could check in my baggage for free but apparently if I bring it on board they charge it.  I had a back pack which is 8.1 kg while boarding they decide to weigh bags on board. They charged me$60. Look if I had to pay the same price checking in my bag I would not mind. But this is clearly a bad customer policy especially designed to exploit busy people like me who have no time to read fine print.  The ground personal was not helpful either. They were on a tight leash.,1
We travelled to Tokyo on 2nd October from Singapore with a transit at Taipei. This is our second time travelling with Scoot and both times we were quite happy with the airline. It is a budget airline and it delivers exactly what it promises. The seats are by far the most comfortable of all budget airlines that we have used and the food quite decent and not exorbitant. I had not pre-booked a meal reading reviews that food is bad but when we ordered on board we found it quite good. One tip would be to order sandwiches or food that does not need to be heated. The transit at Taipei was smooth and we reached Narita on the dot. Only reason I have not given it full marks is that we had pre-booked iPad for my daughter and the stewardess first said they had none that were working. When I insisted on the fact that we had already booked and they should refund our money she promptly brought the iPad to us. But it was a small point in an overall good journey. Scoot remains our first choice in budget airlines.,0
"My flight from Melbourne to Cebu was delayed by 15 hours last January 2023. So, I missed by mothers surprised birthday celebration. I tried to claim for damages, but Scoots customer service just passed me to their insurer,. Scoots customer service wasnt helpful, it felt like you were talking to robots from the other side. After I submitted my claim to their insurer, it took weeks before they responded. And every time they respond, they would keep asking the same set of documents which I already submitted. So approximately 4 months now and I havent received anything from them. Sometimes it is better to pay for a full-service flight which is a little bit expensive but with better service (after sales service) than budget airlines like Scoot.",1
"I book premium flatbed to and from KUL-Taipei, I spent over RM8000 for my wife and my tickets. We leave KUL on Christmas eve. The flight have been delayed first from 10 am to 1:30 and the gate was changed from one site of the large airport to the other side of the airport, we are asked to checked in but was usher to another room for more waiting. The flight finally left around 2:30-3:00 Pm for Taipei. At least we still have the flatbed seat we book to relax on the flight. Later on the return trip, the flight was delayed, and during checked in I realised the seat number are not consistent with my booking, so i asked the ground crew about it and was told not to worry as i still have my seat I booked .. it is a lie. We were shocked when we walk into the cabin as the configuration of the plane is different from our booking. there are no flatbed on this plane, up until now, no one have the decency to let me know about this changes. Later during the flight I asked one of the stewardess how to request for a refund for my premium flatbed booking and was told i need to make an online feedback on their website. I make the feedback after on the 3rd day after returning to KL and I didn't receive any email or message reply. last i check i have a RM400+ credit in my account which i assume is from that flight but i am not sure as i never received any response. This is a lousy way to treat your customer. I make a vow to myself not to ever fly AirAsia again.",1
"If you have plenty of time and patience then go for Cebu Pacific, otherwise I wouldn't recommend them to anybody. Our flight was 2.5 hours late so we missed our next flight even though we originally would have 3.5 hours between transit. There was almost no information given in the airport and the staff told os both in Puerta Princesa and in Manila that they would contact our connecting flight, which they never did. Staff was not helpful at all in the airport when we needled to quickly be transported from terminal 3 to 1. We heard from many other travelers that this is normal and that they frequently cancel flight if the planes don't get filled up. You get what you pay for.",1
For the first time my husband and I travelled with Indigo airlines 2 days ago and were very sceptical as it was a budget airline and we had slightly excess baggage. To our surprise from our very first contact with the Indigo airline staff to the end of our trip we were impressed. The lovely young lady at Mumbai airport greeted us with pleasantries checked in our luggage which was a bit above the limit. Once on board on our flight to Singapore we found the seats spacious and comfortable the crew courteous and professional. The inflight service was excellent and reasonably priced. We purchased some spiced chai and cookies that came beautifully packaged in a tin. Regular announcements by the crew were clear and polite. Would gladly travel Indigo Airlines again and highly recommend it.,0
"Manila to Taiwan return, they issue a travel ban on February 10 so were not able to use the ticket. I checked on their web site that its either I call the hotline or go to the nearest Cebu pacific branch. What I did is I went to their branch in Puerto Princesa to asked for the travel fund their staff has no knowledge about what to do on travel fund they gave me incomplete requirements needed for the refund. I specifically asked them what are the documents needed and the other staff told me just 2 government identification but only to find out that I still need an authorization letter from my sister. Ive been coming back many times because the supervisor whose supposed to do the refund is not around (because shes the only authorize to do it according to them) .. it took 11 hours for the travel fund to finished.. They are very incompetent.",1
Avoid at all costs! They cancelled my flight and put me on one that didn't work so requested a refund end of March 2022 and it is now April 2023 and still not received! They dont answer you or when they do its the usual your refund is being processed! This company is nothing but glorified thieves! Avoid.,1
"Gold Coast To Sydney. A delay of 2 hours because of an engineering problem that had no time limit until it was fixed. Once boarding finished, it was a quick getaway to make up some time. Inflight service and IFE was non existent, Jetstar is a LCC. We landed 2 hours late, so no time was made up during the flight time. I would advise anyone flying on LCC to just be cautious if you are on a schedule, otherwise delays happen and you will eventually arrive at your destination.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong. Traveling on Air Asia back home on Christmas day. KLIA2 was orderly, not too much that mad rush. Experience with the Premium Flex had been most positive, from check in to arrival. Plane slightly delayed by 30 minutes, which was minor. A surprising light load, with many empty seats, I had all 3 hot seats of row 3 to myself! Therefore, service is quicker and crew very courteous. The chicken rice was delicious. Rest of the flight was uneventful and relaxing. Overall, it's worth to pay that little extra on Air Asia.",0
"Miri to Kota Kinabalu by AirAsia. Booking and Check In were easy. Flight departed and arrived on time. Since it was less than an hour flight, flight attendants did not really sell a food on board, meanwhile i really wanted to order. they only served passenger with prebooked meal. However, definitely i will fly AirAsia again.",0
Delhi to Bangalore. Its very convenient to travel from Delhi airport to any city as its the only airport having wide range of connectivity. The staff is very helpful. I like the way they are providing services to senior citizens with full respect.,0
"Dubai to Manila. I fly on Cebu Pacific often, intl and domestic flights. I know very well it is a budget airline so my expectations are adequate. Out of 20 flights, 19 were on time and 1 was heavily late but luckily it did not disrupt our journey too much. They offered a voucher for free flight that we could use for an really expensive segment of our next trip. In the case of advance schedule change, Cebu gave us opportunity to adjust our flights, everything was smooth and professional. Most of our long-haul flights were landing ahead of time so we even took the risk to book a connecting flight DXB-MNL-IAO with only 1 hour for transfer between intl and domestic terminal in Manila and it worked perfectly.",0
"Melbourne to Vientiane via Kuala Lumpur. I went in circles with the Ava online chat to attempt refunds for 4 flights I had booked over March/ April. My flight was cancelled the day before but luckily I had already decided to change the flight. I had an option for a full refund for this flights and after attempting several times through Ava, I was finally able to make a case. I made 5 cases before I received a notification that it's in progress. My other flights cancelled by Air Asia in April however, do not have a refund option. Only credit or moving the date which I do not want. If the flight has been cancelled, I expect a full refund. At this time, I can't even use Ava as the wait time is over 1 hr to be transferred to an agent. The website, Ava and phone numbers that lead nowhere have taken me in circles for weeks and I'm furious that there is no accountability to customers.",1
Morning Flight from Singapore to Chennai. Arrived at check in three hours early and had no checked in baggage so check in was smooth and quick. Boarding was also very quick and professional. Upon boarding I changed my seat from where I was sitting in the front to the seats just in front of the emergency seats near the wing as it was empty. I believe Indigo keeps these seats reserved as you can pay on board to upgrade these seats but no one bothered me for moving to these seats. Slept throughout the flight and overall flight was comfortable and very clean. No IFE or food but this was a short flight so not bothered at all about it would recommend in future.,0
"Singapore to Athens. While Scoot economy is quite good value for money, the biz section is totally the opposite. Besides the friendly crew and larger but uncomfortable seat, the rest was not there. Food and drinks are very limited and below par to any comparison. My WiFi and entertainment didn't work on both directions. ""Sorry about this"" was the reply when brought up to flight crew. Someone behind me gave them a 30 mins earful regarding same issues so I opted not to do the same and honor their politeness with just mentioning my concerns. Overhaul, Scoot biz not worth it. I would get better outcome on premium economy somewhere else. Their economy is not bad considering the price range.",1
"Jaipur to Lucknow. I got what was expected and that was low cost flying, and the flight was on time and that's what really matters. The crew was courteous and overall an average flight experience however some seat covers were torn. I hope they clean their aircraft before flights.",1
"Traveling with IndiGo on our recent family trip from HYD to DFW via DOH proved to be a frustrating experience that left us feeling helpless and disappointed. During our check-in at HYD, IndiGo's system was down, leading to 7 out of our 13 total checked-in bags being manually tagged. Though we understood that technical issues can happen, what followed was a series of missteps. Upon arrival at DFW, we discovered that all 7 manually tagged bags were missing. The Qatar Airways team at DFW had no information about these manually generated tags, leaving us stranded without vital belongings. We called IndiGo's customer care 9 times over three days, and each time, the response was the same: unable to reach the Hyderabad crew, and no managers on the call center floor to escalate our issue. The lack of responsiveness and the inability to locate our bags with crucial manual tags felt like a major oversight. What added to our frustration was that 5 of the 7 manual tags were taken back by the IndiGo team when their system came back online, leaving us without any physical proof. Polite customer care representatives, though unable to assist. Failure in handling manual tag situation during system downtime. While we appreciate that technical issues can occur, it's the handling of such problems that defines a company's reputation.",1
"Scoot Airlines prolonged 26-hour flight delay was extremely inconvenient, and to make matters worse, they failed to provide any accommodation refund or support. Disappointing service.",1
"It is my first time to fly with ZIPAIR and knowing that it was a budget airline i didnt really have high expectations. So when we came in the person on the counter asked us to put all our hand carry luggages all together, there are 3 of us so we should have 21kgs in total. It initially was 28kg all together which was way too much so we had to put the rest of our stuff inside the checked in luggages and then when we reweigh after it was 24kg. She still didnt allow and wants us to remove more stuff so we opened our luggages again in front of the counter and transfered more stuff. I asked if we could just checked in 1 bag but she said since we only paid for 2 checked in luggages we can only check in 2 bags as well. So finally after the 3rd try it was now 20.8kg. Then it was finally time to weigh the 2 checked in luggages. I paid for x2 30kg luggages which in but ours in total was only 38kgs.  I mean cant they be a little bit more lenient with the luggages i know there are policies but it just doesnt make sense to me at all. I just dont understand why they have to be so strict with the hand carry luggages when there were so much weight left with our checked in luggages anyway. And They both go on the same plane? What was weird for me too was that they weighed our hand carry first before the checked in luggages which was a first for me. Ive never experienced this with other airlines.",1
"I had a very rude experience with the flight attendants. I have toddler who kept crying when one of the senior attendants kept asking us to sit on her seat as we are going to land soon. I'm trying to seeking her understanding as we are trying to pacify her, but instead of offering help or give us time she kept saying that the flight will be hold for a while if I didn't manage to put my toddler to sit, she will report to the captain and the whole flight will be delayed because of us. Scoot has teach their crew and attendants airlines to have compassionate and understanding.",1
"Shocking customer service, would like to give 0 of 10 but can't. Changing flights, to add a forced stop over, and wasting a day of our trip without so much as an apology. Trapped in the check in area of Brisbane airport for hours because we had to recheck our bags during the forced stop over but we're then prohibited from checking our bags for hours. Staff show no empathy. Never again!",1
Relocating to New Zealand so had excess luggage. Had called Jetstar twice before travel to check the cost and on both occasions was told $15 per kg. At check-in was charged $25 per kg and was told that $25 per kg is the international excess baggage charge regardless of destination. The excess baggage cost more than the actual flight ticket. Check-in staff could not care less that we were given incorrect information over the phone (twice!). Poor customer service and unethical business practices in my opinion.,1
"Me and my husband are heading off from Perth to Melbourne by Jetstar. I have bought extra legroom for both of us. When we are at counter to enter, I have been asking from stewardess that i need to assist for my seat, then i said no. Suddenly she grab my boarding pass then relocated our seat separately with different seat, separate with my husband. After a little bit argument, they gave me seat side by side then I'm just take the ticket than leave for boarding and the last one who enter the plane. Without apologies from them and not return my money that i bought the extra legroom. I bought $613 for one way, such a wasted money. Never fly JetStar again.",1
"We flew Scoot on the 23 November 2014 Sydney to Singapore and were very happy with the flight and service. The meal provided was OK. Captain had a good sense of humour ""We are going to Scoot off now"". We would defiantly fly Scoot again.",0
For our flight (my husband n me) today evening at 5.45 pm I tried doing web check at about 10 am. I had no option to select a free seat together. Only way to ensure we sit together was if I bought seats - one middle one window or aisle. Cost of middle seat is minimum Rs 90/ and cost of aisle or window seat is minimal Rs 150 or max Rs 350. When I tried to web check in without seat selection message popped up in auto seat allotment- there is no guarantee that we will be seated together. The website gives no option of free seats together to choose.,1
"Booked an expensive flight during Eid weekend. Checked in more than 4 hours before flight only to find out the flight is full. App told me to come to the airport early only to put me on a flight 5 hours earlier than my actual flight. No compensation, nothing. Front desk did not even tell me I would not get on the same flight. Why overbook a flight during a major holiday? Why do customers just get pushed to any flight they want without prior notice nor without compensation? Ive travelled with other budget airlines and this is just the worst. Also, customer service is bad. I cant even file a complaint. Front desk says all complaints need to go through their online chat Ava. Well, Ava is not human and doesnt understand simple keywords like refund and compensation. The worst.",1
"All-in-all an unpleasant experience. Manila to Melbourne. I thought Id done everything to cover the two pieces of luggage I needed to check-in. I admit, it was my mistake (I think) in concluding that the two pieces I pre-paid for online had a weight allowance of 20kg each, when in fact it turned out it was for a total allowance of 20kg. This mistake was made from my experience on other airlines sites that usually either have a straight weight policy, or an individual baggage weight limit. Anyway, I got it wrong, and the penalty for being 6kg over was 6,000 pesos, thats close to 100, two thirds as much as the original fare. Id already paid an extra 3,000ps for a seat with extra legroom. The fare that looked very attractive at the outset had more than doubled. As others have stated, the seats are narrow and uncomfortable, and the food I pre-paid for was bland. There is no in-flight entertainment. If youre flying internally in the Philippines, Cebu Pacific might be a prudent choice, but in future, for international flights, I will certainly be happy to pay a little extra for a more pleasant experience.",1
Dumaguete to Manila. Who is crazy enough to fly them twice? Someone must because they are growing. But I will never ever fly them again! Got to airport 2.5 hours early. Sat past boarding time. About 15 minutes later announced plane was on runway. Over two hours later it arrived. I had another flight leaving Manila for Los Angeles. Talked to Cebu three times. They never offered to do diddly-squat! My phone didnt work there and had no internet! They said there was nothing they could do. Missed flight that left at 6:40pm. Spent the night wandering airports. Finally got a 3:40AM flight out. Will get to LAX tomorrow midday. I have been traveling  24 hours already and have still getting to LAX and then Atlanta!,1
TZ 2 19 June SIN/SYD in Scootbiz. Rubbish the cabin crew disappear they muddle the food and they lack the basic standards. Not impressed at all!,1
Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in DEL-BOM. An efficient airline which prides itself at being on time with helpful air and ground crews. New clean aircraft - just one grouse though a low cost carrier it would be great if the leg space was better. I am about 6 feet tall and it becomes uncomfortable in case of flights which are over an hour or so.,0
Bangkok - Yangon - Bangkok. I bought the ticket on internet. The process was a bit time consuming as I had to click through many pages. The 48 hours web check in was very convenient as I could check in on both flights. But still I had to go to the check-in counter at the airport for document check. Check in at Bangkok was long. I only had a handbag and I was directed to a counter for that purpose. Service was good. I am 1.81 and found the seat spacing adequate. There was a wide variety of food options which could be ordered when the ticket was purchased. Cabin staff professional and friendly on both flights. My only complaint is that on the return flight a PRM (Person with Reduced Mobility) was seated between me and the aisle (I had a window seat). I don't think this is legal and it caused discomfort for the other person.,0
Absolute nightmare is the only way I can describe the situation we found ourselves in upon arriving in Melbourne from Singapore. Our flight to Brisbane was cancelled. Despite warnings I booked return airfares to Singapore. The flights weren't that cheap once you paid for all the add-ons. No food is provided unless you pay for it. In fact you're best to pre-book because the food runs out. Back to Melbourne. Jetstar offered us an alternative flight on Qantas. We wanted to go home early to save us hanging around the airport for hours. We were offered one flight which left later than the one they cancelled. No effort to be conciliatory. Given the fault was theirs they should have made at least some effort to be more helpful. We couldn't check in our luggage because the paperwork wasn't done. We were forced to stay at the airport for 9 hours - only 1 without our bags. Put this one down to experience but can guarantee I'll never fly Jetstar international again.,1
"Gold Coast to Tokyo. Flight was cancelled 2 hours prior to departure due to volcanic activity near Manila. When speaking to customer service they told us they do not have another flight until 7 days later. We had ski resort accomodation/lift passes and train tickets booked which is now lost. Customer service is terrible and they do not care for the customer. Jetstar, youve ruined our holiday.",1
"Launceston to Sydney. Weather was very bad with extreme fog lingering all day meaning that most flights in and out were cancelled. This is not the bit that bothers me because weather is something out of an airlines control. What is in Jetstar's control is rescheduling. Instead of running a flight the next day for us, Jetstar instead tried dumping passengers on pre-existing flights, all of which were booked out until Tuesday! (My flight was supposed to be Sunday). If they had put on another flight on Monday, I would not mind. Customer service at Jetstar is extremely lacking. Would not even offer me a cash refund, instead trying to offer me a voucher! I had to spend hundreds rebooking myself on a Virgin Australia flight the next day in some hope of trying to salvage my hotel booking in Sydney and getting myself onto my International flight a day later.",1
Singapore to Bangkok. Flight was delayed from 10:05pm to 2:30am the next day. I was unable to find out the reasons for this. I think such long delays are unacceptable without detailed explanations. I will probably avoid using this airline in the future!,1
"Will never fly Jetstar again, flights were changed weren't notified we were flying from Perth to Thailand with a stop over in Singapore on way. The flight time was changed we were not notified. Our flight was changed till midnight next night from Perth to Sydney 4hr flight than had wait 8hrs in Sydney than a 9 hr flight to Thailand. Absolute joke worst experience we have had.",1
Adelaide to Sydney . Non professional behaviour from Adelaide staff. Never fly in this airline again. The gate shows last call and they didn't allow me to fly. Strange strange arguments for that. I asked for compensation. Its not my fault that the gate didn't show closed.,1
"Aircraft was delayed 2 hours arriving in Yangon. Slow boarding of bags caused another 30 min delay. The staff never explained the delay, guess it is common. People missed their connections and if they were two separate bookings on AirAsia they would be responsible to buy a new ticket. Ridiculous if you ask me when it was AirAsia's fault they missed a connection. Decent cabin service. But AirAsia's late rate along with them constantly jacking with schedules and moving flights makes me not a fan.",1
Using AirAsia 2 at least twice per month for the last 3 or so years. Majority of the flights were departing on time and many touch down even a few minutes before scheduled arrival With the new KLIA2 facilities AirAsia flights from/to Kuala Lumpur are now so much more enjoyable than before with the carrier operating out of LCCT.,0
I was travelling with my wife and 6 months old baby. While checking in from Cochin the ground staff at the counter gave us seats [19F and 19C] saying its seated together. Later I realised she did a mistake and it should be 19D. I was walking through the airport randomly looking for your staff to sort this issue out and found one of your agents. She looked through it and tried from her end and told me it wont be possible at this time as other seats are already occupied and you can do it on board and there is a lady seated at 19D. I told her my daughter is already tired from the Male flight and its important for us to sit together. She understood our situation and told she will try her best. At time of boarding I explained the same situation to boarding agent. She replied the same saying you should try it on board as nothing she could do it now. There comes the pleasant surprise! This staff member came all the way to our gate which she doesnt have to bother doing at all. She literally looked for the passenger seated at 19D and talked to her and agreed to swap seats with mine. I was very much overwhelmed with her genuine concern towards our issue and how she went well and above to sort this out for us. Please pass my sincere gratitude to her. She deserves it. However on other hand on board it was totally opposite experience. I know its a short flight to CNN but crew didnt make any effort to do the service for this flight. They didnt took the food cart out to the aisle or neither brought the round of water at least. They were just busy in the galley throughout until landing. I never even saw them securing the cabin! When the captain made announcements they went to the seat ready for landing. In contrast on the CNN to COK flight I received full service like any other flight and I was amazed the way they ignored the cabin just like that inspite of full flight.,1
"Wuhan to Singapore. I am very disappointed that since Silkair gave up this route to Scoot, the timing of the flight is terrible and that the price is even more expansive then Silkair, considering Scoot is a budget airline. I wish they could reinstate back to Silkair or at least, use the same flight time slot. Otherwise, I am giving up flying Scoot.",1
I've had two cancellations through covid and of course these lowlifes don't refund. Now trying to use the next to useless credit they've issued and got caught by their awful website where they consider Avalon a Melbourne airport. It's a $150 cab fare so that is not a Melbourne airport. Tried to change this back to Melbourne airport - not possible on their site. Try to chat to them - not possible unless you are flying in under 48 hours. Persisted and got someone who told me no you can't change the airport so I asked if I could cancel. Sorry not protected - you'll lose the tickets. At this point I gave up and rebooked on Virgin - cheaper than these guys with luggage included and none of the website traps they deploy. I have learn't my lesson - never ever again. If you are coming from overseas and plan to use domestic airline services here - this airline makes Ryanair look good.,1
Onboard my seat was musty and dirty. I had already ordered food online and when I received the 'Chef and Crew's choice' dish it was cold and soggy. Thank goodness the price is reasonable or else I would lodge a complaint.,1
"This entire experience has been absolutely appalling, I am utterly stunned at how an airline can be so incompetent, disrespectful to its customers, and downright threatening. Off the bat, within 24 hours both our international Phuket leg and our Sydney to Melbourne legs were cancelled. We were offered no apology, and thankfully, were given a new flight a day later to Phuket in which we lost our reserved seats that we had had booked for months. Not only did the service desk person in Melbourne airport absolutely berate my by the point crying mother, after the airline had already lost our bags, she proceeded to blackmail me into apologising to her for saying that ""Jetstar is run by Qantas so you're wrong"" or else I would not be able fly. On top of this, the manager was completely and utterly disinterested in assisting us. And yes, that's right, the airline also lost our luggage from the Sydney to Melbourne leg and offered us absolutely zero compensation I've never been treated so utterly horrendously not only by an airline but by any company I can possibly think of. I would absolutely, never, ever fly Jetstar ever again. This has been the worst travel experience of my life and has brought me to tears. Jetstar should be ashamed of themselves. You are an embarrassment to the country.",1
"Adelaide to Melbourne. Very disappointed in the service staff at both gate and service desk. After reaching the gate and having my carry on luggage weighed and being over by 3kg, I was told I would need to go and check it in for $60. Back out of the departure lounge I go, passing the security I just waited 20 minutes to go through and to the service desk where I would recite that my carry on baggage is over the designated amount and that I have been told to have it put under the plane. The staff member on the service desk re-weighs my bag and tells me that it doesn't need to go under the plane, I just need to pay $30 for an extra baggage allowance, which I do, and then he puts a tag on my mini suitcase and handbag and we proceed back towards the even larger cue at the security check. At this point I'm a little bit annoyed that I had to walk out and re do this process just to be told that my bag doesn't need to go under the plane, however, I was the one who went over the weight limit so I don't mind. After getting back to the terminal where my plane is boarding I am singled out by the staff member who originally told me I needed to go pay extra to have my bag put under the plane. I tell him that I have just been out to the service desk and already had my baggage sorted. He said no, grabbed my bag from me and put it on the scales. Said that it needed to go under the plane and started telling me callously that he told me this already and that it's my fault- I would have to pay an additional $60 and have it checked in. It had been a long morning and after being sent here and there I was emotional (my anxiety caving in around me) and against my best efforts, started crying. This elicited no sympathy, only a defensive manner of tone from the staff member. I tried telling him again that I had followed his instructions which led me to the service desk who then told me otherwise. Thank God my boyfriend was there to help communicate because I was a mess. The lady who processed the payment was helpful and caring,  in the end instead of charging me $60 on top of the recently paid $30 she only made me pay the difference. It was the lack of communication and knowledge of policy by staff members as a whole, and the rudeness and belittling nature encountered by one staff member in particular that has made me decide I will not be flying with this airline again nor will I be recommending it. They may be cheap flights but you get what you pay for.",1
Flew from Singapore to Sydney on 29/1/13. Check in was slow - one of the ground staff collected our passports and about another 5 people at front of the queue took them back to the counter the person at the counter flipped through the passports put a sticker on the front and then the passports were returned. Yet when our turn came to check in there was no apparent time saving. The check in staff were inappropriately dressed they were indistinguishable from general airport workers. Onboard we had ordered the blanket sets and had to ask 3 times for them although they did apologise when we finally received them. The overhead reading light switches on the arm were very sensitive so that every time you press against the arm the light would come on. The inflight crew were polite and helpful.,1
I quite often travel from Pune to Nagpur and I would always prefer Indigo over other budget airlines. The ground staff and flight crew is humble and helpful and they give you good attention when needed. Flight crew seems well trained and organized compared to crew of other airlines. In-flight food options are good and inexpensive. They serve coffee unlike GoAir. Ticket pricing is better than competition.,0
"Flew on JQ959 from Cairns to Sydney. Many bad things can be told about the bad experience with flying Jetstar (old dirty plane a long delay without any information provided until the scheduled flight time has arrived an attempt to charge for every little thing) but maybe the worst think about Jetstar is the rudeness of the ground crew and the flight attendants. In the case of Jetstar: ""Low cost airline = Low cost crew"". Never again.",1
"AirAsia flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur delayed more than one hour. Gate changed in SIN without prior notice. At check-in we had to print our own baggage tags at machines that were not all working properly. Seats were assigned randomly although we booked tickets as a couple. Cabin crew polite and friendly. Cheap ticket, 60 SGD including checked in baggage.",0
Sector 1 - SIN-TPE in economy. The service and seats are ok but the reading light was not working. It is basically a no frills budget airlines. But comparing to other LCCs Scoot is operating on a bigger airplane and the comfort is substantially better. Sector 2 - TPE-SIN on Scoot BIZ. Decided to upgrade at the counter. Again the reading light was not working. Seat is wider and the recline is better. Food comes with a small main course pringles and a drink. They also offer free streaming videos and games but those who recently upgraded to apple's IOS 7 be warned. It is currently not compatible. Overall I am satisfied with the service provided.,0
JQ3 SYD-HNL on 4th December one way first time international with Jetstar. Had a delay due to a computer issue so for safety reasons we left at 20.30 instead of 18.00. During the delay the flight attendants were not any good as they had put them self in the galley and only came down with a small drink of water which wasn't that nice. The captain was much helpful with information during the delay. After take-off in flight entertainment started but not for long. Didn't have any food or drink as I was sick during the flight except water during the delay. Would recommend it if your looking for the cheapest way possible but at the same time wouldn't recommend it. I would personally keep to domestic with Jetstar.,1
"Cancelled twice when the flight date is near, the last one few hours before scheduled departure, without explanation. 1 hour delayed. Not dependable.",1
They canceled my flight due to Covid-19 and now refuse to give a refund. Besides advertising it on there own website. They only gave me a travel fund which i can use in the next 180 days. Customer Service is not helpful at all and extremely hard to reach. It took me almost 3 weeks and 10 Mail until i got an answer.  I will never book with them again.,1
Flight from MNL-HKG then HKG-MNL. Check in was fast. The plane was clean but the other equipment was broken. Flight attendants were very friendly. They have in-flight games for entertainment that made passengers happy. A great budget airline all in all a good flight.,0
"Due to severe reduction of flights from Singapore to Hong Kong because of CoVid-19, I could not choose to fly with my favourite: Singapore Airlines, all their afternoon flights have been cut. I was left with the only reasonably priced option: Scoot. For today (Mar 12th), their 787 was deployed, and I was rather curious and looked forward to trying it. I had problems with check in at their computer kiosk, was directed to the assistance counter to complete my check in. The lady was not friendly nor very helpful. Never mind, hopefully the flight experience will make up for it. For today, no meals or duty free will be available to purchase. Instead, each passenger was given a bottle of water and a packaged croissant. I was sat the the so called quiet zone, load factor was very low, they still insisted to sit a lady in our seat of 3, where she could have any other seats (all 3 to herself!), not her fault but the airlines. The thing to do would be to move to another empty to give her more room (and myself), I was not allowed to. I was told due to the virus situation, passengers must not move to any seats for tracing purpose later if necessary. As a result, all 3 of us squeezed onto 6 D,E and F, endured a very uncomfortable flight, inside a 30% full cabin, thanks to the cunning arrangement of the check in agent. I had to take Scoot because I had no other choice, and they did not show me that flying with them had any benefits, besides the low price. 787 usually is very nice plane, but when it becomes a Scoot plane, it looked cheap and tattered everywhere, with very tight seat pitch, cabin crew were so so, doing the bare minimum. I dread to think how people endure long haul trips withe them from Singapore to Athens and Berlin in that same aircraft?!",1
"Singapore to Bali. I chose to travel with Jetstar Airways because of their promo priced at SGD130 for return, I usually pay sgd250-280 to garuda (as I have flexi schedule so travel any day is not a problem for me) with baggage allowance of 30kg and onboard meals, so I thought Iit wise for me to try Jetstar Airways out this time since I travel light. But this prove me wrong as they asked to weigh my bag at the self check in kiosks including my laptop bag and total allowance is only 7kg, how can this be possible? Even Scoot which is also one of the budget airline allowed 10kg cabin excluding laptop bag, I wonder how can they include the laptop bag to a total of 7kg allowance, I don't think anyone would be able to get thru this if you travel with a small cabin bag plus laptop, as laptop itself is normally 3kg and plus an empty cabin bag is 2kg, so unless you bring nothing in the cabin bag, else for sure you will need to buy a checkin bag on last minute which will cost you SGD60 which is half of the price of the airfare and not to add in the return baggage as well which will almost close to the price I pay to Garuda which is not a budget airline! So why should I still travel with Jetstar Airways in the future -totally pointless! First time encountered this with a budget airline and I will never travel with them again and won't bother to care about their promo caused this should not be the way for them to conduct business to suck their customer money like this and I feel is not ethical to use this way to lure your customer by promo but suck their money by forcing as in fact all of us caught by surprise and have no choice to pay.",1
"Darwin to Sydney. They advertise a competitive price and then gouge you with exorbitant fees at the check-in counter. They know you have no choice but to pay their fees at the counter otherwise you forfeit your flight and your holiday/business plans. The 7kg limit includes your carry on. People travelling interstate are not on a day trip and would realistically need to take more than 7kgs. A seasoned traveller would be aware of this trick but for the unsuspecting infrequent traveller's. I will avoid Jetstar in the future at all costs. My inward flight with Virgin and the same luggage was the complete opposite, such a positive experience from beginning to end.",1
AKL-SIN. Auckland-Singapore on A330. Plane is clean and new. Seats are not the most comfortable though. Since you have to pay for food and for the inflight entertainment system we brought our own food and entertainment so this proved to an enjoyable flight and for a good price. Recommended if you want to save money and don't expect spectacular service.,0
"Cebu Pacific is no frills and no favours with leg room, but in my experience the aircraft are clean and they run a pretty professional show. Flights were pretty much on time, save for ATC delays on the return flight to ManilaOne bone to pick - I chose not to purchase checked baggage, relying on the 7kg cabin allowance. At the end of the online checkin for the ATR flight, I was ""reminded"" (for the first time) that the carry-on allowance was only 5kg on ATR aircraft! And then having checked in, it was too late to purchase checked baggage! I was ready to point out to check-in staff that the 5kg limit wasn't mentioned on the website, but they seemed to be still operating on the 7kg limit.",0
"Yet again Jetstar has let us down. Arrive at airport at 6.30am for 8.00 flight. Flight cancelled. Told by staff, ""it's nothing to do with us, your travel agent should let you know"". How is that possible when the flight was cancelled that morning? No apologies at all. Only flight available was 5.10pm, so either wait at airport all day, or, go home and come back. Several hundred dollars in cab fares wasted, loss of deposits for activities in Melbourne, weekend getaway to visit friends ruined. Jetstar do not care at all because this is their common practice. Pitiful customer service.",1
"Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. I was told my bag was slightly too heavy to carry on so I had to repack it twice, and after some miscommunication paid 800.000 VND to check it (was told I could pay cash&card but I couldnt). The airplane had the tightest seats I have seen. There was no free water served, but they offered goods for purchase. The flight wasnt full and so I moved up a few rows but was told I couldnt sit there. It was a different class, but the seats were the same.",1
CGK-DPS-CGK. They take you from A to B and that's it. Web check-in was not functioning. Last minute change on departure gate. Delays seems to be normal when flying with them the only positive was the cheap fare.,1
"As much as I like and enjoyed travelling with Scoot, this is my worst encounter with their  call centre. Ive been issued with 2 vouchers due to the refund of the seats that I purchased for the past flights. Firstly, I do not have the option to choose refund of cash or refund back to my credit card. Secondly, if I proceed to redeem the vouchers, I have to pay the balance with a credit card, incurring a processing fee of $40, when I can have a choice to pay the balance via PayNow or through AXS machine, having to pay a much lesser processing fee of $4/$6. This is ridiculous!! I called the call centre and all they can do is to apologise for the inconvenience but they cant solve this issue that I am facing. Call centres are suppose to help to solve and reduce the problems that passengers are facing but Im appalled that sorry is the only solution that Scoot can provide. Very disappointed passenger.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Semarang. I was able to checked in earlier, 2 weeks before the departure time. The flight was on time from KL to Semarang, and apparently arrived 10 minutes earlier. Stewards were friendly to the passengers. It was a good flight for low-cost airline.",0
"Puerto Pricesa to Manila. Check-in and delivery of the case was quick and effective. Departure and arrival were on time. The aircraft made a well-maintained impression. The seat spacing was good, the on-board staff could be a little friendlier and the food was good against payment. Overall a good experience.",0
Tokyo to San Jose. If you fly Zipair you have to purchase everything ahead of time: meals and drinks.,1
I was excited to fly on Jetstar from SYD to HNL 787 but I didn't expect attitude from the attendants. There was a feeling from them that we are better than you are. A no frills airline should still staff it's planes with attendants that serve with dignity and grace. I felt that almost each time I addressed an employee the response was that I was being talked down to. I got that feeling and deplaned with disappointment.,1
I flew with Scoot last month to Singapore we had booked into economy class and upgraded to the nicer seats. My partner and I were happy with this arrangement knowing that it was only a 7-8 hour flight to Singapore we thought we could easily keep ourselves entertained etc. When we went to check-in on the morning of our flight we got offered to the ScootBiz for a few hundred more we decided to go ahead with the upgrade as we had the money to do so I think all up it cost about $550-600 each. ScootBiz was awesome and well worth the extra. I have flown Premium Economy with JAL before and it was terrible compared to ScootBiz. ScootBiz had good leg-room and nice wide seats you get to board first and get off first you get served when you want it. We took our own drinks and food on the plane and we were happy. ScootBiz gives you a meal and drink of your choice as well. I had read some horror stories but I found staff to be friendly and helpful.,0
"Bad policies, needlessly restrictive. Arrived at SGN from elsewhere in Vietnam and not allowed to check in for my connecting flight to Singapore because I was too early. (This wouldnt be an issue elsewhere in the world, as transfers would happen within a single terminal). So, rather than being able to pass the time enjoyably in the Orchid Lounge inside the terminal, which I have access to, I had to wait for 1.5 hours outside the airport or in the crowded departures hall. Garbage. They have also even further restricted carry-on baggage limits recently. Not serving passengers a glass of water without charge should be illegal. No inflight entertainment to speak of. Ive flown plenty of low cost carriers (Ryanair, AirAsia, Jetstar, etc), Scoot lands at the bottom of the pile.",1
"Singapore to Berlin. Scoot started flying to Berlin Tegel from Singapore Changi only recently, and I caught their latest flight to the German City. Kiosk check in & bag drop was seamless, and I was allocated an aisle seat, much to my relief. I would not have wanted a middle seat for a 12hr flight on a budget airline. Seat was what one would expect from a standard low-cost carrier - Average legroom with no entertainment. I had pre-ordered a long haul meal for the journey, and the food was largely decent. Crew were largely polite and professional. Value for money for a trip to Europe.",0
"Delhi to Bagdogra. Very good inflight service provided by cabin crews, specially Nayan & Somiya. Food served to us was very tasty. Thanks and hope to enjoy your service again.",0
Economy airline with really low special prices. Flew nearly 10 hrs Sydney to Honolulu return. Why don't they turn off the overhead TV screens rather than endlessly show the flight progress? This small detail would greatly improve the chance of sleeping. I didn't pay much so can't expect much I suppose.,0
Melbourne to Honolulu - we chose to fly Jetstar as it is the only airline that flies to Honolulu direct from Melbourne. It markets itself as a low cost no frills airline. It was certainly no frills but definitely not low cost. We flew the week before September school holidays and the airfares were very expensive. Overall I would describe the experience as mediocre. We were in economy and walking through business class I would not pay the extra for what looked like a sub par business class offering. The seats were okay but what you would expect on a domestic flight not a long haul international flight. It was a night flight so people were wanting to try and sleep. In the row behind us were four off duty Qantas flight attendants who proceeded to drink to excess talk extremely loudly and swear constantly disturbing other passengers for at least four hours. The flight attendants on our flight took about 5 hours to finally tell them to quieten down. I was astounded that they thought it was okay to disturb other passengers for hours on end. Appalling behaviour that should have been pulled up sooner. Inflight entertainment is non existent on back of seats which is ridiculous. You can rent Ipads for $18 which were woeful. The limited range of movies seemed to be geared towards the male audience. Even the lifestyle section was a selection of cars and music shows. They really need to take a good look at this very limited and poor offering. We heard many fellow passengers complaining about the Ipad content also. Food was either pre booked and very expensive meals or snacks you could buy on board. Take your own food on board would be my advice. It would have been good to see more gluten free offerings rather than a cookie. Service was basic not particularly friendly and mostly absent. Overall a below average experience.,1
"Male to Kuala Lumpur. This is a red eye flight, so you want to sleep after boarding. however the seat is very crowded. I booked a value pack and purchased another vegetarian meal for my mother. So I should get two meals totally. However I got only one meal served. They have killed their customer telephone number and I got no any reply even I left message on facebook twice and filled up a refund form online.",1
PER-DPS. The last three flights I have taken from PER-DPS I have paid extra for the 9.30a.m. flight. Not once have I flown at that time. They reschedule me to the 7.30am flight which was a cheaper flight. Now I just found out that the flight I booked PER-DPS has also been changed. I paid extra to fly out of DPS at 12.30p.m. and now have been rescheduled to the 10.30p.m. flight which on booking was much cheaper. I will never book with Jetstar again. Not only to they constantly re- schedule you they do not refund the extra money you have paid. Be aware when you book a certain time you are probably not going to fly at that time.,1
"Gold Coast to Perth Seat 9A booked a month ahead. Cheap airfares are cheap airfares so expectations shouldn't be very high. Taken off on-time arrived a whopping 40 min early (usually 5hr 20min flight) due to tail-wind crossing Australia. Staff were friendly good service. Living in the world's most expensive country paying $3.50 for an in-flight can of Coke was to be expected and OK considering the low price of the airfare. Did get complimentary glasses of water with ice on a couple of occasions. General observations clean aircraft but reclining button on my seat did not work making the lack of legroom (I'm 6ft 2"") slightly more challenging to handle.",0
Bangalore to Udaipur. The flight was 25 minutes delayed. During the flight too the cabin crew was rushing about offering snacks to getting the money from the customers.  I felt uncomfortable with the crew behavior during the entire flight. I will try to look for better service in the future.,1
"SYD-OOL. Arrived at the airport on time. Flight delayed 40 mins because crew had to come from a different aircraft. After crew arrived they did a quick check and started boarding the flight. However cabin crew were very rude. Crew virtually ran down the cabin serving food (I had my wallet out ready to buy something) ""any food would anyone like any food"". Then right in front of my face a massive high five.",1
"Wanted to order a coke can called the flight attendant saying excuse me thrice. On the third try the guy showed me his hand to wait.  I'll be skipping this airline due to the attitude of a flight attendant. As a low-cost airline no tv, no free food and the baggage allowance can't go more than 20 kg for which you have to pay too. The least they could do was to provide a good customer service.",1
"Bangalore to Kolkata. Scheduled departure time was 19:20 PM. Till now it is delayed by 3 hours and still waiting. The same thing has happened from CCU to BLR flight. That time flight started on time at 05:25 AM from CCU but unfortunately, the flight landed at HYD instead of BLR due to low visibility. I would advise avoiding Indigo to all of you.",1
"Denpasar to Yogyakarta. Overall quite satisfied but seat comfort is the main issue. I can't deny that I went for the cheapest tickets. Online booking was easy. Online check-in opens 24 hours before the flight and I was able to already select seats for free which was nice. Check-in and baggage drop-off at Denpasar Bali airport was quick. We booked 15kg of baggage, one bag was slightly overweight and I didn't bother too much beforehand. The employee weighed the two bags together and it said 29.2kg so no problem at all. I printed online boarding passes but we got new ones at baggage drop-off. Flight boarded nicely on time, about 10 o'clock before the 10.25 departure time. Pushback was at about 10.30 and takeoff just shortly thereafter. According to schedule, flight-time would be only 55 minutes and landing would be at 10.20 (Java time is one hour before Bali), but we landed at about 10.40. Taxi took only a minute and 10.50 we were waiting inside on our luggage. That took about 15 minutes to appear on the belt, maybe a little long. The flight itself was boring. There is no service available. Flight attendants seemed professional though. The seat was the main letdown. A little filthy and legroom insufficient. Should have been the same 29 inch pitch as on AirAsia but felt tighter. Couldn't keep my legs straight with my 1.92m and had to bend them. Because of the short flight it was doable but I would try to avoid this seat on longer flights. I would fly Lion Air again on short flights. Our flight operated nicely on time but I hear that can also be an issue.",0
"Check-in line management was extremely slow, that it took over an hour and 10 minutes to get to the counter. There was an unintelligible announcement that was later claimed by the airline as last minute check-in announcement. I was denied check-in more than 45 minutes before the flight time, when the boarding pass clearly said that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure time, for a delay caused by the airline's poor line management. I was not offered the option to pay a chhange fee. Instead, I had to pay the price difference for a same day flight, which was between as much as I had paid for the whole trip, up to double that. This has been the worst customer service I have received from any airline, anywhere, and I travel a lot. Will never fly this airline again, nor recommend it.",1
Sydney to Brisbane. Cheap airline blaming weather conditions to cancel flights with next availability more than 36 hours from the original time. Jetstar was the only airline cancelling its flight. No chat or phone line available to help.  Shame on you Jetstar.,1
"Had a horrible experience travelling with the worst seats and even the very limited push back didn't work at all for the entire row. Though it landed a bit early it was not a smooth take off and landing, seems trainees were operating it and the whole aircraft was tiny and smelly. The ground service crew at Singapore airport was very rough and rude in answering.",1
"Hong Kong to Singapore. I experienced awful customer service when I recently flew with Jetstar. Outside drinks weren't allowed on the plane despite the general terrible food served. Horrible attitude of staff on the ground. And in general, the policies around outside food and drinks are not clearly communicated. I would not recommend anyone to fly this airline, most definitely not families with little kids.",1
"Christchurch to Auckland. Will never use this airline again. Very rude and unhelpful check in staff, refused to help or offer any assistance with a name change on the ticket, staff cancelled the ticket immediately without any consideration (we paid 3x the standard amount due to the time of year). Called the contact centre in Philippines who had no procedures in place to accomodate a ticket update (we were 2 hours early so had ample time) - Also had no contact people in any airport to refer me to and could barely understand the issue we were facing. Re-booked flight with Air New Zealand.",1
"Taipei to Kuala Lumpur. I would like to compliment one of the staff at TPE check-in counter. He exhibit professional customer service in handling customer case by case. He portray the mission of AirAsia, low cost and high quality. He repeatedly provide options for customers with patient.  I would like to thanks him for making my journey with AirAsia a pleasant one.",0
The aircraft was ok and service was almost the same as other budget airlines. However it was delayed 3 hours and 2 hours+ respectively for my 2 flights. I felt uncomfortable that the cabin crew moved my luggage without asking for my consent. The cabin crew are rude they don't give way to passengers when they are selling food and beverages. I stood in the aisle and waited for 10 mins until one moved his cart back a little and I could go back to my seat. Although it is a budget airline they should know we are the customers and they should provide quality service not a budget.,1
"Dunedin to Auckland. I was given plenty of warnings about JetStar but I still flew. I am happy to report service was great from the check in to baggage claim. The check in staff was friendly with a great sense of humor, boarding was smooth, and the cabin crew pleasant. I even got a sandwich, which is more than I received on my flight to Dunedin on Air New Zealand. The crew moved up and down the cabin many times being solicitous of our wellbeing. Compared to Air NZ domestic, JetStar is the star.",0
SYD-SIN-SYD and would not use Scoot again. Our 7 year old daughter found the seats a great size but my size 8 wife and my average size were very uncomfortable. There were no comforts. No entertainment system without paying no drinks without paying (water was $4) no fold-out head rests no blankets ($12) no pillows ($10) no foot rests the seats were smallest imaginable (they ask you to pay more once on board if you want to move up to the yellow seat). The staff were polite and sweet. The meal we purchased was unappetising. Plane was new and the landings were very smooth so as far as safe flying I cannot complain but the level of comfort was surprisingly low.,1
"Jetstar offer a very poor service, even in their so called business class. The seating is cramped with the seat in front reclining right in your lap and the drinks service very poor with one glass of wine with your meal and thats it, I was not offered a top up at all. Inflight entertainment was poor with a selection of about 8 watchable movies and some TV shows, overall the entertainment was very ordinary. I would not fly this airline again considering the poor service and seating. There are other choices on this route in business class for around the same price.",1
"Just had the most disappointed message from Jetstar after going to Denpasar airport today to see if our flight are still a go ahead for next Saturday afternoon (28th March) and being told that it is still going ahead and if there was a chance there will be other alternatives that they would help with. Then this evening we have just reserved a message from Jetstar saying they will not be flying us home on the 28th and that the only thing is to give us a voucher, but as we have just discovered the flights that are earlier are over $1200 return per person. This is very poor on there behalf, they have not helped there customers at all.",1
"I have just flown from Melbourne to Sydney and it was the most dreadful airline I have ever flown. The check- in procedure at Melbourne Airport was appalling and I waited over 1 hour just to drop my bags off despite having an e-ticket. Staff were rude and abrupt and when I complained I was told ""this is only your opinion"". The planes are small and cramped and onboard staff were just as rude and treat you like a sheep not customers. The plane was delayed and very dirty as well. Save your money and book another airline even if it's slightly more expensive.",1
REP-KUL. I must say that fares aren't that much cheaper than full service airlines if you only book a few weeks in advance. There are a lot of additional fees some of which are not avoidable. If you have to change your flight you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security everything was a breeze. Organised boarding great cabin crew clean plane comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia. If its enough then book it.,0
"My flight has been canceled and when I have contacted customer Service they told me that I must buy another tickets (for 3 people) and I'll get the refund. So I have purchased the new tickets. Then Lockdown and my airport has been closed. I wanted to contact customer Service, but There was no chance to reach someone There. As instructed on their website, I used AVA thing to cancel Our flight, then I had to buy new tickets again. Of course before cancelation I've been informed that I'll get a refund. Till today (since march) I didn't get a penny.",1
"I would never recommend Jetstar for anyone. Terrible customer service, not fair at all, not good food and not responsible with well being of people. I had to pay $200 more for extra kilos (more than i have paid for my tickets) and in the end the baggage didnt arrive on my destination. Took half hour (at this point i was already crying) to someone come to help me with the missing baggage and as soon she came she told me they would refund me the $200 dollars as it was not fair i had pay for something than even didnt come in the fly. I never saw this money and my baggage just arrived 2 days after missing shoes on it. All my experience was disappointed.",1
"I had the worst customer experience trying to book the ticket. Their website and mobile app is bad, their payment system is even worst. I am not sure if I face issues as a foreigner and if the system works well for the locals but I have spent several hours trying to book a ticket and when I finally made it and I saw the money were taking from my account I thought that all went well. Out of luck I noticed some days later that the booking was not finalised and the money were returned to my account. They never contacted me via email about this. The actual ground service is actually good and their personnel on air is also good but their website and digital experience is the worst you can get.",1
"Auckland to Nelson, and Jetstar was pretty much what we thought it would be. A basic trip where you could pay for add-ons (like getting certain seats and drinks). Our flight was short, so we didn't really care about any of those ad-ons and thought we got a good deal on a flight. The checked bags also weren't that expensive compared to some airlines charge you per bag here in the states. I guess if you were flying further, this airline might not be the way to go since they don't seem to have any onboard services.",0
"Flight time was 19:35 at L16 gate, but changed to gate L4, and changed to gate L9, finally delayed to on boarding time to be 22:55 without any explanation. This is terrible experience.",1
"Auckland to Sydney. Cheap airline but if you have any problems youll pay for choosing this airline. I had damage and delayed luggage, the compensation is very low and so bureaucratic that it costs more to have legally signed paperwork than what the company gives. I can only imagine this is done to reduce claims to almost zero, Ive had issues in the past with airlines and never had this level of problems. Even correspondence thats 10 working days for each reply. Ive given in trying to claim money and learn from my mistake, the biggest on this occasion been flying with Jetstar in the first place. I can guarantee it will never happen again which is a shame because the airplane staff are the only asset this company has.",1
"Singapore to Perth. Not having flown Scoot before, given the negative reviews, albeit invariably from Australians, I approached the flight with a little trepidation. No worries! A couple of days prior to the flight I was offered and successfully bid for an upgrade at a reasonable price. Having arrived on a connecting flight I made my way to the check-in over 4 hours prior to scheduled departure. No issue. Fully automated with staff on hand to assist. No dramas during boarding or flight with 15 minute early arrival in Perth. Seating was something of a throwback to business class circa. 1980s - big hair, big chairs. Fine for a daytime flight but maybe problematic if overnight. The extensive range of food, as advertised in the menu, all available on board. Few so-called full price airlines can boast that. I had the pasta, not the worst I've eaten on a flight, the German chocolate quite delicious; Crew attentive regularly passing through to collect litter. The aforementioned carpers bemoan the lack of IFE etc. with Scoot. If that's important to you, fly Singapore Airlines et al at more than twice the price. Scoot does what it says on the tin. On this occasion I have no cause to find fault.",0
Dumaguete-Manila return. No problem flying from Dumaguete but the flight back from Manila to Dumaguete on the same day diverted due to low visibility. Flight diverted to Cebu for onward flight to Manila. We were told we could fly back the next morning from Manila and they were not responsible for our accommodation. If we did not want to go back to Manila we could get off at Mactan airport and we would have to make our way to Dumaguete at our expense. We ended up hiring a taxi to Bato that evening so we did not have to stay overnight in Cebu.,1
"Singapore to Perth via Bali. JQ117 leaves Singapore at 5.20am and arrives Perth 12.30pm, with a 50min stop in Bali on the way. On this trip this A320 aircraft was 1 of 3 versions and had more legroom because the seat pocket was above the tray table. Other Jetstar flights I've flown domestically and internationally, my knees hit the seat in front due to the layout and lower seat pockets, so i was very pleased with legroom, however the seats are lacking some serious padding and if the seat behind you puts something in the seat pocket and closes their tray table, the object pokes you in the back. We were lucky to get row 4 and I was actually seated next to a Jetstar employee who was hitching a ride back to Perth after working the same trip in reverse the previous day. The 1st leg I unsuccessfully tried to sleep for the 1st 30mins as we had been in transit at Changi airport for about 9hrs. I then struck up conversation with the Jetstar employee the next 1.5hrs went quickly with conversation and soon we descended for landing. On arrival at Bali all passengers had to disembark with all luggage etc, even though the same aircraft was our aircraft continuing to Perth and our seats were exactly the same.. this is probably the most poorly organised part of the trip. We disembarked at gate 9b, the last and furthest gate of the terminal. The transit lounge, as we followed signage on and on is at the other end of the terminal, where our tickets and passports were checked again, then security check again, where we lost our water bottles again (you learn to travel with empty bottles because every time you go through security you lose it). The metal detector was so sensitive, the only metal my wife was wearing was her wedding bands and it still set off the sensor and she gad to be scanned manually. Meanwhile all this walking and lines for checks takes up quite a bit of time, so by the time we were through ( and remembering we were in the front of the the aircraft so we disembarked fairly quickly), they started final boarding call for our flight. We checked the monitors - go to gate 9b, looking down the long terminal we couldn't even see N o9 so we started our brisk walk, 3 kids in tow. At about 1/2 way 1 child needed a toilet stop so three kept going and I waited, hearing again the final boarding call. We basically jogged the next 4 gates thinking we would muss it. On arrival at the gate my flustered wife and 2 kids were waiting, unable to board because I had all the tickets and passports. Anyway, another line up for another security check, this time full open all bag checks? Thos that somehow found time to buy water, lost them again, I was down to my last empty bottle. Finally boarded to find my Jetstar friend still beside me and hadn't had to disembark, they couldn't believe we had all just had to go the full length of the airport twice and 2 more security checks to get back on the same aircraft,  by this time my wife and I were pretty annoyed. We had to wait a while for all passengers to board, the last passengers being 3 quite elderly people who were also very flustered and short of breath, i felt sorry that they to had to walk that marathon. I was told i could refill my water on the aircraft, I asked several times but never got it. I asked for one with my pre-purchased meal but was told I could only get coffee or tea, was never offered to purchase one? Poor customer service. Overall not a great experience and it deminded me why I rarely fly Jestar.",1
My flight was May 6th 2022. The day before the flight they email me that the flight will be delayed to 2:40am instead to the original time which is 1:45 am. I checked in and waited for the time in front of the gate . But when I checked at the flight information board they re timed it at 3:20am (not sure for the exact time) and boarding gate changed too. As the time nearing they change it again to 4:00am and lastly they change the time again to 5:20am. They retime the flight 5 times. Its very upsetting. I went to the airport early to avoid the queue. Ended up staying in the airport for 8 hours before boarding. They delayed the flight without anyone talk to us what is happening. We are all tired. And we don't have a choice to sleep on the chair and floor.,1
"The flight departed before time and passengers were given safety kits prior to boarding and the middle seat pax were asked to put the safety gown on. I had Pre-booked my inflight meals and the snack box was sealed. The cabin crew wore their safety gown and masks all the time and ensures all the pax wore masks throughout the flight. I got the ticket in the best price and the legroom, cabin cleanliness, Cabin Crew, ground staff and the inflight meals were all top class.",0
Perth to Bali. This must be the worst airline that I have ever travelled with and I have not even left the ground yet! I make the booking for a pleasant time of day and even pay extra for the privilege then within a week they reschedule it to a horrible time. After four phone calls and several weeks of aggravation they finally manage get a booking on a flight leaving at 9 am - OK not a bad time. Then we arrive at the airport to be told that they have transferred our Aircraft to a domestic route and we are rescheduled from 9 am to 4 pm - OK Bali at 8 pm hotel at 10 not bad. Then an hour later they reschedule to 7 pm departure! Midnight at the hotel and a days leave wasted and I have not left home yet!,1
Gold Coast to Auckland. On check in I was offered an exit row which I accepted. Boarding was ordered and not congested. Deplaning was fast. Pre ordered a muffin and coffee as a result of an email from Jetstar one day prior which was delivered the first round of the beverage service. I was just given a chocolate muffin without a choice. No big deal though. Overall it was a great flight. I fly Jetstar whenever possible.,0
Flew LOP-DPS-CGK 8th Jan. Arrived LOP at 12 for flight - delayed 2.5 hours no announcement or reason given. Told my bag would be transferred in DPS to go direct to CGK. Land in DPS 15.00 for my CGK flight at 15.00 run to check in desk - flight delayed until 15.20. Explain I have an international Qatar flight to Doha at 18.25 told my bag was made priority to come off first and ground staff would be there to assist me when I landed. Land at 15.00 in terminal 3 need to get to terminal 2. No one waiting to assist me another 6 people in the same situation. Took 10 mins for several staff members to understand what's going on and help. Waited at terminal 2 for bags but never turned up. Forced to take Qatar flight without luggage. Check in your bags at your own risk.,1
HKG-MNL-HKG. Basic airline small snack selection but reasonably priced. Short turnaround times mean the plane isn't cleaned between flight - there were remains of the previous person's food in the seat pocket. Not a lot of legroom but okay. Note that if you print own boarding pass at HKG you still have to check-in as HKG don't accept home printed tickets just official ones. Ninoy Acquino Terminal 3 is the new international terminal - clean enough choices for food and drink etc.,0
TAA has re-timed their CNX-SIN flight and this is much better although it is a late arrival in CNX on the return sector. My flight to SIN was slightly early but the return was almost 30 mins early into CNX arriving at 2235 instead of 2300. Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer. All in all I'm starting to warm to their Changi service after an indifferent start in January.,0
BBI-DEL. Flight slightly delayed due to late departure at Delhi. Seated next to the exit no recline for the seat and the other passenger behind! Aircraft was clean although some parts broken. There were huge selections of snacks and beverages. Although the water comes in such a tiny glass you have to pay for it. Cabin Crew friendly and with a natural smile. Overall this airline is professional.,0
"Hanoi to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Customer service could not have been more unhelpful. We had credits towards a flight that due to a bug in their system they werent able to apply to our flight. Which is questionable - why should we pay for their error and incompetence? Every time we tried to rectify the issue we were issued a new agent and new complaint number and had to start from scratch every time. In the end, they said they were working to applying it towards our flight but it could also be used to pay for baggage. Of course the problem was never resolved, so we assumed we could at least check our baggage using our credits. Wrong. Apparently there is no systemic connection between the people at the air Asia counter and the customer service people online. The people at the counter were unhelpful at best. Ultimately, the customer service online system and the physical counter at airasia are somehow not linked. Very advanced system! We were told we had to request online 4 hours in advanced of the flight to use the credits towards our baggage. Of course this was not mentioned by customer service online. The people behind the counter were very rude and condescending and made no attempt to resolve the problem other than to tell us to contact online customer service - the same folks who had not responded to any of our recent inquiries/ noted we could just apply the credits to our baggage for our next flight. I have had the shit beaten out of me by a bunch of meth heads, and I preferred that to dealing with air Asias customer service.",1
"Hobart to Melbourne. Two flights, two issues. First, flight from Hobart to Melbourne cancelled, no notification, no reason given for cancellation. All of my contact info was correct and I was on a local phone system (received texts and email from other people). Next flight was three and a half hours later (it took off much later than that). I asked to be put on another flight as I had a meeting in Melbourne at 5. Jetstar refused because they had a later flight. Offered refund, but I had to eat all the fees, so the full refund was about 60%. booked on a Virgin flight for $200 more, but got there. Second, a policy issue. Flying from Cairns to Hobart via Melbourne. Jetstar will NOT check baggage through. Had to retrieve bags in Melbourne re-check them (and go through security, wait at check-in counter all over again). When I asked an employee why we could not check through he said that they were such a budget airline that they refused to pay for someone to sort the bags as they come out of the plane. He was completely embarrassed by this policy. From a customer standpoint it is tremendously inconvenient. I will never fly with Jetstar again!",1
"Flew Scoot from Tokyo to Singapore via Taoyuan. Seat and legroom: Spacious but configuration of 2-3-2 didn't make it feel like Business class. Food: One complimentary meal, one complimentary drink (not free flow). Food portions were very small and even to me as a small eater, it didn't fill me. Taste of food was acceptable. I had the braised chicken rice. Delay: Plane was found faulty at Taoyuan and we were delayed for more than 3 hours, stuck in Taoyuan International. Couldn't take off. They didn't let us off the plane as well for the first hour and it felt claustrophobic. When we went back 3 hours later, it was still the same plane. It took them another half an hour more before we got ready to leave. No compensation of any sort, just an apology which I found unacceptable.",1
"On 1 Aug 2020, I purchased a flight ticket from AirAsia. On 15 Aug 2020, AirAsia cancelled my flight and refuses to refund. They only offered credits. Everyone knows the credit is worthless. In AirAsia's audit report, EY has highlighted there is material uncertainty over AirAsia's going concern status (i.e. AirAsia might become bankrupt within the next year). If AirAsia goes bust, all credits are almost certain to be worthless! To AirAsia: You cannot open a flight, take our money, then cancel the flight to keep the money! This is unethical! As much as you need cash, you cannot do this!!! You've might have gotten my money now, but I will never fly AirAsia again, even after this pandemic!",1
"We've flown Perth-to-Singapore (economy) more than a dozen times. Pluses include price and comfort. This was our first (and probably last) business class flight with Scoot. Our son, based in Singapore, upgraded us as a gift. The sole benefit was seat size / comfort. I agree with a previous reviewer: Scoot airline attendants are confused. And who can blame them? Scoot advertises an Australian shiraz, but never, ever delivers. It really doesn't matter if you're flying Economy or Business Class, Perth-Singapore or Singapore-to-Perth, there's never, ever that advertised Wolf Blass Shiraz listed in the Food and Beverages catalogue. We really enjoy a glass of red with our evening meal. It just never happens aboard a Scoot flight. Happy to pay that S$9.00 per bottle, even in Biz Class (where it ought to be free) but no there isn't even one little 185 mL bottle of red aboard the plane. We fly abroad over four months every year. We find communication with nearly all airlines easy. Try to communicate with Scoot. It's truly a lost cause.",1
Flew Chennai Jaipur and return. Efficient service good value and organization from a cut price carrier. New clean aircraft friendly staff. Only problem was that out first booking had not actually been confirmed despite us having a booking number. I received nothing from Indigo to tell me this and I missed the small print on my booking. With an 30 minutes to spare a very helpful groundstaff person went to a lot of trouble to get us new bookings and got us the last seats on our flight. Brickbats for not providing better info re the not confirmed booking (we still don't know why) but kudos to the staff member who helped us in Chennai airport.,0
Travelling with Jetstar return to Singapore from Australia on a Airbus A320. No pillow no leg room find it very difficult to get in and out of the seat. No complementary drink. Airfare over priced for what you get nothing. After travelling with other cheap airlines with the same aircraft more leg room better service free drink pillow and cheaper fares.,1
Over an hour to check-in because we were too early and had to check in at the early counter. Only about a dozen people in front of us but it took an hour to check them in. Of course no lounge but I expected that. Priority boarding was people at the back of the plane board first oh and Business which meant a rush to the queue. The seats relined a little more than most standard seats. I asked to watch a tablet for entertainment and was told they were having technically difficulties and were not available. I since found out they haven't been available for months. Despite leaving at night and arriving in the morning you only get 1 meal and 1 drink. A comfort pack was extra we paid $8 for 1 blanket. We paid an extra $250 for: 1 Meal and 1 drink. Over 70% of the passengers boarded before us which meant the Gold Coast customs line was out onto the tarmac by the time we got off. They had 3 international flights arrive at once as they do most mornings. This airport can barely handle 1 international flight. Our flight arrived at 8.25am and we finally got out of customs around 9.40am.,1
HNL-SYD and HBA-SYD return. First of all our flight from Hobart was delayed by nearly 2 hours. When we arrived in Sydney were told that no luggage had been loaded. It was very windy in Hobart so I get why this happened but we were off to Hawaii. Had we been given notice before checking in the luggage that this was a possibility we could have got our swimmers out and left the big bag in Hobart. Anyway Jetstar managed to give us about 3 different stories about when our luggage would arrive in Hawaii and each was completely contradictory. I spent perhaps 3 hours in the first couple of days trying to chase down what was going on. On the HNL SYD flight the attendants all seemed to be lovely but were absolutely hopeless. They were disorganised we didn't get a veg meal that we had ordered. The cabin was an absolute pigsty too - there was an overwhelming smell of urine there were coffee drips on my tray table milk spilt over the seat a carton of milk shoved down the side of the seat previous passengers' rubbish in the seatback compartment. I took my daughter to the toilet about 10 minutes after the seatbelt sign had been switched off and there was urine on the floor. We got back to SYD late and we missed our connecting flight. I had tried twice before leaving HNL to check in online it wouldn't let me. Tried again before going through customs wouldn't let me. I then called once we had got though customs talked to someone who told me she should be able to get it done. I asked her if she could let me know the quickest way to get to domestic and she said she could then put me on hold. Very long story short I ended up on the phone to her for 38 minutes got to check in 29 minutes before takeoff and was not allowed on the plane. I have travelled with Jetstar many times and at this stage the bad experiences outnumber the good about 3-1. Last time on a flight from HBA to MLB I organised (booked and paid for) transport via Jetstar and ended up at the airport with the company having no record of it and refusing to pick me up. The thing that I think frustrates me the most is that through all this it has been me who has had to chase everything up. Had we had decent communication and correct answers it would have been manageable.,1
"My wife and I just returned from a trip to the Maldives on flights FD 177 and FD 178 (Bangkok  Male) on 26 Oct and 31 Oct and I must say they were the worst flights we have ever experienced. We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldnt a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for express handling. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1  hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority  everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal. So I ask you, would you put up with this type of service when paying premium fares for so-called better service?",1
On the 21st June I had a flight on Air Asia from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. It was a red eye flight and we arrived around 5am in the morning. I had to clear customs although I had a flight on Air Asia in the evening. The time went very quickly so it must have been a good flight. I was able to stretch out and get some rest.,0
Travelled first time on Air Asia between Sydney-KL-Penang and Sydney-KL in Business Class. Got a cheap deal as I booked months ahead. Both trips were very pleasant and the female air crew were very pleasant and efficient. Not too sure about the male crew as I only saw them sitting down or eating as their female colleagues worked. The Business Class seats were very comfortable and a pillow and duvet was provided. Food was warm and served at the time you requested. Ground crew in KL kept customers waiting for more than 20 mins as they served 1 customer with issues. Common sense would dictate that this customer be served separately and kept the line moving. Staff were very strict with luggage allowance as I saw many people re-packing at the counters. A good trip and I would fly Air Asia again.,0
"Spent 13hrs at Bali airport before being advised flight is cancelled. Unable to find anyone to speak with from Jetstar. Finally get a flight 28hrs after original flight. Advised by captain what had happened, better late than never. Hot beverages, no they are cold beverages. Look at the picture of the coffee on the menu as to what is actually served. Flight crew, some lessons in responsible serving of alcohol are needed. Seat comfort, my arm rest was taped up with duct tape.",1
DMK-PNH. Flight delayed maybe 30 min but arrived 15 min late. Communication regarding delay not sufficient. Otherwise very good flight in clean plane with friendly staff - as every time I've flown Air Asia. Did not have a meal on this flight but on previous flights food has varied between 2 & 4 stars in my book.,0
My comments relate to the Jetstar Airport lounge (gates 25-30) at Melbourne Tullamarine airport. My flight is JQ 61 to Darwin on 29/1/13. I've never had a problem with travelling on any of JQ flights but this waiting area is disgusting. Many seats are in poor repair and actually have a very unsavoury odour and the floors are littered with rubbish. I appreciate that this may be a period between cleaning team arrival but it's very tacky and would give a poor impression to all travellers.,0
"Bali to Bangkok with AirAsia. I don't normally use low cost airlines and this was only my fourth flight on a low cost and I fly at least 12 times each year. All previous flights where on AirAsia and only pretty short so I was a bit scepticle using them for this 4h+ flight. The direct options between Bali and Bangkok are limited to either Thai or AirAsia from what I can see, the AirAsia schedule suited me better so I choose the full package including luggage, Red Carpet Service, preferred seat, food and comfort kit. Check in was quick using the red carpet service which was also fully escorted from check in through security to the lounge. The lounge is old but so is the airport but fine to spend an hour with food and wifi. Boarding through gate 6a was done with priority and included a bus ride on my own as part of the red carpet service. Once onboard seat 1A was fine with enough space, not the most comfortable seat but okay. Crew where young but polite the food was also okay for airline food. Take off right on time with a flight time a little longer at 4h20m so landed a little late. Bags took a little time to arrive once off the flight at DMK. Otherwise a great flight and great service from the ground crew at DPS all for less than 100 which was half the cost of the nearest indirect option with the other direct option costing 3 times more.",0
"Star Class CNS-TYO and economy TYO-OOL. Flights were on time. In Star class we sat at A1 & A2 the seat had duct tape on the arms to cover up holes. The tray table would not fully fold out and everything kept slipping off it. The service was really good and the food was also very good. The Ipads can be a bit annoying as you have to find somewhere to put them as the front seats have no ""pockets"" to put your items in. Due to putting bags on first in CNS we were the last to receive our bags in TYO which is not like business class on other aircraft's. (You shouldn'thave to wait 45mins for your bags if you are paying a higher price for seats). Economy class on the return was good. The flight was not full so everyone was spaced out. The food was also good quality. Tip if you are pre purchasing a Ipad you will need to provide photo ID a lot of people did not have photo ID and passport is not acceptable (which is strange as you have to pass airport security to board the flight).",0
"Flying with Jetstar felt like being part of a special performance where the crew believed they were doing passengers a colossal favor. From the relentless PA announcements about how the crew should be treated, you'd think we were aboard a magical unicorn, not a plane. I get it, some passengers can be a handful, but did we really need to hear the ""be kind to your crew"" mantra four times during the flight? Speaking of the crew, they might want to consider that their primary role is to assist passengers. I asked for a glass of bottled water to take my heart medication. Her response? ""I can't help you, but you can pay $4.00 or drink tap water."" It wasn't about the four bucks; it was about the complete lack of empathy and urgency, especially when I explained that tap water wasn't an option due to my medical condition. Sure, I'd bring my own water onboard if I could, but thanks to Australian regulations, that's a no-go. For medical reasons, the crew should consider making exceptions or providing assistance.  The crew's customer service skills and smiles were about as rare as a blue moon. Upon landing in Sydney, the baggage ordeal was a two-hour-long spectacle. No announcements, no apologies. They even managed to announce the wrong baggage belt twice before passengers had to play detective to locate their belongings. It was absolute chaos  more circus than a well-oiled operation. The only reason I'm being generous with a 1 and not a 0 is because the aircraft did land safely. But if you're looking for a magical, circus-like experience, Jetstar might be your ticket.",1
Travelled in a group of 40 KUL-CNX on 29/11/2012. Upon arrival to LCCT the crowd at LCCT was horrendous especially during holiday season. However we managed to check in our luggage within an hour thanks to efficient ground staff who was at the counter alone. CNX-KUL on 2/12/2012. Chiang Mai airport was much more less crowded early in the morning it was only AK flight at that time but were surprised that the check in procedure took more than an hour! There were one lady at front counter one at the back helping to cut the e-boarding pass and stick the stickers to the check in luggage. We should have been checked in as a group and not 2 by 2! My question is what if there are 3-4 groups checking in simultaneously? Some could miss the flight?,1
"Penang to Singapore. Seats are slightly better compared to AiraAsia. However, priority privilege such as board me first was not given after purchasing. Flight experience was acceptable for low cost carrier flights.",0
BKK - Phnom Penh - BKK Checked in online 24hours in advance which was very convenient and got seats allocated together Airport baggage drop very quick and efficient. Flight departed 15minutes early and arrived 25minutes early. seats comfortable legroom ok for a lo-cost carrier. baggage very quick on arrival. Return journey checked in at the desk very quick and efficient. Although flight was only 1/3 full we didn't get seated together and were put across the aisle from each other despite the two seats next to me where empty. Flight on time and arrived early baggage again very quick.,0
"Don't accept the credit. Cancelled my flight and offered a refund (pre-covid). Since then they have tried to convince me to accept a credit instead and they have stalled with giving me my refund. They were only 20$ cheaper for this trip compared to another company that I was supposed to fly another leg of my trip with. And that company has already given me my money back months ago because Airasia cancelled this part of the trip. If you accept the credit you change the terms of your initial deal and you are now subject to their new terms. By not accepting the credit they are still obligated to the conditions of your initial contract. You can demand your money back through the bank that handled the transaction. You can demand the money back through the card company if you paid via Visa, Mastercard etc.",1
"We flew with Jetstar from Sydney to Honolulu return in economy class as a family we pre ordered our meals and entertainment prior leaving. We were welcomed onto the aircraft by staff, the aircraft was clean on both trips, it left Sydney 5 minutes early, meals were good value. In flight entertainment has plenty of choice. Only downfall was the Check in on Hawaii end was a little slow checking in. Overall a good flight, leg room was a little tight for us over 6 footers",0
"We were incredibly frustrated and disappointed when our flight experienced a delay of more than three hours. It seemed absolutely ludicrous considering the plans we had in Auckland, where we had important people to meet and a car to pick up before the rental company closed its doors for the day. This unforeseen delay not only threw off our schedule but also added unnecessary stress and uncertainty to our trip. We had meticulously planned our arrival time to ensure a seamless transition, but now we were left scrambling to rearrange our plans and salvage what we could from the situation. It's disheartening when a mere delay has such a significant impact on our travel plans, especially when there are time-sensitive commitments waiting at our destination.",1
22 Feb 13 BKK-SIN. Flight delayed 2 hours. Letter handed out stating for operational reasons. Nothing else offered. We were given emergency exit seats however. Flight full but uneventful. No explanation of regret offered for late arrival. Cabin Crew worked well.,0
"Nice, uneventful short flight, clean aircraft, super nice crew. Left on time, arrived on time. Only ""negative""? Parked a bit far away from arrival at DMK.",0
"Dumaguete to Cebu. Worst airline in the world. No service, period. There is no pre-boarding cooling procedure apply. People are boarding in a hot cabin without air-conditioning. The seats are straight 90 degree without reclining support. They never clean their seats between flight since there always delay. Always late without any announcement, or the announcement are not up-to-date information just reading out of script. One of my friends even got canceled flight and bus to Cebu early morning via a van. Keep changing their flight schedule also every quarter. I wish there is another airline to join this route to compete.",1
"Jetstar is a very miserable airline.  Flight are delayed. On board you have to buy food and also water. It's low cost company I understand, but on long flights like the one I had (8 hours) they should provide at least snacks and water. If your baggage exceeds for 1 gr the weight limit, they will charge you a crazy fee. At the boarding time it was a mess, disorganised. Overall I'd rather pay more money to any other airline.",1
"Butuan City to Cebu City. Cebu Pacific is a no frills airline, a basic flying experience without food, etc - which I like if you're travelling on budget. The flight was on time but nothing to write home about. But the price of the ticket I paid was to be desired and look forward to flying again with this airline. All in all I was able to reach my destination on time at reasonable price. A buy-on-board snacks are available.",0
"Batam to Bali. Late as always - When are they going to manage this problem? We arrived at the gate before boarding time was due. We asked 30 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off if there was a delay. Ground crew told us that the flight was ON TIME. However in fact it was delayed by almost 2 hours. We were not advised of any delay until passengers started to ask the ground crew as to what the problem was. We were not offered any refreshments as outlined by the Ministry of Transport. When we asked about refreshments from the ground crew they said - we are preparing the food. However it never arrived. When we asked the crew on the flight - they said the food is not their responsibility. That this always happens that there is a delay but food is never provided because the ground crew are a different group to them. We said the responsibility was Lionair. They tried to explain that Lionair flights are often delayed and therefore it would be very expensive for the airline to provide compensation to all flights, because so many flights are delayed! They then said that they were only the airplane crew and they didn't know if they were late because they never come off the plane! Total lies. Then when they did agree that they we were in fact delayed, they started disagreeing as to how long the delay was. Making up stories about how a delay is calculated. Finally they came to us and said the delay was exactly 1 hour and 52 minutes and that it wasn't delayed by 2 hours. But still nothing about the fact that we should have received compensation in the form of snacks, food etc. as laid down by the Ministry of Transport.",1
"1 hour 20 mins stood up in line to to check in, not enough check in staff. When you go the gate there is plenty of staff standing around doing nothing. Approximately 6 to 8 staff hanging around for no reason. Flight had too many Unnecessary radio announcements from Cabin crew and pilot even repeating the same things.  Scoot do not give a small bottle of water on a 2.5hr flight, and it is difficult and slow to try and purchase a drink there is only a 20 minute window of opportunity to purchase then you will be told it is closed. All drinks apart from full sugar coke and water were out of stock. If you want to use power socket to charge phone at your seat you must log onto their system and pay $6 by credit card. I'll never fly with Scoot again.",1
Although I fly 50000+ miles a year around Asia I'd never flown on Jetstar before (flight was booked by a travel agent without any further info). I flew on 2 May from Perth to Bangkok. The trouble was I took an aspirin 10 minutes after takeoff and asked for a water. I was told it cost $4 cash. All I had was my ATM card. Four dollars: for a bottle of water on a 5 hour flight. Then I noticed I was sitting on a stripped Airbus that could easily pass for a re-purposed 1971 Trailways bus. No video entertainment zero amenities - 5 hours with nothing to do. I am sure Jetstar would install pay toilets if they could. Flying Jetstar left me with a renewed appreciation for Thai Airways and KAL. I will make it a point to specifically avoid Jetstar in the future at all costs which has easily been the worst experience I've had flying in decades.,1
"Delhi to Istanbul via Doha. We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on. But the crew instead of sending them back to their seat, make them sit in the first row, which is a paid row.",1
Perth to Bali. Flight cancelled just before boarding due to a sick crew member. Surely they should have a pool of relief staff. Poor communication from ground staff and will never fly with them again. Our trip to Bali has just more than doubled in price as we needed to book last minute with an alternative airline in order to make it for a special Birthday celebration.,1
Melbourne to Gold Coast. My flight was delayed three times in the one day. I sat in Melbourne airport for nine hours. This is the first & last time I fly with Jetstar. Ive lost an entire day worth of work.,1
Singapore to Taipei return. I am writing in to compliment the cabin crews onboard both flights. I felt they have discharge their duties very well and I'm highly appreciated them for their service onboard the aircraft. I was very warmly welcome by the crews onboard. Scoot is a budget airline but the high service standard is really very good.  I deeply appreciate their commitment to keep passengers safe &sound for their flight.,0
"Scoot offers 1st change of date free due to Covid when you book on the airline's own website, however when you try to rebook it shows you much higher fares and claim those are the best available. Then a curious customer like me opens a new window, does not login, searches the fare for the same date on Scoot's own website and sees lower fares. I contacted Scoot support and was told to ""delete cookies from my browser"", then that I am too late to change my flight (which I was not), and then to hang on the line while the agent supposedly checked time zones, and then the agent was able to process the change but with a fluctuating ""fee from nowhere"" which was ""automatically calculated on the backend"" and which eventually converged on less than EUR10. The agent refused to check alternative dates where I would not have to pay any surcharge. Not the fault of the service agent.",1
My wife and I flew from Sydney to Kuala Lumpar and then on to Phuket with Air Asia in business class albeit the KL to Phuket sector did not have any business class - which we had been warned about prior to the trip so this was no surprise. We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer. As far as value for money goes I could not have wished for a better experience. We will certainly use this airline again where possible.,0
AK827 on 23/9 from Phuket to KL then KL to Sydney on 23/9 Flight D722. Return was on D223 Sydney to KL on 7/10 then same date KL to Phuket on AK222. I booked well in advance for a trip to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur and am a frequent flyer with Aisr Asia so am aware of the restrictions for the excellent price and service which is provided. I would have liked to have been informed that there was no Business Class Lounge at Kuala Lumpur airport and also it would have helped if they had given us some idea of the great distance between Gates. I cannot fault their service at the desks through the Gates and on the aircraft. Business Class is extremely comfortable and with the exception of the food and beverage arrangement which I was aware of very good.,0
CNX-KUL. I've never used a low cost airline before but the alternative on this route involved a transit in BKK so I took Air Asia for convenience more than anything else. While the bag drop was slow and the food not that good the service was fine as was the aircraft a fairly new looking A320-200. The seat was comfortable enough for a 2hr 20min flight! The flight arrived just about on time and I was through the low cost terminal in 20min; I picked a seat paid for a 25kg bag and had food. The cost still came in 65% less than the other options on this route so no complaints and I would use again for convenience.,0
"One-way economy Coolangatta-Taipei (via 8 hour layover Singapore). Departure and arrival on schedule. Paid extra for a ""yellow"" seat with more leg room; 5+ kg luggage; and ScootThru. Later decided to upgrade to ScootBiz but the website does not allow for upgrading. Check-in very crowded slow and understaffed. Avoided the crowd by going to the ScootBiz counter and upgrading but could only upgrade to Singapore. I had to upgrade Singapore- Taipei at Changi. ScootBiz is not luxurious. Seat is a little wider and with a power outlet. Metal foot rest is uncomfortable. Meal was a sandwich and a small can of Pringles plus a drink. Flight crew were young energetic all very nice and well groomed. The pilot and crews English pronunciation were mostly incomprehensible. Entertainment package - you login using a special PIN. There are no instructions on how to set up your computer. No one from Scoot will help you. Upon arrival in Singapore I went to the Transfer counter in Lounge E Terminal 2 to get my new boarding pass. Transfer desk had 2 people working I waited 45 minutes. At Changi Airport I had gone to the Widevine Media Optimizer website and downloaded the entertainment browser add-on after which it installed without a problem. The entertainment system then worked from Singapore to Taipei. All-in-all if you are looking for a reliable and cheap no frills airline Scoot is okay. Every extra will cost you some money.",0
Booked to fly from Gold Coast back to Singapore turned up at the airport to be told that flight was delayed. Original flight time was 9.15am and new time was now 6pm in the evening - told that I had received an email which I hadn't neither had the other 20 people who were also there to check in - no apology no vouchers only told to return to the airport at 4pm. I had a connecting flight from Singapore to Frankfurt at 12pm that night and told Scoot staff that I would miss my connecting flight they weren't bothered when I pushed about returning at 4pm the staff member finally admitted that they didn't even know if they flight would go at the proposed time that evening as the plane had to come from China and hadn't left there due to a snowstorm! Had to go to Air Asia and pay for a flight to Kuala Lumpur and then another flight with Tiger to Singapore to get back in time. NOT worth the cheap fare won't be flying with them again.,1
RGN-BKK-RGN. Check in at Yangon International Airport hassle free. Flight call by seat boarding fine greeted by smiles and seated behind the emergency exit row. Landed at Bangkok on time and was first to receive baggage. Check in at Bangkok was okay but not as good as Yangon.,0
"Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. It was absolutely one the most unpleasant experiences Ive ever had with an airline. The seat was uncomfortable, the service was bad and the flight got delayed for 6 hours. I heard lots of complaints about Jetstar but still decided to choose it. Lesson learned, never again!",1
MNL-Cebu-Caticlan. Second flight was delayed for 9 hours. The ATR had technical problems and apparently Cebu Pacific did not have engineers to solve the problem. Staff were friendly and felt sorry for the delay: They even gave a voucher for a free flight to be used within 6 months. As I paid not even 3000 Php for both flights I can t complain.,0
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. I know from the start that this airline is the worst airline among all airline in Indonesia. Well known for their bad reputation and deserves it.  Cheap but not have good quality (seems like they always have issues).  Just let you know if u were on budget trip please use other airline, there are plenty whose cheap but not as bad as this airline.",1
"Flew Bangkok DMK to Tokyo NRT. Scoot is the SG low cost carrier but travelling in Scoot Business gives you pretty much a full service carrier experience. Priority check-in at the airport, but no priority security or lounge access, free checked bag, meal on board, etc. Check-in at the airport was quick and efficient and DMK is not the busiest airport in the world so both immigration and security were quick. We arrived after boarding had started but given that we had ""board me first"" status we were actively sought out by the gate staff and whisked around the boarding queue. Seats in Scoot business are very much like the seats found in premium economy on most airlines, so 22 inch wide with 8 inch recline. They are very comfortable. There is no IFE but WiFi and a streaming service is provided free of charge in business. A hot meal is included in the price which can be either pre-booked or ordered once on board. After boarding we were given the choice of having our meal straight away or prior to landing. Everything else not pre-booked is charged for at reasonable prices. The crew were very warm and friendly and seemed genuinely eager to please. Given the excellent price point Scoot is highly recommended for 5-6 hour flights such as this one.",0
"Very disappointed with Air Asia as a frequent flyer after last experience. Online check-in had errors and glitches which did not allow me to checkin early, charged 40,000 yen at airport. Showed pictures of website glitches and errors, airline does not care or understand. Then I was accidentally tripled charged on my return flight baggage. Had 5 transactions for baggage totaling over $800 USD! My two tickets cost only around $700. Was refunded for some of the excess charges, however such a hassle and online help and calling is very time consuming and stressful and not user friendly. I figured if I provided pictures and explained my problems the airline would understand the online checkin and website had experienced problems and was not working properly. Poor customer service using live chat and submitting cases on issues, just replied back with automated answers. Like talking to a computer. Nobody should have to get charged over $800 USD and worry about 5 charges for 2 small check-in bags, especially unauthorized charges. Very disappointed and will never fly again because of airlines poor recognition of the problem, poor customer service and failure to refund a small cost that should never of happened. Nobody should have to go through that stress while on vacation!",1
"The Lion Air flight was delayed for an hour. The boarding gate were overcrowded as many flights to different cities were also delayed. Flight was smooth. The cabin was comfortable. Luckily it was a short haul flight, so I didn't mind the short seat pitch. You get what you paid. With low ticket price, I wouldn't have high expectation.",1
Never again! Most terrible experience. No carry on bag allowed! I will never fly this airline again. Prefer to pay a little more but treated with respect.,1
Fully satisfied in the past however my last two trips were awful. Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure. This has now happened to me a few times in the past when there was separate check-in counters there were no issue.,1
"Gold Coast to Sydney. Stingy airline. You get what you pay for but worse in actual fact. Its worth paying more to avoid the scrutiny Jetstar have with their baggage restrictions, poor quality seating and mediocre staff. I got slogged $60 for baggage being 2kg over their limit with no change to go through my bags. Never again",1
"I have travelled from Bangkok to Melbourne on 10/07 with the new Boeing 787 JQ30. I have never experienced such poor seat design and configuration in my life leg room is non-existent if you drop something on the floor you can not pick it up. Width of the seats is such that you have to keep your hands in your lap at all times. Seats can barely recline. I'm not a big person. They crammed 340 passengers on this plane which normally carries 250 people with other airlines. I will never fly with this company again and I highly recommend to all other travellers to avoid flying with them no matter how the cheap fares are. Such a waste of a ""Dreamliner"".",1
Every time I travel with Cebu the plane is either late or cancelled. If they weren't so cheap I would never use them. Customer service is appalling regard for international flight safety rules is scant (I have seen children allowed to sit in exit rows people standing up during taxi phones used prior to landing. My last trip has prompted me to write as my flight was cancelled (again) we were bussed 1.5 hours to another airport to find that the flight there was delayed too (no announcement only found out when we asked). We were given no water for the bus journey the bus driver was constantly on the phone and driving with one hand even when changing gear and the food offered (or 150 pesos instead - $3) was pathetic. I feel sorry for their staff who constantly have to deal with upset passengers like me because their employer is so hopeless. I worry that this airline is starting flights to Dubai in the Autumn - rather you than me!,1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Really bad experience start to finish. They offer 20 flights a day, then cancel 90% of them not offering immediate other options in hope that people dont apply for refund. Was only able to get another flight because I paid extra, food was also canceled despite I paid extra on it when I booked. I added another big bag and a carry-on. Was 2kg over with my carry on because I had a handbag with me. Had to pay $65 dollars extra. Staff was nice but the company policies at such times are just unacceptable. Won't fly again with them.",1
Flew Melbourne to Phuket on new Dreamliner in Business Class on 9/2/2014. This was such a nice surprise to be on this plane. Even the staff seemed happier. Also the food was of a higher standard than I have had on previous flights. After saying all this there are two areas that need me. One is the cleanliness of the seats. Many were stained and the other is that they do need more choice on the entertainment side.,0
"Auckland to Sydney. Lost the bag, but did not let anyone know so we hung around for an hour while that was being figured promised to deliver between 4 to 8pm the next day. No one showed, promised to deliver before 12.30pm on the next day no one showed, finally turned up at 2.30pm after 5 phone calls and attempt to go through the online complaint system that resulted in being told that someone would get back to me in ten days. Hopeless customer service.",1
"Bangkok to Singapore, and a great experience flying with Scoot! First time I had flown with them. Plane was quite large, made you feel like you had room, and  wasn't cramped. Empty seats all around, lots of room to stretch out. Great for short trips, if you only have a carry on bag. No snacks or drinks included in flight, but it's a budget airline. Price of the tickets was well worth it. Would definitely fly with them again.",0
"Jetstar insist frequently enough during the online ticket purchase process that passengers must get to the airport 2 hours prior to departure which we dutifully did, arriving at Melbourne airport a bit before 4 am, to catch the 6:05 am jetstar flight to Sydney. When we arrived check in had just opened and there were only 2 staff checking baggage. Got our baggage tag and got in the queue. Then they proceeded to call out every single passenger whose flight were departing before ours, regardless of where they were in the queue. At one point the front line stood still for more than 49 minutes whilst jet star personnel were pulling people out of the other lanes and getting them checked in. When we finally got seen - after a riot nearly broke out - the check in guy told us we had less than 5 minutes to get through security and make our flight. We had to run like mad. Our flight was at 6:05 am!  I don't care about the pay per use for extra stuff like bags, food, seat assignments etc - it's a nuisance but fine. I'll pay, as long as I get the service. The lack of a coordinated path to check baggage for passengers and poor organization at the airport is simply not acceptable and no cheap airfare makes this worth the anxiety! It is maddening and made me angry and resentful. I can't believe this airline is a Qantas offshoot. In the end don't bother with the 2 hours early part. It does not make any difference trust me!! At least not for domestic flights departing Melbourne. Get there 45 minutes before your flight, flag a staff member and tell them your flight is boarding now and you'll get right up the front of the queue and wave bye bye to the poor sops who play by the rules. Basic definitions of service do not apply here and it is NOT first come first serve as they claim. It is next flight out gets first priority, which makes for a highly stressful experience. Definitely not worth the aggravation from my personal experience.",1
My trip from Changi to Jakarta was pleasant I choose the seat near the emergency door and the leg stretch is very good. The trip back was nice and smooth it is a no gimmick airline. For me you've got what you pay.,0
Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast with AirAsia as a single parent with two young children (5 & 3). Received the boarding passes which revealed I was sitting across the isle from my children. Tried to have all three of us sitting together. Unfortunately this did not happen and AirAsia staff said this was fine. My recommendation is to pay the extra dollars and allocate your own seating with this airline.,0
"Worst experience ever with any flights, not recommended at all. First, they delayed the flight for 1 hour with congested flight seats which was not comfortable at all, after landing we had to wait for 1.5 hours for our baggage but they didnt bring in flight. We came for holidays and we mentioned that to them but still no response. On holidays we had nothing with us even after 24 hours we cant track our baggage. No communication between staffs and they were very rude at Brisbane airport. They didnt even show any sympathy or regrets for ruining our holidays. Jetstar should shut there company or improve your service and give some training to staff. We are not travelling with you in free, we are spending a lot of money so this type of behaviour is not tolerated at all. After more than 24 hours we are without our baggage on holidays.",1
They cancelled our flight to Caticlan. Asked us to take another flight to Kalibo 3 hours later. When we demanded a refund they said they would only refund one way and that we had to forfeit our return ticket. After hours of waiting we found out that they had other flights to Caticlan which they told us was cancelled but actually continued. After arguing with the counter staff and managers only were we allowed to take another flight to Caticlan. Same issue from Caticlan to Manila. Flight was cancelled. After continuously complaining at the counter they allowed us to take the earlier 5J Cebu Pacific flight back from Caticlan to Manila. Horrible Service.,1
"My flight was suppose to be at 4.35 pm on 31/10/22. The flight got delayed to 5.50 pm. So I waited. After half an hour the flight got delayed another time to 6.40 pm. Isn't this ridiculous? We need to be there 2 hours before departure and the flight is delayed than 2 hours. I for one did not have enough currency to buy any food  and I was like super hungry.. by the time I reached KL I was starving.  This was a very bad experience for me. The cabin crew was so unfriendly, never even greet the customers when they enter, busy talking to themselves.",1
"Perth to Tokyo Narita via Cairns with Jetstar. My 2 flights were okay Jetstar considering it was lost cost. My first flight was at the worst flying time (midnight - 4:30) after that flight I was extremely tired and fell asleep on a bunch of chairs for my 6 hour layover at Cairns, (would say try to avoid Cairns due to awkward flying times). Anyway, flight attendants we're a bit chatty throughout the flights but were friendly and helpful. We got food for free on second flight bc we paid for baggage. Probably one of the nicer meals I had on flights. First flight on an A320 the seats were not the most comfortable but on the 2nd flight we sat at a bulkhead so heaps of legroom. Overall I would say very good for a budget airline and a high value for money.",0
ADL-MEL JQ773 8/2/2013 Airbus A320 aircraft. What a pleasure to have been greeted by a friendly Flight Attendant when our boarding passes were being checked inside Adelaide Airport Terminal. Upon boarding the rear of the aircraft again a pleasant welcome from the Flight Attendant. Welcomed onboard with a smile. Aircraft was clean and the seats comfortable. I did not purchase anything on this short flight but service from the crew was efficient. There were announcements from the pilot during the flight and also upon landing in Melbourne. This is the third time I have flown with Jetstar and I have always found the crew to be professional. This is a budget airline and I did not pay for all the extras but cannot complain.,0
ScootBiz from Gold Coast to Singapore return. Dedicated lane for business check-in and express lane through immigration at GC all a bonus. Booked the rear seats in business class and found them very comfortable and better than Jetstar business but not as good as Air Asia X business class. Food was not appealing and very basic but for under $500 dollars one way was not complaining. The staff looked very young and were helpful but not of a standard of usual business class but once again its a low cost airline. I enjoyed a nice sleep travelling in both direction and was very refreshed on landing. Food and drink on plane was expensive especially water. Major complaint was after getting on and off plane before everybody else when collecting bags both times my bags were last to appear on carousel. Long wait and then long wait at immigration.,0
"Very poor ground staff experience at Delhi after arriving from Heathrow, en route to Amritsar. The Virgin flight arrived at T3 and we told to go to T1 for our Indigo flight. I managed to find the ticket desk to buy the shuttle bus tickets. Some passenger took taxis. When we arrived at T1 our boarding passes did not allow us entry, by security. We were told to go to the Indigo desk, who informed us we needed to go to T3 for our flight! About 10 of us all protested and asked them to recheck. After checking, they realised they had made a mistake. They issued new boarding passes and managed to give them to the wrong passengers and luckily we sorted it out amongst ourselves. Their check in and transfers at Goa and Delhi were so chaotic.",1
Flew between Sydney and Uluru. The flights themselves were what you would expect from a budget airline. The check-in process however was a total shambles. At Sydney Airport there was just one long line for all their departures. Using the automated check-in machines was a waste of time - when we eventually reached the check-in desk the baggage tags we'd carefully put on were unceremoniously ripped off. We were still in the middle of the long line having arrived two hours before our scheduled departure time when we heard someone shouting our flight number. With great difficulty we managed to extricate ourselves and baggage from 'the maze'. Eventually we found the check-in desk where our flight number was being shouted. The check-in clerks were complaining to each other that they weren't being sent the right passengers. The return flight from Uluru wasn't much better despite being the only departure that afternoon. At the check-in they waited until all the passengers arrived before they very slowly began the process. Very galling to watch them sitting behind the check-in desks doing nothing while we all stood in line. Even when they did condescend to start work they seemed to believe that chatting between themselves was a higher priority than dealing with their customers. Value for money? I would want to be paid to experience that again.,1
"I have flown Cebu Pacific multiple times only because Philippine air did not have many choices for our flight plans. You cannot talk to anyone on the phone to resolve problems. The website and app are terrible. They give different options that either include baggage or don't. No matter which option you choose they send messages saying you didn't pay for checked in bags. The first time I believed i was allowed 2 bags. My excess baggage fee was $300 for my wife and I. The last time, I purchased the extra baggage thinking i had no bags. Paid $75 extra for 2 bags each. Then they said oh you didn't need that, your bags are included. But a message was sent to me saying that if i needed to check a bag, I needed to purchase it. I have really had my fill of their stupidity. And they are never on time.",1
Penang to Singapore. Really positive customer service experience. I was unable to fly due to medical grounds and the customer service representative was very professional and helpful. She guided me through a refund experience that would have been complicated at other airlines. Scoot made it easy and seamless. I was very impressed with my correspondence with her.,0
We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asias office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you uncheck them. Boarding in BKK was a case of first rush first aboard. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,1
"Sydney to Gold Coast. My flight has been cancelled at last moment due to weather, it is understandable. But after waiting at airport counter, they were not able to give another flight for next 4 days. And offered Qantas voucher with life time validity. Then after a week, I received a Jetstar voucher with only 6 month validity. I am not a regular domestic traveler , so it is same as no refund.",1
Business class was wonderful except for the meals and any drinks had to be brought including water. The inflight entertainment was limited and if you didn't book it with your flight you could not request it once you got to the plane as they only allow enough for the pre booked entertainment. The seating and value for money was wonderful and the 8 hour flight went very quickly. I would recommend that you eat well before going on the flight and you will be very happy with everything else.,0
"Lombok to Denpasar Bali. I wished I'd read the reviews of this sorry excuse for an airline before I bought tickets. The reviews here are bang on. For what is about a 25 minute flight from LOP to DPS, they managed to delay a March 9 mid-morning flight by 4 hours for ""operational"" reasons and for a ""runway inspection"" by local authorities. Have never heard that one before. The operational issues seem to start at the top of the organization given that these delays are more the norm than the exception. (Our flight from DPS to LOP was also delayed by an hour.) The cabin crew seem genuinely disinterested and issue only the standard sorry apology but no mention of any kind of compensation or even any food or beverage during the delay. We will never fly them again and will let everybody within earshot know why. This company can't possibly go out of business fast enough. As an aside, we found it amusing that they advertise their 'door to door' parcel service on the seat backs. Who in their right mind would engage this company to deliver packages when they treat people with such disdain?",1
"Manila to Caticlan. I agree with many customers they said long time ago Cebu Pacific was a good airline, but nowadays more and more troubles.  Our flight Manila to Caticlan DG 6241 was cancelled, said we'll get next DG 6243 flight 2hours later, but this one cancelled too - instead we got a 5.5 hrs later flight to Kalibo instead booked flight to Caticlan, which is more inconvenient for us to go to Boracay, and its a cheaper flight too. We reached the island at 11pm, half day holiday was lost. We wanted a refund amount, because flights to Kalibo are more cheaper, but the customer service wrote: Our flight disruption policy only includes, rebooking within 30 days without charges, full travel fund, or full refund. We cannot do both at the same time. And this seems to happens often. So they sell many more expensive flights at good day times, cancel and change this flights and if you have to take another (cheaper) flight the same day, you don't get a cash refund. This is an unfair customer treatment, even I would say an unjustified income for Cebu Pacific. I only can advise people, if they can afford, to take an even more expensive but hassel free flight with another company.",1
"Varanasi to Amritsar via Delhi with IndiGo. Four domestic flights in India, ranging in length from one to three hours. The planes are clean and fly on time. The cabin crew are kept very busy, so don't have a lot of time to be friendly to passengers. In most cases boarding and disembarking is via a bus, but it's pretty well organised. (There was only one chaotic boarding experience, when the airline was trying to make up lost time due to a late arriving inbound flight.) The seats offer reasonable legroom. We prepaid the Prime package - with extra baggage, seat selection and a snack and drink - and found that this worked very well on all four flights. All in all, this is a nice way to fly within India.",0
"One of the worst airlines I have ever had to deal with. They make up rules along the way specifically designed to take your money. They have a useless BOT and good luck trying to talk to a human being and get anything done. Disgusted! Beginning of Pandemic I was worried and they gave me two options when I tried to cancel, re-book or a travel fund. I chose the travel fund. Now 2 years later I ask for a refund, they say no because you cancelled the flight not us! Not at all happy but I try to be flexible. A friend is going home to the Philippines she is happy to use the fund BUT NO - the original booker MUST be part of the booking and on the flight? Because they just want to take your money. You can't talk with a person only a useless BOT. When you do get an email from a real life person your reply goes to a general mailbox and no one ever reads it. Seriously I will never fly with this airline again.",1
SYD-SIN-SYD in Oct 2012. Surprised that for the fare we paid we received so much. Flights were within 30 minutes of schedule at all times. The seats (Yellow seats $25AUD more) were very good. I am 6ft3 yet I fit very easily and had plenty of room to stretch my legs under the seat in front. Fully aware that there was no IFE so we took our own. Meals were very average but that is not too surprising. Staff were obviously young and inexperienced however they provided all that was required and were always smiling. The price of drinks etc was not too bad. Airport check in at Sydney was quite lengthy but at Singapore was really quick. It is important to remember that it is a low cost carrier.,0
Flew from AKL-CHC and had a very nice flight. Our plane had relatively new seating which was comfortable. Legroom was acceptable and the crew were friendly and efficient. Online Check-In worked well and allowed us to avoid the queues to drop off our bags. Overall I highly recommend.,0
IndiGo are a low cost airline and as such are prone to delays. This flight left 40 mins late. Being only an ATR we couldnt climb above the clouds making it a fairly uncomfortable flight. Its a pay service although they do give you a free small bottle of water which strangely was handed out as we got off. Seats dont recline. IndiGo style themselves as a funky airline and so their crew were badges with phrases such as leading lady or Miss IndiGo. I would use them again as I think they are probably Indias best low cost airline.,0
"Hyderabad to Sharjah. Shortly after boarding the above flight I was having dizziness. After 2 hrs of boarding, I realized the vomiting sensation & was prepared to use the Toilet & in front of Toilet I collapsed like a Blackout. However, the flight crew done everything by calmly and professionally organizing medical attention. Cabin crew made an announcement to other Co passengers, if any Dr available to take care of him and luckily Dr was available & he checked everything & made me more comfortable. Indigo is indeed a very professional and caring organization.",0
Flight JQ151 SYD to CHC on 12th March - seats 5 A and B. Great check in at SYD polite and friendly staff no queues and all done with smiles and a minimum of fuss. Two bags checked in and no issues with weight or size though one was on the button and the other just under. Flight on time and the seat next to us was free bonus. The cabin manager was on his game polite friendly welcoming and very smartly turned out. The other crew equally so and the atmosphere on board was one of calm and professionalism. Smooth take off not a word from the Captain but prompt service one we levelled off and again swift friendly and professional. Given the hour of the flight the Cabin Manager was smart enough to realize that most people were wanting to doze and there was minimum noise and disruption from the crew in respect to announcements or endless trips up and down the aisle as sometimes mysteriously happens on night flights. Arrived early into Christchurch and left the aircraft with a heartfelt thanks from the crew and a cheery good night. Great flight from Jetstar - this is our fifth International service and all are up there with the mainline carriers at about a quarter of the price.,0
"Manila to Bacolod with Cebu Pacific. They notified me thru email that my return flight will be cancelled / delayed, and they booked me to the next flight (this is a good touch which I did not expect). I had to cancel and ask for refund which they did promptly. I only had to cancel because it was going to affect my next international flight. I was very pleased with initiative and pro-activeness which gave me time to change my plans.",0
"The worst of experiences you can face on and off a flight due to an airline. Absolutely pathetic service. Cancelling flights without notice. And then asking you travell to other airports in order for me to catch my connecting flight, that too without any hesitance or apology. The staff on and off the airplane is same as their service maybe barring a few. My luggage didn't arrive as well to Melbourne. My seat was booked for some other passenger as well, meaning they issued 2 boarding passes for 1 seat. The same happened with my friend travelling with me. They charge you the money first and immediately say, sorry we don't have what you ordered can i provide something else. In a international flight of 13 hrs (including connection), there was no option of having a meal on board( when booked through 3rd party) and when you ask for food during the flight, it will definitely take more than an hour to serve you. The staff handling the luggage was on the same line unapologetic and rude. Told me this is normal. Its a disgrace for other airlines to be sharing pathways with this terrible airline. They did not even have the courtesy to change my seat when i continuously complained about my back pain, even for extra money. The thing they just don't want to serve you. When i told them that i cannot board a flight to some airport and then take a cab to Melbourne to catch the connecting flight. Neither did they agree to pay for fare i had to pay neither did they assure me that the flight wont leave without me if i could not manage everything in 2 hrs. Horrible experience, i hope no one has to go through what i had to. And lastly the fare was more than Emirates to start with, without meals and deducting money before they tell you they dont have what you want. On top of that asking me to pay for even a song to listen let alone movies or shows.",1
"The Boeing 787 was comfortable and clean. Legroom is pretty good for a budget airline. Plane left on time from Perth and return flight from Singapore was about 20 minutes late only due to busy time of day at Changi. Staff were professional and pleasant on both flights. Food is hit and miss depending on what you order. If you want to have a meal it is best to pre-order as the food service is a bit slow, plus they serve all the pre-order meals first. There was no entertainment, (an app like Virgin Australia would be good), so bring your iPad or a good book. $12 USD / hour for wifi service is a bit steep. Have to agree about the service / light button on the armrest, I kept turning it on by accident. The dimmer button for the windows is a great feature. Also refill your empty water bottle in the Changi boarding lounge for the return flight. Overall no worse than other budget airlines, I would fly Scoot again.",0
I travelled with Cebu for an internal flight in the Philippines back in July 2019. I rebooked with them for a flight from Melbourne to Manila for Dec/Jan 2019/2020. I had to cancel my flight due to personal reasons. Instead of giving me a refund Cebu gave me a credit note that I had to use within 3 months. When I rang them and explained my need to cancel I got the usual terms and conditions excuse and they refused to refund me my fare. When Cebu had the opportunity to act with compassion and fairness they chose not to. This is unacceptable from Cebu.,1
"I thought I knew what I was buying, a ticket for a very reasonable price - especially with carry-on only - on a low-cost airline, so I didn't really have expectations. However, this was my first time travelling long-distance on such an airline and not the usual max. 2-hr flights. And this made a huge difference. My seat was 4J, in the front, by the window, close to the toilet, but not too close. This was all fine. But an 8+ hr long flight with 7 restrooms only, for 436 seats, probably not enough. The quality of the seats, the restrooms were so worn-off and broken that I didn't really feel comfortable (though I'm not picky at all, but the restroom was a real experience towards the end of the flight). No entertainment (TV or music), of course, seats are not too comfortable either, but at least you can order food on board. Pretty limited selection in food unless you pre-order (strongly advised), drinks, snacks...but as it happened in my case, only 2 machines to pay by card, in my case BOTH broken. No local peso with me (why, if I'm flying out), and no USD (why, if I'm European, travelling home). Since we figured this out after my order of coffee, after a little while, I was told, it was on the company, but a few hours later I was thirsty and hungry, so I asked about opportunities to get a noodle pack and water. Since they said the company likely won't allow it, the flight attendants shared their own meal pack with me (noodle pack) and I got from their water. Interesting approach from the airline, but a huge thanks to the crew. Only a question, how come nobody checked the machines before taking off? (I flew with Cebu from Saigon to Manila before, short enough flight, so on shorter distance, I would probably take them again, but I would suggest / consider other options for 3+ hr flights).",0
"Completely unprofessional. Arrived on time for my international flight to Japan, waiting in line and got a text, flight cancelled. Rebooked in 24 hours. I have accommodation booked, hire to pick up. Just because they can not organise the crew for the international flight. Hopefully I will fly tomorrow, but I will never book another flight with Jetstar.",1
"Singapore to Melbourne. Yesterday Jetstar informed us that our 22:50 flight to Melbourne was rescheduled to 07:30 the following day due to maintenance issues. Thankfully my 5 year old daughter and myself were staying in the same room as my husband who was travelling for business, but we had to pay an extra $90 for the additional night for the rollaway bed for her. So we wake up at 3:30am today, wait and wait and wait and 30 minutes before the plane is scheduled to depart, there is no sign of the plane. Everyone was left wondering without any word from jetstar. Thirty minutes after the expected departure, the Captain announced that there will be an additional 3 hour delay. We had all been security screened at Gate D34, and will need to repeat the process again when the next gate is selected. We were told that there were $20 food vouchers available only at Burger King (again the same as last night). Apparently as a customer, our lost time is not valuable at all. You have failed us in your offering Jetstar and this is not satisfactory at all. Will not be flying with you again",1
"Singapore to Trivandrum. I missed my Scoot flight to Trivandrum. I opted a wheelchair as I had physical issues. A lady assistant who took me from the Singapore airlines informed that my flight was delayed and that I'll be taken to the correct gate later. I waited for someone to guide me. As no one came to assist me for a long time, I enquired and realized that my flight was on time and I had missed the flight. I spend 24hrs in the airport. They accommodation they gave was available only for few hours. They provided me meal vouchers and next day's flight ticket. I regret booking this trip. I had to call both the airlines back and forth for all my clarifications, which was very frustrating.",1
SYD - KUL - PEN - SIN. Was nervous about using a budget carrier but need not have been. SYD - KUL loads of spare seats around us at rear of plane. Samsung tablet provided decent entertainment. Food was as expected. KUL - PEN was delayed around 90 minutes with no announcement or board notice of when we would actually depart which was a little frustrating. Both KUL - PEN and PEN - SIN flights were cramped but for short flights at a bargain cost who cares. Will happily fly them again.,0
"Manila to Cebu, and I recommend not to fly with Cebu Pecific. It is totally unreliable. I had a massive delay without any information whatsoever. The staff was hiding, the ground crew gave no information on the nature and the time of the delay. I recommend to use other local carriers for domestic flights.",1
"Flew AirAsia, AK715 back home after a day trip in KL. The check-in queues were unexpectedly long although at least the check-in process was fast and I got my boarding pass easily. The flight was on time, seat was comfortable and the cabin was clean. Varity of food and drinks were sold onboard the flight. Overall, I enjoyed this flight experience.",0
My flight from Darwin to Singapore got delayed but I managed to clear immigration and got to the ticket counter more than an hour ago of my flight schedule time but i found out that Indigo closed their counters around 15 minutes prior the usual time and I missed my flight. Airport staff was surprised by the fact that how can they close their counter this early they tried their best to contact the airline to help me but no one picked up the phone.  I lost my flight and had to book another flight which cost me extra $500 also made me lose my friends wedding which was sole reason i booked this trip. I had to wait for almost 10 hours for my next flight and took me the whole next day in travel to get to my destination.,1
SYD-HBA-SYD in economy row 1 bulkhead. I'm a QFF silver and was again impressed by just how good JQ can be for LCC. Efficiently boarded & pushed back right on time (each sector). Row 1 bulkhead/partition seats were a good choice for a day flight. No IFE or free snack service but not needed. Clean aircraft. However it does take more effort to monitor a JQ booking for schedule changes and cancellations.,0
Staff were aggressive and rude. All customers were advised  you wont be getting on this flight unless you weigh in your hand luggage in an aggressive intimidating manner. Customers were charged $65 for being a few kilos over. The back half of the plane have to board by stairs however due to a knee injury I boarded by the air bridge and were confronted by the rudest flight attendant who was only concerned of following the rules and didnt want to hear my issue - she basically talked over me.,1
Bangalore to Mumbai good quality from this budget airline. Flight on time leg room good and boarding a breeze. I will use IndiGo Airlines as it is value for money.,0
Singapore-Gold Coast Oct 11th. Departed and arrived 10 min late due to Tech fault. Check in reasonable although strange - check in staff collect passports whilst waiting in check in line and take to document counter for processing then return to pass and direct you to check in counter. This in my opinion slows down check in. Meal service started 1.5hrs after take off pre booked meals served first however they start from row 21 and take a further 1.5hrs to reach seat 61 where I sat - the meal was cold and inedible. Economy blue seats leg room okay however I paid extra for Super seat (well worth the payment). Rows 61-64 are definitely the best - a larger seat and more leg room than other Super seat. Apart from food a good budget airline. Staff extremely professional.,0
"Super late - due to mechanical issues, sat on tarmac for three hours before finally deplaning at 1:30 am and told that we need to wait until at least 3:30 am for our flight. Given crackers and water on the plane. My flight to Manila from Dubai was also late, causing me to miss my next flight. The cheap prices arent worth the inconvenience and waste of my time.",1
Travelled from the Gold Coast to Cairns with Jetstar. I love the Gold Coast airport as it is small and you cannot get lost. Had a Burger King breakfast which was nothing special. The flight was uneventful. We had to board via walking across tarmac but that was no problem. I like flying Jetstar whenever I can.,0
"Delhi to Singapore. Today was such an amazing experience with IndiGo, My nephew Who is Singaporean traveled as an unaccompanied minor, the staff was really really helpful, he offered him such an amazing experience. I just want to thank Nihal  for making our new year special & Good bless him & his hard work.",0
"Denpasar to Melbourne. The flight left and arrived pretty much on time. Our family sat in rows 11 and 12 (row 13 does not have windows). The seats were comfortable, but if I fly longhaul again with Jetstar I will bring my own pillow as I couldn't get comfortable to sleep. The crew were Asian (Thai),  were friendly enough and did their job. We didn't bother with meals as the flight left at 11:15pm and arrived at 6:40am and they had the dame dinner options for breakfast. By the time we fought through immigration at MEL, our bags were waiting on the carousel. There were 4 complaints which put me off Jetstar: We had our luggage and hand luggage searched / screened twice by Airport officials, but Jetstar had their staff search people's hand luggage for 'liquids' before allowing passengers into the gate. What they were really doing was taking people's duty free alcohol that they had bought in the airport.  When I was considering purchasing meals for breakfast, I was unable to select the second (breakfast) service. Breakfast options were the same as dinner - why not put on some breakfast options. I will likely fly with Jetstar shorthaul at some stage, (I will give preference to Qantas / Virgin) but for 3hrs + I will stick to a full service airline in the future. You do need to purchase your luggage, entertainment and meals. I would recommend doing this when you book your ticket to save money. We booked more luggage than we ended up needing at a reasonable price. I would recommend choosing seats in the front sections in rows 11 and 12. If you want water on the flight don't stress - bring your water bottle and the crew will fill it for you free as you need it during the flight.",0
"I travelled from Singapore to Hyderabad on August 1st. I left my bag on aeroplane, hen i informed to the staff through their customer service they didn't even pay a minimum attention and did not consider the issue. The staff was very reluctant about the issue",1
"Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur. My last experience with AirAsia was way back in 2012 to Sabah. This time, for a 1 hour flight I could say that I'm quite impressed. Ground service was good, even though I used self check in, staff assisted me in putting on my baggage tag. They redirected me smoothly and was quite helpful when I encountered a problem. This time around, I took this opportunity to survey on ""Allstars"", something which AirAsia is proud about and I wanted to see it for myself. Upon boarding, flight attendant greeted warmly, safety procedures were done (flight attendant did not smile, at least she looks serious), one passenger made a fuss and the stewardess handled it quickly and efficiently. Flight experience was good, take-off was smooth and views were fantastic. Even saw a rainbow for a moment over the clouds! I pre-ordered a meal and when I had some left over, they offered to tapao (take away) for me! Kudos for the Malaysian slang. Had two kids sitting next to me, so I helped them fasten their seatbelts, steward thanked me with a smile(I did not expect that!) Unfortunately, Roki was not working so in flight entertainment is boring. Landing was good, flight on time and had 2 captains for that flight. Overall experience was amazing for an LCC. Highly recommended!",0
"Melboune to Sydney. I buy tickets for seat 1E and check in online already, but when she scan my ticket and she didnt say anything to me, and give me new seat that time I didnt see yet. When i go on airplane staff tell me seat on 5F, I said but I pay $13 and check in already,. She just said she dont know  - how can i ask any question?  I think jetstar need to pay money me back, because I pay for seat on front but she give me seat 5F.",0
Sydney to Singapore. The check-in was quick and left on time. Cabin crew cheerful and energetic. I did not select anything to eat when I booked the tickets but ordered from foods available on menu inflight. The hot Italian veggie food was tasty and filling - about 8 AUD which is quite cheap. I found their menu to be reasonably priced. The leg space was sufficient. I observed that leg space of some seats (yellow) for which you need to pay extra was large especially the first row. When you book online you have options of paying by credit card or through POLI using your bank account. I chose the second option of going through bank and had to wait for more than 24 hrs for the bank transfer to complete and ticket delivered. I also had to do few follow-ups with their customer centre. If people are travelling within the next 2 or 3 days of booking I suggest to use credit-card which should result in a ticket immediately. Overall very satisfied with my first experience with Scoot and happy that I saved about $A350 for my one- way trip to Singapore by booking Scoot.,0
"Jakarta to Bengkulu. Based on price for the one hour 10 minute trip. The airplane was all one class, reminded me of Southwest in the US, however, the inside of the airplane was an advertising board for their package delivery service, it kind of was all over. In any case, the checking in, boarding was fine. The seats a little narrow, but then I am not the size of what I saw to be the average Indonesian. It was narrow but not uncomfortable and for the short trip it was not a big to do. Service was fine, we left on time arrived on time and I received my luggage without problems. The announcements were done in English and Bahasa Indonesian and well, the English was a bit difficult to understand when it was not pre recorded. All in all the experience and product was fine.",0
DEL-BKK on newly introduced international service by Indigo. Clean aircraft everything BOB on time and professional crew. Not very different from domestic services the only difference that food is priced in USD. The highlight was great value fare booked well in advance.,0
I was meant to get the 09:10 flight from Wellington to Auckland and then would have a 4 hour wait to catch an international flight back to the UK. I turned up at the airport just before 7am and was told the flight had been cancelled that morning and I'd have to go on standby for a flight that would arrive in Auckland at 12:50. I advised this would be impossible as I'd miss my international flight. After a lot of talking the lady of the checkin desk managed to get me on the standby flight that should have left at 08:35 but was late and eventually left at my originally scheduled flight time of 09:10. I had 5 mins to get to the gate and through security. I was grateful to get the flight but very unhappy with the lack of communication from Jetstar Airways leading to the cancellation of the flight. Lots of other passengers who also turned up for the cancelled flight stated they had not received any cancellation texts or emails. One person stated they received the message at approximately 5am. The plane itself had good leg room on the seats and the luggage came out promptly on arrival. I would hesitate using Jetstar Airways again.,1
"Cebu to Caticlan. Worst flight company ever. I booked four different flights with them on January 2018 and all of them were delayed of at least one hour. Don't book with them, trust me, you would rather prefer spend your money with another company and not waste them. We had to book several accommodations because of them.",1
"First of all, our flight from Sydney to Townsville was changed with no notification from Jetstar. We had originally booked an 11.30am direct flight but were moved to the red eye. When leaving Townsville our direct flights were also changed to a connecting flight through Brisbane. I asked the lady in Townsville if I could purchase a check in luggage. I had to pay twice for the bag (from Townsville to Brisbane and Brisbane to Sydney) and I also had to collect my bag in Brisbane and recheck it in to get to Sydney. I asked the girl if it could go all the way to Sydney and she replied 'we only work port to port and don't do transfers'. What airline sells connecting flights but doesn't transfer the luggage? You can travel through 5 different countries and not have to touch your bags until your final destination all over Europe, but this airline is incapable of arranging a transfer from Brisbane to Sydney. Absolute joke! Especially because my flights were changed by Jetstar and no compensation was given. Even though they appear cheaper they get you with all the additional costs it ends up costing more than other airlines! Not to mention the 'Cheese and Ham Toastie' I got on the flight was soggy.",1
"Plane both left Berlin and arrived at Singapore over an hour late. As bare-bones a budget flight as they come. Seats thin, stiff and uncomfortable. No debit cards accepted on board so couldn't purchase anything. Not even shared monitors to show the plane's progress on such a long-distance flight. Even to watch the paid entertainment program you must download an app and watch them on your own cell phone or other device. The only positives: ever-present polite Asian crew and generous free hand luggage allowance.",0
"Flying with Jetstar was an absolute nightmare. I flew from Perth to Cairns for a few days and they left my baggage in Perth. First they told me I'd be getting my baggage the next day- which I thought was reasonable. Now, they're telling me that they can't do anything about it and that my baggage will only come the day before I'm due to leave Cairns. All they said was that they will reimburse me the money I need to get new clothes and toiletries - when I send them the receipts. Firstly, my chargers are all in my baggage and my electronics are dying. Secondly, I only have a mere few days here and buying new toiletries wasn't on my itinerary. In fact, I don't even have time for it. Jetstar managed to screw my whole week up just because of their incompetence. It's not about the money I need to spend buying new things, it's the time that I don't have. Why should I have to suffer for their negligence. After calling them, which they clearly did not take me seriously, all the operator could say was ""we can't do anything"". The operator was unhelpful and snobbish. I am not after the compensation, I just wanted to know how they are able to help. Such cases have happened to me and I received my baggage within 24 hours (Singapore Airlines). I am now currently stuck in Cairns with nothing but a phone and a dying laptop and my whole trip ruined, while they insist on not providing any other help. Jetstar might have cheap ticket prices, but I assure you it is not worth ruining your trip for. The time I have to spend going around buying necessities could've been used for doing more productive things.",1
"My experience with Jetstar was not a good one from the beginning. I had vouchers to use but Jetstar made it so difficult and complicated to redeem them that I had to eventually pay a travel agent to do it for me. The vouchers had been paid to fly to Thailand but when I went to redeem them they didn't even get me to Bali. The flight was 2 hours late in leaving, the staff on the plane were adequate. I was happy we were on a Dreamliner 787 for all the good features it delivers. I paid extra for an exit row so I could stand up and avoid a third DVT. In fact the knowledge that I could fly on a 787 both ways confirmed that I would go to Bali. On the return trip, Jetstar changed the aircraft to a A321LR Neo, a narrow bodied smaller plane with no entertainment and a minimum of space to stand and exercise. All previous seat booking disappeared so I tried to again book exit rows. The Jetstar webpage interface was so unaccommodating that it was difficult to execute this so I missed out on the two that were available. I think it is pertinent that I wouldn't even have known the plane had changed except that my travel agent had sent me an email. I received nothing from Jetstar. When I finally did books some seats and Jetstar emailed me my new itinerary, it indicated that I now had no checked luggage even though I had paid for it. As it turned out other people were sent the same information but none of us new it was going to be ok. I tried to contact Jetstar on their website chat, but after 20 mins waiting I gave up, but I'm sure I'm important to them. The plane was also 2 hours late in leaving Bali because it was 2 hours late in arriving from Australia. The plane was crowded but the seats were unexpectedly comfortable. This service would not be tolerated without fines in other parts of the world. Next week I fly Virgin, I'm hoping for a better flight.",1
"They cancelled my ticket one week in advance on an international trip and when I pushed them to book me on another flight, they booked me on another flight but denied boarding to me at the airport and then pushed me to take a refund which I have still not received after 1 week. I had to book a long distance flight for 2 people from the airport which costed a lot more than my original ticket.",1
Bangalore to Singapore on 17th Aug 2018. The gap between the seats in this flight was barely 6. When I sat my knees kept rubbing on the back of the seat in front of me. This was a midnight flight and 4.5hour long. I can say this was the most uncomfortable experience I have had flying.  We certainly will recommend scoot on this sector based our bad seating experience,1
"The airline known as AirAsia is the most unsatisfactory flight company I've ever dealt with. They consistently come up with excuses to extract extra money from customers, even resorting to underhanded tactics to coerce additional ticket purchases, as explained in the instances below. Using AirAsia is a major warning sign; it's essential to be cautious with this deceptive company. This marks the second time in a week that I've had an incredibly unpleasant encounter with AirAsia. During the previous flight from Penang to Langkawi, they refused to check in our luggage, citing our arrival 45 minutes past the departure time. Despite being at the KLIA2 counter two hours in advance, successfully checking in our luggage, and passing the hand carry luggage check this time, they insisted on an additional 15 kg. However, at the counter, they refused to add the luggage, once again using the 45-minute rule as an excuse.The staff's impoliteness led to us missing the Miri flight, and we had to secure an alternative flight through Malaysian Airlines. This will be our last experience with the so-called air flight company, AirAsia, making it the most absurd encounter I've ever had with an airline in my life.",1
"A better experience on Scoot than my trip with Singapore Airlines. The plane is quite new and has excellent facilities. The seats, cabin and toilets are clean. Scoot crew somehow provide better service than my Singapore Airlines flight. I had a great experience flying Scoot despite being no frills.",0
"Guangzhou to Singapore. Worst flying experience ever. They charged USD 725 during the covid19 time to profit from those who have to fly and even at this price still without regular luggage allowance. I have to call them multiple times to buy additional allowance for my second piece of luggage and it turned out to be a nightmare. Rep is very hard to communicate, slow, and poor in English. It ended up with I failed to buy proper allowance without knowing it, and I was fined a lot at the airport.",1
"Sydney To Brisbane. So far lately I have not had any disruption from Jetstar and with this latest flight I thought they deserve some positivity. Check In was efficient followed by security, I find them more clueless than frequent flyers and most likely need more training. Boarding was slightly delayed because of baggage restriction being imposed on passengers who have gone over their limit. The cabin crew were mediocre, but being an LLC that's the standard. Arrival was early plus by the time I reached the arrivals hall my luggage was ready for collection, by far the fastest experience I have come across. Keep up the good work.",0
Manila to Phuket via Singapore. Hit with hundreds of dollars of overage fees on two carry-on bags we had to check because my friend and I booked our ticket in one reservation instead of separately. So 2 of us only get the checked bag allowance of one person (and the ticket costs the same as if we would have booked separately). This is not clearly explained when you book or confirm. Its a scam to get more money and they should be ashamed of themselves.,1
"Gold Coast to Auckland. Probably the worst flying experience in 50 years of travelling! Staff rude and arrogant, paid extra $$ for luggage to be told as I was slightly over there would be a $225 excess charge and not to try to swap goods from suitcase to hand luggage to swap weight as hand luggage would be weighed at boarding and if heavier would be confiscated!  Paid extra for front row extra legroom that wasn't in system.",1
Flight was scheduled to depart at 7.05pm and was retimed to 7.30pm. Then it was retimed to 8.10pm 3. It is currently 8.05pm and we have been told that it's now retimed to 9pm. Very well timed as this does not place them liable for any damages.,1
CGK-SIN-CGK. The seat was terrible with very little leg room the FA's disappeared during the flight no presence at all and the toilet was dirty. On the way back to Jakarta the air conditioner was extremely cold however the mood lighting gave a little comfort and that was the only positive thing I took from the flight.,1
"Comfortable business class ""flatbeds"" on longer legs of trip - service good - usually depart and arrive on time. Staff usually very friendly and accommodating but this last trip (Sydney/KUL/CNX) staff were a bit on the reserved side. This is unusual even with the short flights I have taken with Air Asia as well as some other business class flights. My rating for inflight entertainment was 3 out of 5 because one needs to purchase the entertainment separately and I did not use it as I was travelling overnight. Generally and for the most part I would recommend flying Air Asia.",0
So we accidentally booked extra weight and did put and credit card or debit card and didn't pay for it. At Sydney airport they made us pay 100 aus saying we didn't pay for it as we didn't use the weight and the staff of cebu pacific said we would get our money back as we land in Manila. In a normal case they should have given us our money back but they didn't and said there staff at Sydney airport misguided us and never paid us back the money.,1
Shopping around I found that there was an excellent promotion fare with TAA from SIN to CNX. I used this service on day one in January and hoped that they could at least get it back to CNX on time. The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.,0
SYD-ADL. Quite pricey for the tickets as there are other hidden fees such as online booking fees and credit card fees which aren't included in the advertised price. Boarded the old and worn A320 about 45 minutes late and waited another 30 minutes before we began to taxi for take-off. No in-flight entertainment unless you want to pay money to rent an iPad. No leg room and zero recline. Arrived quite late and only got an apology from the flight stewardess which was nice. Overall not too bad for the price you paid but trust me there are better flights out there for just a few extra bucks.,1
"The check-in line hasn't moved for 30 minutes now because they only opened one counter for Clark, whereas most of the counters for Manila are open. It's also disorganized. Our departure is at 1:15 pm, and it's already 12 pm, but we're still in line. Some Cebu Pacific personnel are just standing around, which is disappointing. They are so rude too. I wouldn't choose this airline again!",1
We flew Sydney to Hobart. The good news: the flight was on time. The bad news: the seats were just as uncomfortable as those on sister airline Qantas.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Check-in went well, as there are many self check-in machines in the KLIA2 airport. Boarding was relatively on-time and there was no issue. The best part is when landing in Jakarta, since Airasia is now operating in the new airport where they provide better services.",0
TSN-KUL. Left and arrived over 30 minutes early. Inflight meal was lovely. KUL-OOL - left early but held up on tarmac. No inflight service used. Seating configuration 3-3-3. Believe seats were narrower aisles definitely narrower and unsure if leg room was less. Check-in was prompt and courteous with no wait for luggage. Found cabins a little cool so need a coat or blanket on long haul. LCCC has everything required but don't expect a top international terminal and credit cards were not taken.,0
"Melbourne to Bali. Its cheaper to go with an airline that offers luggage and meal for a family. They charge an arm and a leg for luggage but the problem is You have to purchase luggage both ways if you have purchased a return ticket. I purchased a return flight from Melbourne to Bali, on departure  I added on luggage 25kgs thinking this will also be added on my return? No it didn't, you have to pay extra for luggage on return ""how ridiculous is that"" because its a family off 5 i had to purchase 5x luggage going to bali and then 5x luggage returning home from bali. Do the math its cheaper to fly with another airline that offers all. After my flights I'm still being charged for inflight meals the problem is I can't speak to any humans about these false charges that jetstar is taking out from my credit card, you have to email back and forth to get your complaint heard or dealt with. My return flights was in March 2018 it is now the end of April and jetstar is charging my credit card for inflight meals even though it was paid in full at the time off my flights. I'm still waiting for my refund and hope Jetstar will erase my credit card details off there system. The food was horrible but because i had 3 kids i had no choice but to purchase meals. I will never use Jetstar again that was the first and last.",1
"This airline is worst than Ryanair. It's not disabled friendly. The bus that transports you to aircraft sits very high. The ramp is extremely steep and the airlines lacks a lot for the handicapped. The airline is low cost which is understandable, but not when it comes to the very basic of comfort. The cabin crew do their job, but don't expect them to be friendly or sympathize with the elderly or disabled.",1
Singapore to Ho Chi Minh return A320. Group check in was fairly quick. Short flight so no IFE and no food was not a problem. Early arrival in HCM meant a wait for an available parking space (not really the airline's fault). Crew really observant during take-off and landing which is good. Very cheap prices and will not hesitate to fly Jetstar again for short flights.,0
"This is the worst company I traveled with on my world tour. Staff, comfort, organisation, late. Nothing good to say. Very disappointed. I tried twice, wont had a third.",1
"We had booked our return ticket from Bali to Delhi via Kuala Lumpur at 1.30 pm on Jan 8th 2023. We get a sms which states the flight is preponed to 7am reason not known. Our flight to India is scheduled at 7pm, no other flight before that. We are forced to stay in Kuala Lumpur airport till 7pm. Thank you AirAsia for totally screwing the entire day for no genuine reason.",1
I've flown with Air Asia often last time at NYE next time 19th January. Flights are usually on time some delays of 30 mins sometimes but never had my flight cancelled. The attendants are friendly and the aircraft is clean. If you manage to plan ahead you can get really good promotions. Overall good service mainly considering you are flying a low budget airline.,0
Not that I expect much from LCCs however my Lion Air flight from Bali to Yogyakarta was Bad. Terrible online system. Difficult to make payment with non-Indonesian credit card. Cannot select seats online and no online check-in. Disorganized at airport in Bali where they basically re-entered all the data while checking in. Delayed flights. Onboard the absolute smallest legroom I've ever seen. Thankfully there are some positives as well: they have new 737-900ER's with Sky Interiors the flights are short and cheap and flight attendants have nice uniforms accompanied by wonderful smiles. For the rest they have a lot of work to do to be able to compete with Air Asia.,1
Flew to Gold Coast in mid Dec. Pre-booked and paid for inflight entertainment but this service was 'pulled out due to operational constraint'. Instead of giving us a full cash refund for non-provision of service we were offered a $20 voucher valid until 30 Jun 2013 for 'additional baggage allowance and meal or to upgrade your seats for your future flight'. In response to my request for cash refund I was told to note that the vouchers were transferable. We have no plans to travel before 30 Jun and are definitely unlikely to fly Scoot again!,1
Using super old plane. Aircon was blowing warm air and the whole cabin is like sauna. Everyone is flipping for air using the airline safety cardboard. A disgrace to Singapore airline,1
Bangkok to Krabi. My friend and I paid for return flights and hold luggage. We could not check in on-line for the return journey as their website was not working and when we got to the airport we were told we had not paid for hold luggage. Despite showing a receipt they made us pay THB 3900 and THB 3000 on our debit and credit cards or we could not fly. We both felt totally humiliated and it ruined a good holiday to end it that way. I will never fly with this airline again!,1
"My review lays with being periodically harassed and ridiculed about an extension seat belt. Being that I am a plus size woman, I already came prepared and brought/bought my own seat belt extender that fit and connected the first flight to Narita no issues about the seat belt extender, however, there were still multiple times of being awaken out my sleep to pull an arm rest down or not have anything in my lap. Back to the initial complaint, on flight ZG026 to San Francisco on 9/18/23. I got to my seat and I over heard the flight attendants that did not wear name badges, speaking in Japanese about of have to make sure the fat lady has a seat belt extender. This the behavior you allow for your company. Then one comes up to me and pulls the seat belt and extends it then says you need an extender. Not ask but stated that I needed one. Still remaining calm I told her I already have one of my own and proceed to click it to get her smoothly. She leaves and talk with the previous attendant that was talking bad about me and comes back saying its not safe for me to use my own seatbelt extender belt. Then shoves theirs in my hand and says be sure to give this back at the end of flight and stayed until I removed mine and connected theirs to the seat belt. The attendant walks off says something else that I could not fully hear but definitely heard Im going to mark her seat down so she doesnt steals it to the previous attendant they both laugh. I proceeded to state I really dont need this extension belt and you two are making me uncomfortable and we havent even taken off. They lie and says its policy and then walk off. Fast forward to 2/3 of the flight nearly ending the same attendant wakes me out of my sleep to tell me dont forget to leave the extension belt in the seat when I leave. I calmly say ok even though I am boiling because of the assumption of assuming that Im going to steal a extension belt extender, then when we land and the seatbelt light is off. I took off the seat belt and detached everything and left in the seat. The same harassing attendant comes up to me and demands I give her the seatbelt extender. I reach behind me and get it for her and said I thought you wanted me to leave it in the seat but please do take note that you have it back in your hands. Because I am not a thief and do not appreciate being harassed like one. I wish they had name plates so I can post it in this review. Lounge in narita was ok, the white seats are extremely stained and theres no restroom inside it. In conclusion, this is the last time flying with ZIPAIR.",1
Australia to Phuket return in Business Class. I have never been so disappointed. I was in seat 4k - when the seat belt sign went off the passenger in front reclined and the space was less than economy. By the time I was able to ask a flight attendant to ask the person in front to move the seat forward a bit they refused as they said he was asleep! The seat pan width was 28 cms to the tray table it was almost impossible to eat and equally impossible to get out. Jetstar Business Class is the worst leg room I have experienced and to have that in a Business Class is unforgivable.,1
"Sydney to Brisbane. Went to Melbourne 2018 March for daughters surprise birthday. From 9am in the morning it kept delaying but luckily got one at around 5 pm. Went again in March 2020. Today 29 March 2922 to Brisbane, so far at time of this post flight delayed for 30 minutes. This company offers very good prices for its flights across the country But one has to be patient for delays with this airline. I will not travel with this airline anymore given their track record for delays, even if i was given free tickets. Pay more for a reputable airline to get you to your destination on time",1
"Melbourne to Bangkok return, and I have flown this route many times - it defies me how Jetstar never get this route on time. They are late to depart, and always the same reasons - late passengers (this is from the airline that invented strict check-in policies), the pilot completing paperwork etc etc. If you track the history of these flight numbers you will see that the average delay is 1 hr. If you look at on-time performance for this route, Thai airways comes in at 95%, Jetstar is around 27%. And to rub salt into the wound, Qantas closed their lounge in Bangkok on 15th November 2015 - so that $300 plus extra fee you pay to enjoy things like the lounge - worthless. They put you in a local airport lounge - but bear in mind anyone can use this at a cost of only $40 - far from worth it.",1
CGK-SIN. 15 minutes delay but it doesn't really matter. Crews were friendly bought nasi lemak onboard and it was delicious. Too bad the announcement was bad because it seems like the announcer didn't know what to speak. Overall a great experience.,0
Brisbane to Sydney. Wont fly with Jetstar again. Delayed by nearly an hour. We all stood waiting in line with no information for 40 minutes before they had the decency to make an announcement that the plane was running late. Charged me $60 because my bag was a smidge over 7kg. Poor airline. Very unhappy.,1
"Melbourne to Denpasar. For under $400 return i was quite happy with the service, but if i was paying closer to $600-$800 which these flights sometimes are, my review would be quite different. Seat was fairly comfortable, but narrow even for someone like myself who is under 170cm. I paid the $26 extra and sat in the forward cabin. Apart from a screaming child on both legs, it was fairly tame compared to the creche in the main cabin. I think they should make the forward cabin free of parents carrying infants as it is only 3 rows and you could probably squeeze a bit more money out of me for the privilege. For a bit under 6 hours to Bali and 4.5 hours I was fairly comfortable but would struggle I think for anything longer. Overall you pay for what you get and for the price I am satisfied.",0
Honolulu to Bali via Sydney. After being told several time we are leaving in an hour they then at 10 am cancelled the flight and told us to come back same time the next day. We did and it happened all over again. We were told to come back at 10 pm that day to leave. This puts us now delayed 75 hours and on top of that we have to get new connection flight from SYD to DPS putting us at the Sydney airport for 12 more hours. I will never fly Jetstar or Qantas again. Jetstar is owed by Qantas and Qantas had 30 open seats but they said we had to by a new ticket with them and did not offer a discount at all. No help what so ever. Talking about horrible customer service.,1
"My daughter and I arrived two minutes after the flight had closed. We'd flown from Manchester on Emirates. The flight had been delayed by 3 hours so it was a miracle to get to check in at all. Although Jetstar have a rigid approach to late arrivals, I was impressed with the staff at Auckland airport who went out of their way to ensure that we were on the next available flight. Thanks so much. I would fly with Jetstar again!",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with AirAsia. A small problem at check in with the wrong seats printed on my boarding pass to what I had originally paid for, but that was easily resolved, the flight was very busy and the ground staff were not the best at dealing with boarding The onboard staff were super.",0
Travelled with Jetstar to Phuket because they flew direct. They were not cheaper than other airlines available at the time just the flight times were good. Everything on this flight came with an extra cost. Food drinks entertainment and even a blanket for our daughter who was feeling cold came at an additional cost. I think Jetstar have poor service and are a rip off. I will not fly again or recommend this airline to others.,1
"Me and my wife were headed for our honeymoon to Maldives (March 4-10, 2021). But despite having all proper documentation (PCR covid, health, etc) we were stopped in Kolkata by Indigo Airlines. They gave us a hellish experience - finding faults and even accusing us of not knowing protocols. I am a frequent international traveller. She didn't even know where our arrival ticket was as it was lying in front of her. She didn't give us any option(s) nor reassurance or help. She was intent on ruining our vacation. My tired wife cried in despair. I dont like to berate somebody online but these kind of people need to be exposed. Such inexperienced and unprofessional airline staff shouldnt be allowed to malign the good name of the company.",1
Impressed by flight FD3932 from Changi Airport to Don Mueang on the night of 5th Dec 2013. No long queue at Terminal 1 check in counter the staff really helpful toward us when I ask to be seat together with older parents. Though the aircraft had just arrived the crew showed no sign of tiredness and were helpful on boarding. Captain made announcement about the weather and greeted us when we started to fly into Thai air space. It's a little things that's count.,0
"Our flight 5J 620 from Bohol to Manila was cancelled because of a short storm that occured the evening before. There was no need to cancel an 8am flight because of a thunderstorm that happened the evening before! Luckily we were reassigned to a 12pm flight later that day so we got home the same day, the flight was smooth but the overall experience was not nice at all! Also heard that there was a flight delayed for 20 hours! Try to avoid Cebu Pacific and get yourself a ticket with a better airline.",1
"Denpasar to Hong Kong via Bangkok. This is my first time flying with Air Asia. I was apprehensive of the questionable standard since it's a budget airline which gives the bare minimum, but get you from A to B. I took the plunge and tried to return to Hong Kong from Bali with it. It was operated by Thai Air Asia. I booked fly+bag+eat combo, sat on front row seat. Check in at Bali airport was friendly and efficient. I am happy to report that the experience had been very positive. Crew were courteous and smiling. Ordered meals were promptly delivered, and it actually tasted ok. I like the fact that Air Asia makes no qualm about bringing outside food and drink on board for own consumption. Seat was bound in leather, well padded and comfortable for the 4 hour journey. There was a lay over of 2 hours in Bangkok old airport Don Muang, it was welcoming as one could stretch the legs and do some shopping, or eat a good meal before the 2nd leg. The same good standard of service continued for the next flight back home. I was able to check my bags through from bali to Hong Kong. Transit process was very simple and direction crystal clear. Upon arrival, my bags were one of the first to come out. The fly bag eat combo actually do include priority luggage, a really nice touch. I also noticed that the 2 flights left and arrived on time. Based on the good experience, I will not hesitate to fly with them again in future.",0
Recently flew to Wellington from Auckland. The first thing I noticed was the metal bar sticking into my back from inside the seat. This made the flight a bit unpleasant during takeoff turbulence and landing. Cabin crew were very good. They let us view the flight deck after we had stopped at the gate. I'll give jetstar that their prices a very low compared to their only competition Air NZ. Would recommend jetstar for domestic flights but maybe not for International (on A320). If you like a nice seat that you can sit back and relax in then Jetstar might not be for you.,0
"Melbourne to Perth. Terrible customer service from the point of booking, on board to the point of returning. Absolute scammers. Cant ever talk to someone who understands clear english or what I'm trying to communicate. Very unhelpful staff over the phone. Treat you terrible. No sense of customer service.",1
JQ188 7 May 2013 14.55 Seat 1F Christchurch to Gold Coast. Good flight on time good service and nice cabin crew. It's only a 3 hour so a cup of tea and a book or magazine is all that's needed.,0
The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,1
Travel MEL-BKK on Jetstar business class approx every year.  I don't think of it as business class but more as premium economy and for the price I think we get a good deal.  It shouldn't really be called business class as it in no way compares to business class. Good food and drinks and very good customer service.  We wouldn't use the service annually if we were not happy but business class is only used for longer haul flights when we travel with other airlines.,0
"BNE-PPP on the 21st of June. Due to an early check-in, I was treated to an upfront seat (2C) instead of the original 9D I was given. Ground staff in Brisbane were wonderful, and the all-male crew onboard this mid-afternoon flight to Proserpine were terrific! It certainly got my Whitsunday holiday off to a terrific start! Overall, a wonderful flight at a good price! Ive noticed that on shorter hops, Jetstar is much better, but on longer flights (over 2 hours), its better to upgrade to an exit row seat, or fly another airline.",0
"Manila to Davao on Cebu Pacific. Both legs rescheduled three times, both flights left late allegedly due to congestion in Manila. Once in the air new clean aircraft and sufficient room for two hours on a low cost carrier. Much cheaper than the opposition. Most impressive was the speed of the baggage delivery in both Davao and Manila, up there with the best!",0
Flew from Singapore to Gold Coast in Scoot Biz. Had flown to Singapore from Brisbane in Premium Economy on Qantas so can make direct comparison. Scoot Biz (SB) was cheaper but seat size leg room meal service and entertainment options were worse if existent. The QF flight had tablet space for 2 drinks between seats SB had normal seat arm as in economy. Leg rest in SB seemed not worth it very little space due to pitch whilst I found meal indelible and nothing before landing or drink on takeoff. Also they made some announcement re streaming then didn't offer IPad. I was ready for sleep anyway. However the info on entertainment choice meant probably wouldn't watch it. In future I would go for Flystretch seats if I used them again after all they actually got to leave aircraft before Seat Biz. Warning in seat power is shared between 2 but use Singapore/UK plugs. Fellow travellers were also low cost travellers.,0
"ZIPAIR refuses to compensate me for damaged baggage. After landing in NRT, I found that everything in my baggage was wet and the outside of the suitcase was wetter than the inside, indicating that liquid had entered from the outside. I contacted Zipair via email to ask for compensation. However, ZIPAIR is not compensating me; they only provided a document for me to submit to insurance. I do not have insurance that covers damaged baggage.",1
"The AirAsia flight from Padang to Kuala Lumpur was delayed and arrived late. We had to wait an extra hour. The boarding was done quite quickly as the plane wasn't full. The flight encountered mild turbulence while on air but landing was harsh; we actually bumped into the tarmac. Other than that, everything went well.",0
My wife 3 children and I flew from Honolulu to Melbourne just under an 11 hour flight. No mention of needing to pre-book ipads. The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers? Apparently not.,1
Perth - Singapore Flt 4K132. Departure times changed by Jetstar multiple times due to 'bad weather'. From original 10.40pm to 11.40pm to following morning 08.00am to 2pm. When at Gate for the 2pm departure told flight cancelled due to crewing problems. Taken on coach from international terminal to domestic terminal to reclaim baggage. After 20-30 minutes waiting for baggage to arrive on carousel told to return for 2am flight or offered option to cancel. A terrible experience.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya via Singapore. This is the first time I fly Scoot. Somehow I do have a high expectation, since it is the low-cost subsidiary from Singapore Airlines. But my journey was quite dull. The interior of the aircraft is pretty much empty. The seat does not really recline or just broken. In comparison with other low-cost airlines, if the ticket price is way reasonable, I would not take Scoot again.",0
Flew SIN-SYD-SIN. Seats were really comfortable for a budget carrier. If you can book the economy plus (yellow seats). For a bit more you get a lot more leg space. The food and beverage bundle was worth the money. Food was nice and cabin crew was efficient. Hopefully they can size up their fleet so that there will not be any delays.,0
"12th Nov 2014. Flight: AK139 Hong Kong (1050 dep) to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2). This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced and I would pre-book meals with them in future. As for ""Inflight Entertainment"" that is non-existent as would be expected.",0
SIN-DPS / DPS-SIN Travelled with my parents last week and had booked wheelchair assistance both ways for our trip. At check in at Changi this was confirmed and my dad was well taken care of right up till he was seated. Cabin crew professional organised and polite. Seat comfort was ok legroom is tight but that was expected. Departure and arrival were both almost 40 mins late. Wheelchair was waiting after deplaning via stairs at Bali. (I did wonder how we would have managed getting my dad down had he not been able to use the stairs..) Fortunately he did and he was met by a friendly ground staff who took him all the way through. Bags were out quickly. Return from bali was equally efficiently handled. No problems with the wheel chair request and early boarding. All in all very impressed with Air Asia's professionalism and well run operation.,0
"I asked the ground crew during check in if I can fill in my water bottle, and they said that the cabin crew will help. Later when I asked the cabin crew for water, they said there is no free water.",1
Flew Cairns to the Gold Coast on 31st July on Jetstar. My seat was 1B and I had to agree to help in an emergency. We were delayed and a new aircraft was called into service causing a three hour delay. Overall a great flight.,0
"Flew Sydney to Yangon via Kuala Lumpur. OK, AirAsia is a budget airline, no trouble. Unless you have no money on you and no water, you are in trouble. Everything here has a price ticket, which was absolutely ridiculous on a 13 hour flight: since when do we have to pay for a human right (water). The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all. We were boarding the aircraft while the previous passangers hadn't even left the plane! Secondly, because of the lack of legspace, it will most likely be a very uncomfortable flight.",1
First time to a turbo prop its was a great experience. Short flight from Bacolod to Cebu then hop in and airbus A220 to General Santos in one day. Seating was OK for a short hop.,0
"Jakarta to Krabi via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia informed suspension of most of their flight operations on 26 March 2020 due to COVID19 situation. Since then I am trying to contact them via their AVA online chat but never can get through to an agent to actually file for refund as per their system. Also tried to call several ticket offices in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and never got through. The flight status is also unavailable even bookings are still confirmed. I do understand that the customer service is overwhelmed, but for such a company it should not be an issue to establish an efficient request process system. I really tried everything to contact them and I have to assume that this company is staling on requests in order to avoid the many refund requests. I am highly disappointed by what was once the best low-cost airline in Asia and will never consider them anymore in the future.",1
Jammu to Mumbai via Srinagar with IndiGo. It was a very pleasant flight and the cabin crew have a very welcoming nature. Cleanliness is well-maintained in all the aircrafts and the food tasted fantastic. The landing and takeoff are very smooth all the time. The restrooms do not smell like other airlines and the overall flight experience was amazing. I will definitely opt for it again.,0
"Pune to Lucknow via New Delhi. I have flown every low cost airline in India and I find Indigo the best. Their booking is hassle free through app on both ios and android. Web check-in is a breeze, getting any optional services is also good. The check-in is curteous and to the point. Mind you they dont allow even 1kg extra on planes without payment, plus they have also started to screen weight of cabin bag just before boarding the flight. Its a business model because they are a budget airline. The planes are clean with courteous crew. The leg space of economy seats is ample. I am a heavy built person and I have never faced space crunch in the seats. The in-flight food is okay, nothing to write about. I never had to wait for my baggage for more than 10 min. Overall the flight experience has always been good.",0
"Flight from Denpasar to Perth was delayed due to technical problems resulting in boarding about an hour late. The plane is pushed back for take off and then returns to stand with captain saying there are technical issues. We get off back into terminal and wait for +2 hours before reboarding plane. Whilst in terminal no offer of water or food - in fact passengers that bought water were told they were unable to take back with them onto aircraft. If you wanted water you had to buy. Eventually take off and get to Perth before landing and then waiting for further 30 minutes in aircraft with engines running as ""no ground crew to assist"" and lighting in plane left off so we disembark in the dark. Total of 11 hours for return trip to Perth and ruined what was a great first time trip to Bali. Have never used a budget airline before and will not be doing again. Indonesia AirAsia do not look after customers when there are problems.",1
"June 2015 I went on a small trip around Asia and I had 5 flights with AirAsia: HK-KL, KL-Jakarta, Jakarta-Singapore, Singapore-Bangkok, Bangkok-Xi'an. Beforehand, I read some reviews about AirAsia online and 99% of them were really bad. Everyone was complaining about delayed/changed flights and poor customer service. After all I read, I expected awful flights but in fact everything went smoothly. All flights were on time (except one - 2 hours delay) and customer service was good. And yes, you have to pay for drinks and food on board but come on, I got 5 flights around Asia for less than 200 altogether. I would fly with AirAsia again!",0
My flight was from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2015 at 11.55am. At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own.,1
"This route is already so uncomfortable for all involved! Especially heading from Townsville to Melbourne and the eta being 11.30pm! Honestly the worst crew tonight on my way back from Melbourne to Townsville. The worst I have ever seen. The customer service was so basic - a drink or snack, and admitting you would like something felt rushed, and that we were putting them out. No smiles or genuine care from any of the crew. And no tea or coffee as the heaters are broken. Trash got collected shortly after. Never saw them again. They all went down to the back of the plane until seat belt sign was turned on or we had to prepare to land. No walk throughs or a little chat here and there for a bit of customer engagement and moral. And they had time. The crew  avoided eye contact with passengers. I was really disappointed. And to add insult to injury we get off the flight in Townsville to walk single file, shuffling, tripping, and dragging luggage through a packed cattle crush of folks lined up facing us to get on the  plane back to Melbourne by 11.30pm! Its an experience like no other. Its just not even close to being good enough.",1
"Banjarmasin to Surabaya - this was an afternoon flight with Lion Air. The flight was delayed for approximately 40 minutes. The flight was smooth most of the time, except when climbing. The crew was attentive to needs of the passengers. Landing was a bit bumpy. It was raining in SUB when we landed.",0
"Adelaide to Melbourne. There were enough self check-in counters in Adelaide Airport, so I could checked in quickly. My Seat was 6A. The space of the seat was not enough, so I felt uncomfortable. The service of cabin crew was just at the standard level. As a low-cost airlines, there was no meal on this flight. But this flight was value for the price.",0
DPS-PER. A320. Booked hot seats row 14 exit row but would have preferred row 1 - not available. Also booked Red Carpet departure from Bali. I can't recommend this enough. A great treat to be personally escorted from check in security customs. Then lounge access. Although the shared lounge was very ordinary. No fault of AirAsia. When flight was called we were again escorted through departure gate into private mini-bus to the plane. The rest of the queuing passengers seemed aghast to our VIP treatment but well worth ever cent. In fact the cost is minimal. On board meals were OK but limited breakfast are ordered Hotcakes. Flight attendants smiling and answering bells quickly but difficult to understand announcements as others have mentioned. Plane about 50% full. Many seats at rear from row 15 with people stretching out across. No cockpit announcements at all and late arrival by 20 minutes into Perth. Priority luggage off easily.,0
I travelled on JQ524 Jetstar from Melbourne to Sydney on 19th August. I was given and exit row when I checked in on the automated machines. We were a little delayed into Sydney as they could only use one runway due to high winds. I always try and fly Jetstar.,0
As has been mentioned by others have flown Cebu Pacific for years. I have an account that pulls up 7 pages of flights that I've recently booked for family and friends and myself. But no more. Flights get changed too often and there is absolutely nil for error on the customer's part. This is part of the low cost ethos. I get it. However having not taken our flights last night owing to their computer not working we are out over 43000pesos. Forfeit is the term they throw around. When I booked all was fine when I flew each flight time was changed at least once. The last flight was 30 min. earlier which meant we missed our international flight. The girl at the counter tried to scurry but she knew it was for not. It is the customer's loss. As it stands they have flown a total of 10 empty seats that I have paid for. Some were my fault but some were due to scheduling conflict created by adjusting flight timetables. There is zero allowance for this. Low cost carriers yes! When they change a flight they still maintain forfeit forfeit forfeit.,1
Traveled from COK to KUL (LCCT) and back on AK 1203/1204. The in-flight services were truly good and the on time performance has to be highlighted.,0
"LGK-SIN. No frills as expected aircraft was clean service efficient flight delayed 30 minutes but made up some time in its turnaround at LGK. A320 seats were rather cramped with minimal legroom for an average sized ""westerner"". Some English cabin announcements were very difficult to understand.",0
"AirAsia from Singapore to Penang. Nothing to complain about - flight was on time, staff were friendly. As with all low-cost airlines, make sure you read the small print, check-in on line, pre-book and pay for your bags and you'll have a smooth cheap flight. I will be flying with them again.",0
HNL-MEL. Delayed 49 hours kept on runway for 3.5 hrs with air-conditioning on and off for up to 30min at a time little information from the cockpit. Eventually we were returned to the terminal to be told flight was cancelled spent next two nights awaiting more information given a disgraceful $250 Jetstar voucher as compensation - horrible experience.,1
"JQ 29 MEL-BKK Business Class. Boarding: There was a business class first call. However despite 2 doors economy marched through the business cabin. It is an economy airline. No great fuss and we were up and away. On the plane: After some tine refreshments were served and cleared. Up in the air: Orders taken for meals and immigration cards out and with no great rush a hot towel arrived. Cruising: Drink served and soon the meal which was pretty good appeared. Cheese and wafers and fruit and a glass of lovely Rutherglen muscadelle were great. Inflight service: Once ""service"" is over staff become very scarce and those who are about do not overtly seek eye contact. However a walk into the galley is greeted warmly and efficiently for any small request. Inflight crew: The captain and second were good on announcements and I look forward to having them up front again. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous but you felt that was the extent of the service offering. I was sitting next to an off duty staff member and was not greeted with a hello or any form of inquiry as to my flight for the duration of the flight. I suppose that is what separates the great airlines from the good airlines? If you love your product or just go to work is demonstrated by behaviours not platitudes of company jingles. Overall: Great plane and cabin and faultless service for most part. For the money Royal B and China E and Air Asia are strong competitors but there is a certain Aussy feel good on board especially with the majority Thai staff. In summary: Not a pretender a solid contender but could be be a class leader.",0
Well star class we all know - very average. But you get what you pay for. MEL-SIN. Flight delayed 1hr. The food they get in MEL is terrible compared what you get coming back from SIN. Service was ok. Seat are bad but hopefully when they get new aircraft's it will be lot better. The iPads they give you are boring. Overall it's a 7.5 hr flight - not that bad. We had another flight with Jetstar Asia to KL and they are just rude. I do that flight 6 times a year. But there cheap and they go to main airport not the Low cost one.,0
"Flew Palmerston North to Auckland. It comes down to this: You will get from A to B - but not necessarily when you expected. So if you can afford the time slippages - then $ for $ this is the cheapest solution. Don't fly Jetstar if you have to attend an event or connect with another flight. Is it just my imagination - or does the equation come down to the Jetstar Operations Management canvassing the details and going: - hmmm we don't have a full flight - so we won't spend the $ running the service yet. We'll employ Excuse Code No: 5 of about 10 - which in my case was ""your aircraft has been delayed in Auckland due to 'engineering requirements'"", thus we can merge the two half empty flights into one - and save on the running costs. Who knows - but it's mighty suspicious when you would expect the airport to be full of 2 sets of passengers waiting to travel - yet hello - it was still just one plane load 3 and a half hours later. So again - for the cheapest option from A to B and it doesn't matter if you get delayed - go for it. As for me, even though I could kind of afford to wait - it just wasn't really an enjoyable experience. Get your complimentary voucher when told there's a delay.",1
KUL-HKT-KUL. Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour due to late arrival of the plane as well as technical issues. Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that. We got excellent value for money because we booked these tickets about a year ahead at one of the sale promotions (Fare was US$ 45 return).,0
"Bandar seri Begawan to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. 7kg carry on limit makes no sense. With my camera and commuter stuff that's already nearly 7kg. It doesn't make sense that I can't take more. What's worse is that the company makes airport staff charge people fees to check in bag. I had a total of 14kg with two small bags. The staff made me check in my bag and charged me nearly 90USD ""for 0-15kg overweight"".  To top it all off, the staff lost my bags' special cover during transit and took no responsibility for it. They said ""that's not covered by us"" I will not fly AirAsia for these reasons.",1
"Air Asia what a joke. Their website doesn't work. Their check in machines at the airport don't work. There is no customer service. There are no offices. There are no phone numbers to call. You pay for a minimum of 20kg for luggage regardless of the actual weight (and the price goes up from there if you are the slightest overweight) You are jammed into seats like sardines. Worst flight I have ever taken. They say they will give you credit for your flights. Don't believe them. Your Air Asia account remains blank - no current bookings, no past bookings, no credit history, nothing in any of the folders. Make sure you have your own copy of all flight details cause you won't get them from their website or your Air Asia account. I booked online. When I received my ticket it had the wrong name, birth date and gender. What? I spent weeks hunting down a way to contact them to get it changed. Eventually I just abandoned the flight and booked on another one.",1
"I have flown with IndiGo on several occasions domestically and this was my first international flight with them. Seamless check in with very polite ground staff. Cabin crew were polite, pleasant and efficient. The aircraft was clean, even the lavatories were kept fairly clean. Choice of food onboard to be purchased was decent. DXB-BOM had a long check in queue but the process however was efficient. Onboard service and aircraft cleanliness was up to the mark. Seats are pretty comfortable, as they're slimmer hence providing a better amount of leg space. Departures/arrivals on time.",0
"Gold Coast to Sydney. A very disappointing experience. Expect condescending staff and opportunistic cash grabs wherever possible. In this case it was $130 to pay for 2 bags (1 per person) that were slightly overweight. They have the scales there ready to go Just before you board the plane and this is despite the check-in baggage allowance being 20kg and therefore no overall additional burden on the aircraft whatsoever. Add to this staff talking down to you like a child! Additionally, this was a return flight - the initial flight was with the parent carrier (Qantas) where a different weight limit applies, despite both flights appearing on the same ticket and under a Qantas letter head.",1
We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.,1
Mumbai to Udaipur. Excellent service and Air Hostess were polite and helpful. It was a really nice flight.Thanks to Pilot and the Crew members. We enjoyed our trip.,0
Chennai to Bangalore. The flight took off from Chennai on time with the captain warning us beforehand that there was very heavy weather over Bangalore that he would try to avoid. We eventually got to Bangalore airspace and ended up circling for 20 minutes or more until the captain announced that the thunderstorm had passed and we could land before our fuel situation worsened. Reasonably comfortable seat and friendly crew possibly the most efficient LCC in the Indian skies at the moment and wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.,0
"Dubai to Singapore via Chennai. New aircraft, very professional cabin crew. They assist me at the check in to put my luggage to Singapore via Chennai. Transit in Chennai was very smooth despite the procedures of Indian police - checking three times our passports but all went ok. On time flights. I will fly with them on this route if needed.",0
"Bacolod to Cebu. Check in staff was more on talking to each other despite of long line of passengers, you can see theres no sense of urgency or organization lots of check in staff but it seems theyre not interested in lessening the queue of passengers. Aircraft is clean, though its just a 25 mins flight, the flight attendants cared more on their own personal conversation than checking with passengers if they even wanted water!",1
"Sydney to Brisbane. They cancelled and rescheduled and cancelled again, repeatedly, in both directions of flight. I had originally booked 2 x 90 minute flights but Jetstar cancelled and delayed those two flights for over 3 days. I went between hotels and airports for 3 whole days! Finally I did get to my destination 36 hours late, but finally gave up on waiting for my return flight after another 26 hour wait, and asked for a refund and they agreed. I booked with another airline and left within hours. (Jetstar's reason had been weather, but all other airlines were still flying) When I left the airport, via a different carrier and applied for a refund online afterwards, Jetstar then refused to refund me for a flight they had already verbally told be was refundable, and which they had cancelled! Avoid Jetstar if you want any security or are hoping to get either a flight or your money back. Jetstar provides neither flights nor refunds.",1
"Melbourne to Cairns . Wouldn't give me a plastic bag for my 3 year old's 3kg travel pram so I could cover the ""troublesome wheels"". I asked at the gate and in the plane for help. Ticket collector said ""It's either you take the flight or the pram."" Now I'm carrying my girl in Japa. Meanwhile, the couple in front of us got on with five bags. Flight 944 Melbourne to Cairns 29th March. $350 pram thrown in the trash somewhere by the lovely Jetstar staff. And this was hours after they cancelled our 8.30am flight, forcing us to catch the 6am and wake up at 3.45am.",1
"I flew 3 routes with Cebu Pacific Hanoi to Manila and Manila to Caticlan v.v. The hard product is fairly standard for an Asian low cost airline. A well kept A321/320 with a tight seat pitch and no recline and a decent crew. What makes it quite an adventure is their passengers. Any flight I took with this airline started and ended in a chaos. People dragging way too much luggage into the cabin, people seemingly clueless where their seat is while blocking the aisle and frustrating the boarding process. The crew is helpless, but tries to keep cool. While preparing the cabin for departure several people start using the toilets meaning that during taxiing people are in the aisles. The flights are uneventful, although the last landing at MNL was quite rough. All in all not bad for the price paid, but an experience. When Cebu Pacific would pay more attention to their own cabin luggage criteria it would be much smoother. Butit is at least not as bad as described in some of the previous reviews",0
HON-MEL. Was satisfied with Jetstar no they are not Qantas but the 11 hour flight went fast. We were under a Qantas codeshare so we were supplied with food and drink. After take off we got a warm breakfast and then sometime later in the flight we got a hot lunch as well both meals were fine. I pre ordered a digi player for my friend and I to share and they ended up giving us one each and also the amenities pack. I would fly Jetstar again as you just cant beat there prices.,0
"Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. I have to commend A*****n for being so helpful towards me for this flight. Service from the AirAsia crew have generally been mediocre in the past but A*****n showed me a different side of the airline  compassion and attentiveness. She assisted me when there was an issue with my boarding pass, going till the extent of walking me to the right person in charge to get things sorted. Thanks A*****n , for changing my perception about AirAsia in general. I hope more of their staff can be as helpful as you.",0
"My 10-year old daughter had come down with traveller's diarrhea when we were about to take a flight with Indigo Airlines from Ahmedabad to Mumbai. By the time we were checking in it had become apparent that she was in no condition to fly. Fortunately to us, an employee of Indigo Airlines saw that my daughter was suffering. He invited us to an empty office where a short time later we were met by a doctor who examined my daughter and gave us medication and electrolytes. As a result my daughter's condition improved and we were able to take the flight after all. The help that we received was initiated by the attentive and very friendly Indigo Airlines staff. It was quick and un-bureaucratic with attention to detail (the staff organized a wheelchair and gave my daughter and us expedited access to the plain). We are very thankful for the assistance we received.",0
"Cebu to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. We paid an excessive price for 2 checked baggage because we could not do it online. On arrival we found our bag in a sorry state, I no longer had my cover, missing items, open bags. We are given a web page where to make a claim and as luck would not work. Company to avoid. If you do not want to pay more for your luggage than your ticket. FR: Nous avons pay un prix excessif pour 2bagages en soute car nous n'avons pas pu le faire en ligne. A l'arrive on a retrouv nos sac dans un piteux tat, je n'avais plus ma housse, objets manquants,sacs ouverts. On nous donne alors une page internet o faire une rclamation et comme par hasard cela ne marche pas. Compagnie  viter. Si vois ne voulez pas payer plus cher les bagages que votre billet d'avion",1
"Gold Coast Airport to Singapore. My friends had previously travelled on this flight and recommended I purchase the extra ""Yellow"" Stretch seats from Rows 21-25. Definitely do this! It cost me $66 extra but was it worth it! I'm close to 6 foot tall so the extra legroom was worth it alone. Food wise I played it safe and ordered the Ham/Cheese croissant and that was fine. I agree that a can of coke and small pringles is not the best ""health"" option but I bought my own food on board and there was no problem with that. Take an empty water bottle to refill. Don't try and take the bottled water through Gold Coast Customs - no go so you'll have to stand there and scull it! Scoot staff were fine and efficient. I can relate to the call button being ""dinged"" continuously due to the major design flaw of where the button is located on the armrest. All up I paid $745 back in January for this airfare and I am happy to do it again - but only in the yellow seats! The layout is 3-4-3 in economy and there were so mighty ""squashed"" people in those seats so invest the extra $70 (and hope that no one has the middle seat!). I agree with other reviewers that this section (Rows 21-25) is child-free and feels like your own little section. Gold Coast Airport Customs/Immigration is certainly not set up to cope with 3-4 International flights arriving at the same time definitely a poor ""first impression"".",0
"Cancelled my flight from Sydney to Gold Coast. Moved my flight to afternoon the next day and refused to time so I can change hotel bookings and ruined whole trip. Made me lose money and I lost and wasted multiple bookings in Gold Coast for different trains, entertainment, and my next flight.",1
KL to Chiang Mai and back. The trip was reasonably good the seats were comfortable for the short flight the meals where also quite good I had a nasi lemak and then spaghetti for the return flight. Overall it was good value for money and I would definitely recommend it.,0
"Airline staff at Ahmedabad were unprofessional and non-committal. Flight to Bangalore from Ahmedabad scheduled at 5 pm was delayed more than 3 hours and the behaviour of ground staff was irresponsible. As the expected time neared and no trace of the aircraft was seen the answer I got from ground staff was ""we don't know"". Arrival at Bangalore airport was chaotic. It took ground staff more than 40 minutes to put the baggage on the carrousel. Passengers arriving on other airlines were exiting the terminal before our baggage was even on the carrousel. Indigo was my preferred airline until my previous trip - a very steep deterioration in quality.",1
You do get what you pay for but in saying that the plane was spotless staff were nice easy trip and on time. Only downside was one of our direct flights was rescheduled so we had to stop over in Melbourne. Yes annoying but these things happen. Would I fly with them again. Yes definitely but only for a cheap fair. Wouldn't pay full price as the extras add up as I am a diver and have heavy luggage so wouldn't be worth it.,0
"Sydney to Phuket. Check in (after my flight with domestic Jetstar Melb to Syd) was fine and surprisingly quick. The flight also left and arrived on time and I enjoyed the 787 aircraft. The staff were very helpful and polite as well , The international food that can be purchased has deteriorated on Jetstar. The food (2 minute noodles and a very average chicken parmigiana) was nothing to get excited about even for economy food. Air Asia was much better. IFE entertainment was very limited as well. There was a very restricted choice of movies and music. I wasn't even able to access the music . When I mentioned this to one of the staff he said he'd check. I heard nothing more. I was also annoyed that Jetstar constantly changed the flight schedules. Not easy when one has limited time . I was lucky my boss was reasonable and allowed me to change my vacation times. But again I did appreciate the staff, the 787, easy check in and punctuality.",0
Delhi to Goa. Fantastic experience. We were given free upgrade to exit row seats with lots of legroom. Thank you to Priya who did a great job with excellent service. This was our 3rd time with Indigo and its been a great experience each time.,0
"Absolutely terrible airline. Almost non functional website, rude staff, flight time was changed 20 minutes before supposed start. Avoid at any cost, just fly with Philippine Airlines.",1
Bangkok to Manila. This is the worst airline I've ever dealt with. To cancel or change a flight be prepared to recieve a refund of not even a tenth of the original flight and to be charged ridiculous amounts for add ons. The in air food also consists of nothing but unhealthy foods. There's zero confidence or protection with the airline of something happens and things need to change. Keep this in mind when booking.,1
I asked the counter staff to assign windows seat for both flights. I confirmed twice with her and she certainly confirmed window seat. Both seats were not windows seats. This company told me a lie and not be able to reliable.,1
"Bangkok to Medan. Significant delay and no real apology. Flew QZ155. It only started to board at the time it should have been leaving, with no obvious reason (eg the incoming aircraft had been on time). Then crew running around and finding a passenger was missing. But then it took a further 30 minutes to find and offload the luggage from that passenger. So finally a delay of almost an hour. Not really acceptable on a 2-hour flight.",0
Flew Sydney to Singapore ScootBiz. Seats hard no recline and 100mls of tepid water free! Save your money! Food was disgraceful had to purchase everything and took 50mins to claim our luggage from the carrousel. Jetstar is first class compared to Scoot so stick to Aussie budget airlines.,1
"Napier to New Plymouth via Auckland. 2 days in a row my flights were delayed, 1st day for weather which is not their fault (understandable) 2nd day their landing gear jams on arrival at destination so 360 back around to Auckland for another day of delay. I buy a Air Nz flight and straight away get home. On applying for a refund they proved to have a incredibly bad call centre with terrible service and no urgency. Mistake after mistake they have made and now I currently have $14 of my $160 refunded into my account 14 days down the track? 3hrs of phone calls so far. Honestly not wasting my time with this company ever again.",1
BOM-LKO. Flew on Indigo thrice and all 3 flights were delayed. Paid extra to book seat of choice and meal. Check-in staff extremely rude and unfriendly. Cabin was not as clean as they rave about. Inflight cabin service without a smile. Only cold meals served. They also charge for wheelchairs with fares comparable to full service carriers. Not my choice and not recommended. Very pricey for a 'low cost airline'.,1
"Be careful on the Air Asia site as you think you are booking through Air Asia and then suddenly you are booking the flights you selected through kiwi.com - but it still looks like Air Asia! My flights were rescheduled to the next day but I was not notified. I turned up at the airport to find out my flight wouldnt be until the next day. Air Asia blamed kiwi.com and kiwi.com blamed Air Asia. I was not offered any compensation for the lost accommodation fees or expensive Uber to the airport, nothing. Neither Air Asia or kiwi.com would accept any responsibility. I hate to think what wouldve happened if I had a connecting flight. Do not book through Air Asia or kiwi.com, its not worth the trouble.",1
"Melbourne Avalon to Sydney with Jetstar was the worst experience ever. Found staff unfriendly at Avalon airport. Mindest of revenue generation. Even though I had paid for extra luggage and not used the total allocated allowance, they wouldn't let me take my handbag on board as it was slightly over. I did express for safety I would put the laptop under the seat not in the hat rack above, but this was not allowed. Even on a flight that wasn't full.",1
"Jetstar canceled my flight from Melbourne to Newcastle Sun 19/04 because ""Melbourne Airport required maintenance on the plane"". Jetstar could not get us on a flight today but they say tomorrow Monday. I'm waiting and hoping for no more nasty surprises.",1
Had the worst travelling experience travelling to and from Sydney to Phuket via KL. Hated every minute of it. Appalling service from the minute of check in both ends. Do not waste your time nor paper checking in beforehand. Do not buy food on board (maybe chips would be ok). Will never recommend nor use again.,1
"Aggressive strategies at gate I booked through Qantas so had a baggage allowance. I couldnt check in online (for ? No idea why). I tried checking in but the kiosk said seating issue. So I asked for help. A Jetstar person checked me in and asked if I was carry on. And I said I probably need to check (bc I guessed my bag weighed more than 7kg). The lady says it will be ok. Given Jetstar has misplaced my bags previously I thought this is better and maybe the plane wasnt full. No plans was very full and aggressively Charging extra to board (no option to check in so clearly no car re safety of overloaded plane). When I tried to explain Id wanted to check but counter staff had said it was ok I was rudely told this was my problem to have asked for my bag to be weighed. It was was so aggressive and clearly not for safety (flight boarding late, they would not have offloaded cargo) I do my best to never fly Jetstar. I will pay quadruple to avoid them.",1
"Hong Kong to Melbourne via Singapore. Extremely unreliable. I could've not have in-flight entertainment, or meals. I would not have care as much about the delay, but my god are they disorganised! Flight was delayed by 21 hours. Scheduled for 3:50pm, then rescheduled for 5:45pm, then again for 6:20pm. Checkout from the hotel was changed from 2:00pm (which would have worked out great) to 12:00pm. Now I'm stuck in the airport for 6 hours, with zero assurance the flight will be scheduled for the time specified. Pay the extra couple of hundred for a better airline, or if you have no other choice, don't bother, extend your stay a couple more nights and book with another airline, otherwise they're likely to extend it for you, in your stop-over, indefinitely.",1
"Flew Manila to Cebu with Cebu Pacific. One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. 5 hrs delay on departure, automatic rebooking on a flight later without information. Unable to provide full refund (only voucher) even under these circumstances. Staff lying at the ticket office.",1
Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was delayed one hour due to late arrival of aircraft. A little rough in parts due to the weather. Cabin staff were humorous and that made a big difference.,0
I travelled from Singapore to Berlin on Scoot. It was a long haul flight and was able to get some sleep. Arrived in TXL and was bused to the annex of airport.,0
"Flew Scoot from Male, Maldives to Singapore. Check in was a breeze. No line since we were so early. Friendly agents and quick passage through security and immigration. Walked on tarmac to gate so got to take a few pictures of the aircraft as well as others lined up next to our plane. Flight attendants all kind, smiling, polished and impeccable. Very consistent cabin announcements and service. All coach configuration with black leather seats. Everything is buy on board, including water. The food that was preordered smelled fantastic when served! Made me wish I ordered something. Cabin crew all friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend as the fare for an international 4.5 hr round trip flight was only about $300.",0
Horrible airline. Do not fly Jetstar. Totally unreliable. You have a 50-50 chance of your flight being cancelled then offered a 7 hour replacement flight for your 2.5 hour one in some ridiculous time slot. Happens all the time.,1
"Although having checked in online, for the baggage drop off you are being referred to kiosk / machine to print your own luggage tag, however most of these kiosks are out of order or suddenly run into an error while processing your request. After addressing this to the staff, you're just referred back to the kiosk and after insisting it won't work, finally being referred to a counter to drop off your luggage. At waiting your turn at the counter, the completely uninterested ground staff member simple wanted to refer me back to the kiosk again even after i've stated it didn't work. When i insisted she mentioned her counter was for checking inn cabin crew only, it was clearly she was lying as other passengers were checked by her before. In the end i got another staff member involved who told the lady behind the counter to actually assist me, after which my bag was checked in smoothly within 3 minutes. in the meantime many agitated passengers encountered the same frustrating experience! I truly don't understand why an airline would tolerate such rude and indifferent behavior. I've filled a complaint with AirAsia about this, but i only received an automated answer and the day after an email saying my case was closed (with no information given or anything). Flying with AirAsia? Never again for me.",1
"Singapore to Hong Kong. I bought business in May 2016 but Scoot cancel the route and change Tiger to operate and downgrade me to economy. All the business luggage and meal disappeared, just refund a little. I complaint to ask for better seat arrangement and free luggage to compensation. They change my request to 1st row seat & 30kg luggage but charge me.  I complained times to cancel the request, I said if I need to pay, I won't take it, ask them to revise me back for normal seat. However, their CS didn't amend, even on my travel day morning, I ask and ask in channel but no one revise for me. At counter, I refuse the first row, they assigned another row for me. Therefore, I ask for refund after my trip. However, I trace and ask, ask and trace million times, they didn't refund. Even until now, they still no refund.",1
DEL-CCU-DEL. Full flight outbound but seated in front row which was good. No queues at checkin nice crew cheerful and professional. Flight left on time and landed early - baggage was off within a few minutes wait. Coming back slightly less good check in experience - at airport several hours early after arriving in international - wouldn't let us check in until 2 hours before departure. When asked for front row seats were told we'd have to pay - got it free on outbound guess I was lucky! Flight crew again cheerful and attentive. Flight was early again bags took about 20 mins but that's par for the course in Delhi. Inflight food not paid and ok value for money.,0
Flew JQ29 to Bangkok in May from Melbourne. Flight left on time staff were polite and cheerful. Cabin crew were entertaining and prompt. Can't fault the service at all. Smooth flight arrived Bangkok on time. Good trip. Return trip was equally good.,0
Horrible customer service! I am in Canada and booked a ticket from Sydney to Melbourne tonight. I thought I selected a 12.20 pm departure but ticket showed 7.00 am so I immediately called long distance to Australia to correct. Agent was helpful and spoke to manager 4 times on my behalf but manager refused to budge at all. They wanted a change fee of $200 or they could not change! How ridiculous as I literally just made the booking and was clearly an error and not due to my changing any plans. I am very disappointed as Canadian airline would have dealt with differently - in fact within 24 hrs there would be a full refund or change. I will never use Jetstar again.,1
Our flight on November 2 from Lombok to Denpasar became memorable only because of the inflight service. A talented steward serenaded the passengers with a most lovely original song that soothed and enhanced the flight. A most unique personal touch we've never experienced in all our years of international travel.,0
Flight from Narita to Cairns was delayed due to mechanical problems - fair enough. Then we could not take off due to Narita being closed after 11pm - again fair enough. Captain very apologetic. That was nice. All passengers had to disembark retrace their steps through immigration and pick up their luggage - again fair enough I suppose. But then the whole planeload of passengers was left milling around trying to find out what was going to happen from a couple of harassed young Japanese Jetstar employees with limited English who were doing their level best in the face of increasingly bewildered and irritated passengers. After an hour or so news filtered through that there would be another flight late the following day. Eventually someone must have found the key to the room where the public address microphone is but no accommodation arranged or suggested and a couple of hundred people with all their bags simply left to their own devices in a deserted terminal in the middle of the night. Delays happen of course they do but you need a contingency plan for occasions such as these - and invest in a bullhorn for heavens sake so that you can keep people informed. When we eventually did get off the ground the service was fine and the food good.,1
"Flew various domestic flights with IndiGo through last year. All flights on time, never more than a ten minute delay, and they have a fairly comprehensive network.  Food was poor, choices often not available. Prices are no longer cheap. Staff is competent but not that courteous. They use bus boarding even at terminals where airbridges are empty which is irritating.",0
"Yesterday I flew from Thailand to Malaysia. Air Asia charges extra for every possible option. I booked a ""hot seat"" which should have priority boarding. No priority was ever offered and I was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. I also pre-booked food. I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing. The floor of the plane had bits of trash all about. The worst flight I have ever been on.",1
Hyderabad to Chennai. I had the worst experience flying with IndiGo airlines. The flight was delayed by 2 hours and adding to that handling of baggage was horrible. Baggage of 6 flights was released on a single belt at the same time. It took almost 1 hour to find the baggage and to find the baggage I had to make my way through 1000s of passengers waiting for their baggage. When contacted customer service they didn't have the contact info of IndiGo go personal in the airport.,1
24 December 2014. Melbourne to Bali. A satisfactory flight. Very friendly helpful staff. The new 787 was very comfortable. I prepaid the IFE and food. The IFE was very limited. They should extend the range of movies and music. The food was quite good but also quite limited for a 6 hour flight. The main meal could have been more substantial and some sort of late evening snack should have been included.,0
"I have booked them for Trip to Taiwan and unfortunately impacted by Covid-19. So i requested for a refund. In the beginning, it is voluntary, and then it is a credit account request and finally, it is refund back to original payment. So I have chosen credit account while the refund back to original payment is not available at this time. Soon when refund back to original becomes available, i raised refund case again. Then i have contacted them many times to advised them i only need the last case progress, and they said: ""don't worry, we will process the latest case under your account."" Then they choose to refund back to the account, not original payment method, and now refused to refund back to the original payment method.",1
I have taken 2 trips to Phuket in the last 6 months flying AirAsia from the Gold Coast I found them to be an excellent airline they always left on time and arrived on or before the advertised arrival time the cabin crew are great and the food was not bad either the in flight entertainment was ok. They had the shortest travel times from all the airlines that fly to Phuket and the best prices.,0
I was supposed to fly from Delhi to Mumbai this morning (10.25am) on Indigo but Delhi airport was heavily fogged out and the runway operations had been shut for a few hours. I was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal. Upon arrival I was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and Indigo were unsure when departures would take place. They immediately asked me if I would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening I declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties. The whole affair was so well handled I was most impressed by Indigo's ground staff. This is one rare gem in the Indian aviation scene.,0
"Puerto Princesa to Manila. Always delayed! Choose another airline instead (i.e., Philippine Airlines). Very unorganized and does not update the passengers whats happening. Never again will we fly with this airline.",1
Flew from Goa - Delhi on 11 Aug 2014 Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant. The only negative point would be air hostesses being less interactive and involved.,0
"Denpasar to Semarang. Probably one of the worst airline in the World. Delay has become a bad habit and they keep announcing delays without ever giving you the right information. Instead of being able to go to a restaurant, they make you wait announcing that you will fly in the next 20 minutes. 2 hours later you are still waiting. You are left with no food or drink that they should legally provide. Add prohibitive luggage fee (Im not talking about excess) and you could fly a decent airline for the same price. Avoid at all cost.",1
"I took the flight AK 138 from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong in 0715 in the early morning. The ground service was okay. It delayed 14 minutes before takeoff. Breakfast is served once the aircraft is stable. The cabin crew was kind and gentle. Nearly everything is extremely spicy so I went with the chicken rice and the wonton noodles. The food was tasty. The seats are comfortable enough. The ride was smooth with little turbulence, but the landing was a bit harsh.",0
"8 hour flight, definitely not cheap and they don't even provide water or snacks! Incredible! Seating is not reclining, very uncomfortable! It was freezing, I asked for a blanket and the hostess said I had to pay for that but they were out of stock! Really? It's already ridiculous that I should have paid for a blanket, but even more so that there weren't enough blankets for everyone! Also, no wifi and no screens (not even a big one, we didn't have any info about the flight, like position, ETA) Worst flight of my life, never again with Cebu!",1
"Jetstar were terrible from start to finish flying from Manila to Singapore. Having booked my ticket online and pre-paid for hold luggage and a meal on board I was told at check-in that I hadn't paid for baggage. The check in attendant was adamant that I hadn't paid but after a phone call to their service centre it was confirmed that I had paid for baggage and food. Problem solved - or maybe not. Once we had taken off, the pre-paid meals started arriving, having been through this process a number of times with other airlines I had my boarding card out ready to be checked. 30 minutes later my meal hadn't arrived so I spoke to one of the flight attendants who were again adamant that I had not paid for a meal (even though check in had confirmed this!). I even showed my booking confirmation to which I was still denied a meal as it wasn't on their sheet. I was point blank refused a meal. Fairly cheesed off I wrote in to the customer service department to complain. The service didn't get any better, in fact I would say it got worse. Having explained the situation I was offered a AUS$25 voucher to be used on jetstar.com.",1
Flight was rescheduled. Then on the changed connect flight there was a delay in departure from 16:55 to 17:35. Delay was not acknowledged or intimated or informed to us of the specific delay. Uncalled for rescheduling and delay of flights.,0
I flew on a return trip SIN-HKG on a Boeing 787 economy class. The worst part about Scoot is booking on its website. It automatically selects add-ons so you need to stay vigilant when booking your flight. The flights both were ordinary and the 787 cabin was comfortable. I flew on a flash sale fare without any add-ons or checked luggage making my flights worth the money. Passengers with checked luggage and those who need to reserve seats for family members may find better fares on other airlines.,0
"This is the first time I flew with Jetstar and I will never dare to try it again, even if I have to pay double. I knew this was a budget airline, so I never had any high expectations on it. However, Jetstar is literally the worst budget airline. They have you retrieve your baggage between connection flights and have a super expensive fee for checked baggage! We had a domestic flight from Sapporo to Tokyo and followed by an international flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong with Jetstar. The staff at Sapporo check in counter did not speak a word of English, so when she struggled to tell us that we had to get our luggage and re-check in through their international flight counter in Tokyo, we thought we heard her wrong. Also, they charged us 10,000 yen for 2 luggage bags and measured the dimension of the only carry-on we had.  The domestic flight was late by 30 minutes. Our layover time in Tokyo was supposed to be 1hr 50min. So by the time we got to Tokyo and got our bags, it was already less than an hour before the flight takeoff to Hong Kong. We had to run all the way to their counter and check in our bags again and ran to the gate, just to later on find out the flight to Hong Kong was also delayed. The boarding is always a disaster for them. They have all the passengers lineup for boarding at once and could take almost an hour to finish boarding, no wonder their flight is always late. Staffs were unresponsive and rude.  Due to their delayed flights, we could not have a chance to eat before we got on board, so we wanted to order food off the menu. I tried to call the attendants 3 times that we wanted to order, they kept telling me to wait. My husband said they may only take order with their food trolley which they moved from front to the end cabin. OK! That doesnt make any sense but alright I will follow their rules and wait, unfortunately we sat at the end of the cabin. So we waited for another hour and the food trolley finally passed by and passed right through us, without stopping and back behind the curtain!! I was like, didnt I tell them again and again I wanted to order? How could they just ignore us like that? We called one of the attendants back and she goes, I am sorry, all our food is sold out. Could anyone tell me what did I miss there? If you want cheap flight, I can tell you this airline isnt exactly cheap with their high checked baggage cost and extra carry-on cost. The inexperienced and helpless staffs could also cost your vacation mood. I often travel to Japan and Japanese are always well-known of their efficiency and hospitality. I had never experienced anything like that with any Japanese company before, it was a very unfortunate experience.",1
"Cairns to Perth via Darwin. As a budget subsidiary of Qantas. I was expecting Jetstar to be half decent. Next time Id rather just pay the extra $100 to go on a Virgin plane and get everything included. With Jetstar, you have to pay for checked baggage and for seat selection and meals which adds to the cost and it somehow ends up being more expensive than Virgin or Qantas. The flight I was on JQ 920, was scheduled to leave Cairns at 0850 and arrive in Darwin at 1125. A Jetstar employee notified customers that the flight was delayed by half an hour. 20 minutes later, the same message was repeated meaning the flight had been delayed by an hour. Then I got a notification on my phone saying that the flight wasnt going to leave until 1650!! This was bad news for me as I had a connecting flight out of Darwin. I then spoke to both Jetstar and Qantas customer services and they couldnt put me onto another flight combination (even though there were at least 20 seats on two Qantas planes back home, I googled it). The customer service, in my opinion handled it very poorly and only offered me accommodation in Darwin. I needed to get home urgently for an appointment the next day but they couldnt care less, no sympathy shown at all. I am very disappointed with Jetstar and Qantas and for that matter I will no longer fly with them (this is the fourth time in a row where I have been delayed on a Qantas or Jetstar flight in a year). Never fly with these people on domestic services.",1
After paying 1400 AUD to fly from Sydney to Bali I expected a decent service. I asked for a blanket and they wanted to charge me 10 AUD. Had to pay 10+ AUD to watch any single movie and of course no water or food for a 7 hour flight. On top of that the flight got delayed and the seat space was pretty narrow. It is one of those companies that offers less for more. They want to take out from you as much money as possible.,1
"On Line Check-In run well. No need to go to check-in desk in the airport. The plane was clean. Flight was on time (departure & arrival). Seat was a regular pitch for low cost carrier. The cabin crew was friendly. They spoke well and clear when doing the public addresses. There was no in-flight meals, normal for low cost airlines. However, they sold meals through pre-ordered or in-flight order. We landed in T2 in Soekarno Hatta airport and transfered to T1 using bus.",0
"Jakarta to Manila. I have booked Cebu Pacific for the first time not knowing that eventually I have to book 2 separate booking for my flight without paying a luggage with Cebu Pacific. I was trying to pay the baggage online unfortunately the situation made me not to do it as I need to speak to Customer Representative in person to express that I prefer to pay 1 payment since it is the same airline and there is no sense to pay 2 times  for the same day flight. At the end the representative who checked me in at first country, could not help with the reason that it is different booking, and very likely He did not put any effort to speak with his superior. Very much disappointed booking with this airlines. Seems the customer satisfaction is number 10 (if it can be the last).",1
"Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Apart from the not so nice service from the ground service, the flight was generally great. The cabin crew was generally cheerful and friendly but could be better.",0
Singapore to Densepar via Jakarta. Do not use this airline if you are a traveller and travelling to Bali from any destination. The airport staff made my partner and I book an outbound flight from Bali or would refuse us entry onto the plane. We told them that we were going to extend our visas by 30 days when we entered but they didn't listen or care. The check in was due to close and they sniggered at us across the room as we frantically tried to search for some cheap flights which we would never use. They cost us an extra 140 pounds. We have been trying to contact lion air customer care for days without a reply. Honestly the worst airline I have ever flown with. Avoid at all costs and pay the extra money for a better airline.,1
"Gold Coast to Sydney. Do not fly Jetstar. I travel for lite work, but have to carry a computer and in past my small briefcase has not been included in hand luggage weight. I was charged an extra 65 dollars in the queue for being 2kg over. No point in flying with them. Go with a better carrier and dont get ripped off.",1
Flights were cheap planes were clean staff helpful. Booked all flights online. There were never any problems with cancellations or baggage. This is definitely a no frills airline but still one of my favorite airlines world wide.,0
"Melbourne to Cairns. Went to gate 48, terminal 4 to board. Shocked to find people lining up as usual i.e. closely bunched up, despite being well into pandemic precautions with the entire country aware of appropriate social distancing. Speaking to the staff and asking them to remind people to appropriately distance they responded it is up to individuals and they wouldnt make any announcement. They were not only unreceptive to this idea they were actively annoyed that I would bring it up. Good luck Australia. With attitudes like this from Jetstar staff god help us all.",1
DPS-CGK. Departure hall at DPS was very chaotic due to the construction of the new airport. Lion Air ground staff very unorganized. Seats were narrow with literally no legroom whatsoever and I am only 5 ft 9. We did not have any other options on this route due to high season but I would have flown to SIN or other destination and then reach Jakarta instead. They have newer aircraft's in their fleet several Boeing 737-900ER so overall cabin was still very clean. That would be the only plus I can summarize from my experience.,1
"Denpasar to Singapore. Beautiful experience at this airport with staff. There were smiles and patient explanations given throughout. One of the ground staff at my flight had assisted in explaining why my odd shaped luggage was not suitable and needed to be checked in at the airline counter. Feeling skeptical at that point and ready to lose that piece (it's a kite, light and small but has poined ends and hence hand-carry abroad was not allowed), was pleasant to find luggage arriving in 1 piece. We did not purchase check in luggage space and hence was surprised by the additional service provided to check in our kite at no additional cost. A very big thank you to the ground staff who attended to us.",0
"The worst ground service ever. Paid for extra baggage of 20 kg apparently should be in 1 big luggage charged extra for having 2 small baggage, or package it as one, which is the same price (will pay again going back). She placed us in different seats as a family.",1
"Singapore to Phuket in 2018. I wanted to book a flight for my wife, my daughter (1 year old) and myself but was not able to book a seat for my daughter online. So I called Scoot, they told me to just book a ticket for my wife and me and add our daughter to our tickets, and after booking I would need to call Scoot again to request for a seat for our daughter. It turned out when I called to confirm the seat that I had to pay the adult seat rate to get a seat for my daughter after already paying for the infant fee of 75SGD! So eventually I paid almost the double fee for my daughter than I had to pay for our own tickets! It is a ridiculous policy of which I still can't believe that they even dare to request this! With most airlines you fly for free with an infant but when you want to have a seat you pay a normal rate but with Scoot you have to pay double the normal rate!",1
"One thing is clear. Indigo have 0 standards to fly International. They are not capable enough. My in laws were travelling from Ahmedabad to Abu Dhabi. 5 days before the flight the itinerary changed to Ahmedabad to Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. Even though they were senior citizens, we didn't have any choice but to accept the revised itinerary. They reached Ahmedabad airport. Checked in. Got the boarding pass and boom. 1 hour before the flight they confirmed they don't have a plane to transport them from Ahmedabad to Mumbai. With google algorithms I understood the Raipur Ahmedabad flight created delay for Ahmedabad Mumbai domestic. But they didn't have any other backup. This had happened several times with me & I have stopped booking Indigo for my international destinations. My father in law called up the customer care they said, ""Sir aaj flight cancelled he. Aap ghar jaiye."" (Sir today's flight has been cancelled. Please go home.) Ghar jaiye???? (I have a recording) Is this a Jantanagri express that got cancelled? He fought with the customer care guy & then they offered next day flight of Ahmedabad to Delhi to Dubai. I had to take a leave from office & travel to Dubai to pick them up. Also they didn't give any hotel or food till 11.59 pm. After 12.00 am they gave lounge access & some food. They were at airport since previous day 5 pm. Till 12.00 am nothing was given. They said your flight is scheduled next day at 4.00 am so we can't give food & lounge today. Seriously? I would recommend people around the world even if you are getting 99% off from Indigo don't travel unless time isn't money for you. Yes I do accept they are a little better in Domestic but International. A big no.",1
"Flew Scoot from Singapore to Melbourne. Purchased a more expensive ticket for their 'scoot in silence' seats which promises an adult-only zone which is silent so you can sleep. However my and my wife's seat was directly next to the toilet, and consequently the queue, the flush and the banging door. It was actually the noisiest flight I've ever had. I complained and was told there was nothing they could do. I've also added up the money I save by the cheaper ticket, and with all the other hidden charges it would have been cheaper to fly with a better airline. Yes, they are a budget airline, but there are some things which shouldn't cost money, such as good service. When our plane was boarding, the staff were just talking to each other and a huge amount of people were confused and not even sure what was happening. The food is also terrible - we paid for two teas (yes you have to pay even for tea), and they bought two foam cups and handed us two tea bags. We asked for milk, and got a strange look, and eventually someone came back with powdered milk sachets.",1
Took the inaugural flight from Chiang Mai to Singapore. To say it was just another flight would be an understatement. And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around. Having done PR for major events including such new services I was sorely disappointed. Frankly Thai Ai Asia's product is far below that of its big brother in Malaysia and it shows.,0
"When flying from anywhere else to Singapore, there is no online check-in or boarding pass. I flew into BKK on a separate itinerary and stayed at the (expensive) hotel inside of the airport security zone. Thanks to Scoot's lack of online check-in I had to spend hours going out through immigration and back through security so I could check-in at their only counter at 5am. Please be aware the you will not be able to stay in the secure area if you are using Scoot as a second leg of a separate itinerary on the way to Singapore. I will not be flying with Scoot again until they have a modern online check-in system, there is no excuse for this in 2017.",1
"Dubai to Trivandrum. We had a eventful day flying from Dubai to Trivandrum, first upon check in we were told that we lacked a return ticket out of the country so our visa would not be valid. The check in lady was very friendly and explained it very calmly. So my son and I went to book a flight out of the country, returned to the check in counter, where the lady saw us and waved us over and let us jump the que. We proceeded to security where the staff was friendly and gave clear directions to passengers who did not know the rules yet. After security however things got exciting again, while presenting our boarding pass I heard the staff talk to each other and we were told there was something in our bag that caught their attention. All was said in an extremely friendly manner while we racked our brains trying to imagine what was in the suitcase. I was allowed down to the tarmac where I opened the suitcase and it was examined, it turned out to be a door stop I brought? The staff were friendly during all of this and let us into the plane with a smile. The flight itself was very nice the seats were more comfortable and spacious then our previous flights with Pegasus. All in all the staff was extremely friendly and professional.",0
Flew from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and then KL to Melbourne. Check-in online simply didn't work for us using any type of computer. Was also unable to manage my booking as system never allowed us to log in. Check in at Bangkok airport horrendous. Had to argue with check in agent to change seats so both of us were seated together (something we attempted numerous times online). Book with realistic expectations as that's all you will receive. Make sure you're at the gate in plenty of time as the gate suddenly closes with no announcements.,0
"Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. As what I am expected from AirAsia low-cost airlines, decent service and flight are always present in the whole experience. The time of flight departure is quite accurate. One of the hassle is the flight is getting strict with their 7kg cabin baggage rule. The seat is quite comfy, in comparison with other low-cost airlines. The interior is more vibrant compare to the others. I experienced no turbulence, as what I remember during the flight. Overall, would love to fly with AirAsia again.",0
"Singapore to Darwin. 5 hours before departure I was informed by SMS that the departure will be postponed by 8 hours from 11:00 pm to 07:00 am. I was able to leave my luggage in the evening and the airline took care of a good 4 star hotel with transportation and dinner. The staff was friendly and helpful. The aircraft made an average, maintained impression. There was water and small bites during the flight.",0
KL to Kota Kinabalu. I was hoping for a more Malaysian style welcome however I was not even shown to my seats. The cabin crew were fixing their hair and make up and chatting. I was not offended but in my 18 years of flying I have never seen such sight.,1
"Chennai to Singapore with IndiGo. Very nice seat, staff are very kind and smile faces. Pilots done very good job during lightning and turbulence inflight. Flight timings very perfect. Crew are very aware when passengers not wear seat belt during take off and alight.",0
Posted fares are deceptive and your actual fare may double. We flew Clark to Singapore connecting to Jakarta. There is a fee to connect fuel surcharge security charge web admin fee luggage $50 aviation levy and seat selection fee for each leg. My original trip was 14000 peso but I ended up paying 30500. You can take PAL or Garuda for the same price. There needs to be transparency in pricing and their advertising is deceptive. Aircraft was half full but you are not allowed to move to a seat with more space. I had middle seal in the last row with passengers on both sides. In spite of empty seats forward I was not allowed to move. Hand carry baggage was on the floor blocking egress as the overheads were jammed full. I kept briefcase at my feet.,1
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Self check-in machines are not available across the airport, but it is only available in the Airasia check-in counter section, which requires a bit of walking. This same goes to the boarding gate which is quite far. I hope Airasia could get a better spot of it.",0
"Friendly service, attractive staff, comfortable flight with AirAsia from Manila to Puerto Princesa. Customer service on the phone was helpful, but rigid and inflexible. After having a flight cancelled 2 days beforehand, I was unable to reschedule a flight back from Puerto Princesa for an arrival time to meet my international flight in Manila. As a result, I had to cancel all of my 3 flights back to the US, rebook my flight to Manila at 200% the rate that I originally paid, and then rebook all of my US flights. It was extremely inconvenient and AirAsia provided no leniency. I am fortunate have the finances to cover the extra charges, but it was a terrible experience to go through while on my one vacation for the year. However, online customer service options are ineffective, putting the customer first is obviously not any kind of priority (budget airline) and ability to reason outside of a cut-and-dry system is impossible.",1
They rescheduled my flight 3 times without offering any accommodation and even apologizes. They did it at the very last moment when I already couldnt book another flight from normal company. I payed for direct 6 hours flight from Delhi to Istanbul. Finally they operated 9 hours with a stop in Doha when they even didnt let passengers to come out from the aircraft!!,1
MEL-SIN-MEL with Jestar along with some intra asia flights. On the outbound it was on a newer A330 which had the seat back AVOD. Had pre-booked meals and the I have to say it was the best inflight meal I have ever had (spicy Chicken with rice). The seat next to me was empty so comfort was quite good as I got to stretch out a bit. All intra Asia flights were pretty good but nothing more than what was expected i.e. got me to where I was going! Inbound flight did not have the seat back AVOD and have to say that I got a sore neck by the end of the flight as the Ipad has to sit on the tray table which is at an uncomfortable height. Flight attendants on all flights were nice and always willing to help. All in all I will be flying again with Jestar as they get me where I am going and at a good price.,0
Flew BNE to TSV. travelling with special needs passenger boarded first with 3 seats between 2 of us. check in staff were quite rude we had overweight baggage and I was fine with paying this without complaint. Check in lady wrote ticket and just pointed when I ask what the pointing meant was quite rude. The inflight staff were fantastic fun its just the people on the ground who give Jetstar a bad wrap. Flight left on time and arrived early.,0
"I wouldnt recommend this airline for a long trip to anyone!!! It was the worst long trip of my life. I had to take 2 flights with scoot, from Manila to Berlin with stop in Singapore. The first one (Manila to Singapore) was just a couple of hours so it was ok, although it arrived delayed, so I had to run to catch my connection. The second flight from Singapore to Berlin should last 13 hours. I thought this plane would be much bigger an comfortable than the one before, but it was exactly as bad. It could fit more passengers, but everything was exactly as narrow. I would get no pillow, no blanket, no screen with movies, no food, not even a glass of water! I never experienced something like this on an intercontinental flight, I thought it was not even allowed. You could of course buy something but totally overprice, like a small cola for 5 euros. Honestly, low cost has gone too far. The seats were as small as the ones of a 2 hours Ryanair flight, but for 13 hours. In addition, it was so unfortunate that I had to sit in the very last row, in which you couldnt put the chair back, not even just 1 cm. It was almost unbearable to be 13 hours sitting like this and with no refreshments. For a short 2-3 hours flight might be ok to use them, but if you can avoid this airline for longer flights, do it by all means!",1
We had to fly to Singapore from Auckland and we needed a direct flight. I am very pleased with the airline it was an agreeable surprise. I knew it is a budget Airline so I booked the bundles and was prepared for the worst but it turned out to be a pleasant experience and I must say that the personnel on the ground and in the air were most friendly and professional. Sure you don't get free alcohol drinks or free food but this is why they can offer cheap flights! You can always buy your own food and bring it onboard! All in all I can recommend this airline.,0
MNL-CEB / CEB-MNL - Flight was on time it was pleasant nothing really special but generally OK. However we experienced a bit of inconvenience as the line for the check in counter at the terminal 3 in Manila was strangely slow. It might be due to the passenger volume but they could have done better service.,0
"Kota Kinabalu to Singapore. I arrived at check in 3 hours before the flight and proceeded to check in. At check in my wife was questioned as she was traveling on a Russian passport and even though we live in Singapore and provided evidence the staff still had a long discussion in Malay about whether to check her in. Eventually they did and they gave us our boarding passes. I  asked if we were all sat together and the check in agent clearly said yes. It wasn't until we got to immigration and i was asked to show our boarding passes when i saw they had my 2 year old daughter sat in a different row to my wife and I. This was very frustrating as it also happened on my flight from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu where the  check in staff told me i had to pay them if we wanted to sit together. I challenged the way the seats were allocated in Singapore to be told that it wasnt anything to do with them it was a computer who allocated seats. Clearly the computer doesn't have a family or doesn't want to sit with its family if it ever travels. The staff were not helpful at all in Singapore, it was only when i got onto the plane and spoke to the cabin crew did we find staff who were helpful and then helped us sort out seats together. On the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore i had to speak to the gate agent who helped us find seats together. I dont understand why Air Asia cause families problems at check in when they can clearly accommodate seats together. Why add extra anxiety and why cause cabin crew or gate staff more problems because the check in staff cant be bothered to help customers? Low cost airlines splitting up families so they can earn extra revenue is being investigated in the UK and the US Senate has stopped airlines splitting families.",1
Sydney to Launceston. For an extra two kilos in handbag on a domestic flight they charge me $65. A courteous passenger offer to take the extra weigh. But the staff opposed firmly. They were very unhelpful very greedy.,1
"It was the our first time travelling on Scoot from Perth to Singapore and return. I had paid extra to select our seats. It was at the boarding gate just before I went to board that I noticed that our boarding tickets had a different seat number to that which I had selected on my original booking. At no time did anyone from Scoot inform me that my original seat selection had been changed. I have personal reasons for wanting to select the seats that I selected (close to the front of the plane, but given seats at the rear of the plane), so was happy to pay extra for this, otherwise I would have not bothered to select the seat option for the booking. Also the flight was delayed by 2 hours. Return fight no better. Boarded plane and was seated only to be told to get off due to plane mechanical issue and wait more than 3 hours for a replacement plane. We have flown with many other budget airlines and never had problems. Based on our experience I cannot recommend Scoot Airlines.",1
Singapore to Bangalore. Worst experience flying with Scoot. Was not allowed to put my cabin luggage in the compartment above the seats and the air hostess was rude. I had to fly with my legs folded throughout the journey. Never flying again with Scoot.,1
Denpasar to Lombok. 2.5 hours delay and counting on boarding. No response from the airline staff or gate staff about the expected boarding time. The pricing for the ticket is cheap. However it is known that the Lion Air always delays. Pick a different airline.,1
"My wife and I have traveled SE Asia extensively over the past 18 months with two return trips to Melbourne Australia for short stays. I find the app to be somewhat klunky but Im used to it by now. However, thats the only negative. We have found the food to be surprisingly nice considering its airline food. The staff are friendly and not once have we had issues with lost luggage. For a low budget airline were very satisfied.",0
Flying Lion Air (operated by Wings Abadi Air) from Kupang to Atambua on 16th June. It was nice journey onboard although it is a short flight. New ATR72-600 had quite nice legroom. Price was very affordable. Flight attendants have nice uniforms accompanied by wonderful smile. I will recommend and choose Wings Air in short flight again.,0
"MEL-BKK 30 May 2013 business class and was delighted with the change of service level since my past experience with the airline approximately one year ago. Check in was efficient with a dedicated business line. Use of the QF lounge was available as was use of the immigration express lane. Flight was 1 hour late departing as the aircraft required ""routine maintenance"" and both the cabin crew and captain apologised for the delay. In-flight service was good and included a complimentary drinks and meal service. Cabin crew were very efficient and attentive. Of the meal choice offered selected a form of lamb stew which might have been appropriate for a Melbourne winter but far too heavy as an appropriate meal. In-flight entertainment was through the use of an iPad. A330 aircraft was clean although the seat pitch could have been better. Overall good service and value for money.",0
"The check-in process at the airport was relatively efficient, with attentive staff members assisting passengers. The boarding process, though, felt a bit disorganized. It took longer than expected, and there was minimal communication from the gate agents regarding the delay. The cabin of the aircraft was clean and well-maintained, but it appeared a bit dated. The seats were comfortable enough for the duration of the flight, but legroom was limited. I found it difficult to stretch my legs. The cabin crew on my flight was polite and responsive to passenger requests. However, the service was modest at best. But, the food was good. In summary, AirAsia provides a modest service that gets the job done but doesn't go above and beyond. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option and don't mind sacrificing some frills, this airline could be a suitable choice.",0
"Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur. Original flight was cancelled & rescheduled to another timing which meant I reached my destination several hours later close to midnight.  On the plus side, flight left on time & landed early.",0
"Never again with AirAsia. I wish I could have given it 0 stars. This is coming from a loyal customer during pre-pandemic days. This airline unfortunately never recovered from the pandemic. Both sectors (inbound and outbound flights) were delayed by more than 1.5 hours. Finally landed in the domestic terminal and was ushered by a bus to go to international, before walking all the way to immigration, and then had to wait for luggage. Absolutely horrible and ruined my day/week.",1
"Phuket to Perth via Singapore. This was my first and last flight with Scoot. I was ill in Thailand and needed to return home early. I tried to change my flights at Phuket airport but Scoot staff were not interested and there was no manager available . They gave me a phone number to ring - no answer. They gave me another 2 numbers to ring - again no answer. The email address for Scoot did not work either - takes up to 10 days to answer. The next day, Scoot charged me 3 times the amount I paid for the flight home . So in addition to the flight which I did not use (7,880 bahts) , I was charged 23,700 bahts for the early flight home. This amounted to 31,500 bahts or AUS$1,278 for a one way flight to Perth from Phuket. Do not use this airline if you need to change flights. Avoid at all costs. I regret ever using them and never will again.",1
This airline should only be used in desperation as you last option. The ground staff which should be friendly and helpful treated me disrespectfully as if was my fault. I arrived at Sydney airport 40min before my 5.25pm scheduled departure for Melbourne and for several minutes was unsuccessfully trying to get my boarding pass using my Qantas Frequent Flyer Card at one of the automatic machines. When I was unable to get my boarding pass I approached the help desk. At the time I managed to speak with an assistant it was exactly 30 min before my scheduled Melbourne bound service. The service clerk informed me that I am now late for my flight and all other flights to Melbourne are fully booked and I can only fly the next morning. Being very unhappy with such treatment I informed the clerk that I will not be using Jetstar airline in future and then arranged my flight with Qantas for 6.30pm.,1
Early morning departure from Chennai to Delhi. Boarding process completed before time and on time push back. Clean aircraft with an efficient cabin crew. Landed on time in Delhi. One of the best airlines to fly in India.,0
Flight from Sydney to Launceston and return. Check in at both airports very quick and efficient. Boarding good. Paid for extra legroom and felt this worth the additional payment. Both flights departure and arrival on time.,0
"I travelled with Indigo today and my baggage is intentionally missing, because they have loaded connecting flights luggage. When asked they were very rude in how they treated you. This flight is not meant for human beings, its for animals. Horrible inflight and customer service. Don't know how airline Authority accepts such airlines.",1
I have just traveled Jetstar return Perth to Cairns Australia. Even for a sometimes cheap airline the planes are made for cheap travel. The seats are very thin hard plastic uncomfortable extremely close together made for short trips within Asia not the long legged Australians. The magazine holder has been shifted to the top of the seat to allow closer seats so expect a knee in the back the whole trip. The service was on a par with the planes very poor even by Qantas standards abrupt messy rushed food stale and poor quality.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Shenzhen. I came for an early flight to China at 610am, made sure there won't be any screw ups. Boarding gate was P1 on the boarding pass, and I waited for over an hour, and I realized things wasn't right when I do not see any crowd at the gate. Went to check on the screen and it shows the boarding gate is Q7, and it has closed.  Explained my situation to the staff, looked at me and said there's 3 other passengers with the same situation but they all boarded the flight. Other staff told me to work things out at the service counter. Went to the service centre and things went back and forth where it felt like they are trying to look for any fault in the customer. They gave me a replacement flight, which is at 420pm, and two RM20 meal voucher. The summary is that the replacement tickets are a courtesy/favour and I should appreciate it.",1
"Yogyakarta to Denpasar with AirAsia. I used Web check in and boarding pass printing at home and no baggage (although for domestic always include 15 kg baggage). Direct to departures after security check. Good boarding process. Nice livery. I pre order 2 pax food (nasi lemak and chicken dijon) and get free 2 drink (hot coffee and still water). Total price only IDR 67 k (USD 5) for delicious food and drinks. I eat one portion in the flight and one in waiting next flight. I always love flying with Air Asia Indonesia because if the humble flights attendant. Although this is low cost carrier, they work professionally and friendly, like full service airlines. And this is always better than AK or D7. Delay in departure, on time in arrival. And I get high fare, because I see 25% lower price several days before flying. Overall okay and worth it.",0
I travelled with my family from Melbourne to Bali by Jetstar the flight was scheduled at 10.15am and departed at Melbourne at 1pm. The carrier was 787 Dreamliner but very disappointed with the interior and you have to pay for everything. Then from Bali to Melbourne same Jerstar and the flight scheduled at 14.45 and when we reached airport for check in they said the flight is rescheduled at 20.00 due to engineering requirements. What a terrible service they are not even bothered to inform about their delays.,1
Adelaide to Sydney. We were late to the boarding gate (beyond our control) and the lady screamed at us like we were children. Not sure what side of the bed she woke up on but I would expect a bit more maturity from an adult woman. Seats weren't comfortable and leg room was barely the minimum. Next time I will pay extra and fly with an airline that treats its customers with respect.,1
"Melbourne to Singapore return. $5 for early check-in, changing date of flying without even proper explanation (simply an ordinary email), barely any service and delays up to 1 hour - not really for people who dislike delays, primitive service, awful communication and ridiculous extra costs. Not to mention the insincere attitude of the crew. Nevertheless their Boeing 787 seats have very good seat pitch. For small extra cost one can sit in the ""Scoot in Silence"" section which has better seats and proximity to business class (a few passengers simply went and sat there - crew didn't care). The more humid flight helped and atmospheric lighting of 787 made flying more interesting. Currently there's not many from Australia flying on Scoot, so I had 3 seats all to myself. This really enabled sleep.",0
"Sydney to Brisbane. This is a budget airline so I wasnt expecting bells and whistles. My flight was cancelled but I was put up overnight in a very pleasant hotel called The Branksome. We had a delicious buffet which was Indian curry. When I checked in the morning my workplace still went on without me and my business still exists. My customers understood these things happen. Given the choice of a maintenance issue with an aircraft and a cancelled flight with overnight accommodation and dinner provided, I will take the second option every time.  No complaints here.",0
"To be honest, my overall experience with this airline is disappointing. It is a budget airline but due to hidden additional charges, it actually is not a budget one. The most terrible experience is their customer service. You are wasting your time chatting with a chatbot. My tickets were canceled due to Covid last 2020 and 2021. Until now, I did not receive any refund. They just keep on saying the status is in progress and will escalate it.",1
I have traveled with Jetstar from Perth to Bali and return twice in the last 2 years. Both times were on an Airbus A320. Personally I found the seats in economy class quite OK compared to the economy seats on Qantas and Virgin who use Boeing 737's. Being a low cost carrier I made sure I read the fine print and terms and conditions. Once again as is so true in life you get what you pay for. Budget Airline means no frills and the bare basics unless you want to pay extra. As it is only a 3.5 hour flight I was more than happy to forgo the full services offered in exchange for a much cheaper fare. Both times Jetstar have provided a realistic service for the price paid. Aircraft was clean flight on time and fairly smooth. No real complaints. What I expected was met and I would much rather have the money I saved to spend on my holiday than enjoying all the perks of a full service carrier. Realistically it is only 3.5 hours out of your life! Will happily fly Jetstar again in the future on short haul flights.,0
JOG - CGK. I guess this airline is fair. Our flight was cancelled and the flight we were put onto was about 3 hours late (it was due to leave about 2 hours before our flight). But they were very efficient in transferring us onto another flight. They even got everybody a donut and water. So full credit to the Jogjakarta customer services.,1
"I sympathize with anyone who has negative experiences with airlines, and cannot speak for other flights, but we had a very positive experience with our AirAsia flight from Krabi to Singapore on February 2. Very smooth check-in, no problems with baggage, super clear announcements. Yes this is a budget airlines, so one should not expect, nor will they get, fancy (or any) food, or spacious seats. But AirAsia got us to our location safe and sound, and what's more on time, and that is all that matters to me.",0
I had my worst experience with this airline. I was booked from Manila to Cebu on 4/4/16 at 2300. My flight from Japan to Manila landed at 2200 instead of 2055 that night. I had to claim my baggage and I reached at the Cebu Pacific check in counter at 2230. The lady in the counter told me to rebook my ticket. I explained to her that it is not my fault that I was delayed and asked her to let me fly at their 2330 flight. She told me no and the staff in the ticketing counter told me to pay 4900 in addition to what I already paid. Another passenger told me that Cebu Pacific asked 8000 on a 1-way flight that night. It shocked me how heartless and cruel this airline is. They took advantage of the poor people in dire need of getting home that night. I swore not to get a ticket at Cebu Pacific and found a 5680 ticket at PAL.  I wasted more money that night for the hotel and the taxi that I booked to stay and to fetch me in Cebu without me. I also noticed that Cebu Pacific advertized a lower cost but you end up paying more with hidden fees.  I put 1 star for the rating which means zero to me since there was no option given for the zero.,1
"Singapore to Athens. I initially planned for a connecting flight 2 with a layover duration of 2 hours. Scoot however, revised their schedule a couple of weeks before my flight, reducing my layover time by 20 minutes. On the flight day, we saw that the flight was re-timed. We went to the check in counter to entire, but the counter staff were not even aware that the flight was re-timed. They checked and advised us that the flight departure time will be delayed by 2 hours, but the arrival time will remain the same, which is ridiculous. We went through the customs and went straight to the gate. The gate did not even display the updated flight time. There was no communication to the passengers, all waiting in vain and frustrated. No customer service representative came to address the issue. We called up the call center, which was outsourced, and they too, have no idea that the flight was re-timed. We went to confirm with the lounge staff, who advised us there was in fact a delay of 2 hours, arrival time will be delayed by another 2 hours too. We understand that the delay was due to the earlier flight being delayed, because they were waiting for 8 passengers who were performing their transit. In other words, Scoot opted to delay a whole plane full of passengers, just to accommodate to the 8 people. Very poor decision making and management on Scoot's behalf. While we were on the plane but yet to depart, the plane was being delayed for another hour. We understand that this was due to accommodating to the request of a single passenger who decided to disembark and then changed his mind to reembark again. This decision, again, costed the whole plane full of passengers another hour, just for the sake of a single passenger. We were seeking updates from the stewardess during the delay, but she does not have any clue as to what is happening, and she had this irritating habit of touching her hair once every 10 seconds or so. I missed my connecting flight eventually, and had to book another connecting flight. I wrote in to Scoot for the compensation. Their customer support team is outsourced, and have no clue that the flight was delayed. They kept insisting that the flight delay was less than 3 hours, until I requested them to show me the actual departure time and actual arrival time, versus the scheduled departure and arrival time. They kept replying with copy-and-pasted templates which added to my frustration. They have this ""promise to you"" page on their website which says that they will compensate with a travel voucher for any delay more than 3 hours. It has been more than a month since I raised this claim and till now, it has not been resolved. The issue being transferred from one customer service officer to another. Not too sure if they even intend to deliver this promise that they state on their website. Comprehensive travel insurance does not cover delay of less than 6 hours, but their customer service officer kept asking me to check with the insurance company for compensation. Scoot is an irresponsible airline, with poor customer service. With so many of Scoot's recent delays in the news, now I understand, this is of no surprise. Do avoid at all costs.",1
"Singapore to Nanjing. Scoot is a decent airline when they're on time, but the problem is that they often aren't, or force you to accept changes in their schedule at their mercy. Scoot offer a wide variety of destinations at a very competitive price point using very new aircraft, but the biggest problem with them is that they change their schedule often.",1
Flew from SYD-KUL return. Was quite happy with them on the first leg apart from the poor airport at LCCT on the return leg they changed the rules for cabin baggage denying both of us a second carrier bag allowed onboard. Very disappointing and rude ground staff. Very poor organisation. On the same flight staff failed to secure toilet doors before takeoff so they swung open abruptly. I'd avoid flying them again.,1
BOM-DEL-BOM. Early morning departure from Bombay was on time and a good flight. Very full both ways. Good check in services and very courteous staff. Good airline to fly domestic.,0
"I had to book this flight very suddenly due to an urgent issue and also due to the ongoing ATF prices for the airlines the prices were on the higher side. The online check in was a smooth process and as this was booked with a corporate fare, the seat selection was free. The baggage drop at the counter was a smooth and quick affair. Boarding started on time and the crew were able to discharge their duties well. For the corporate meal, I was pleased to note that the selection had increased from the last time and also included items like chicken noodles and biriyani along with tea, coffee, juices. The portions of the food were okay. The flight landed on time and the crew did not manage to wish goodbye and thank others but did wish me when I passed by which was appreciated. One thing to note was that the inflight magazine and the air sickness bag were not there on every seat and perhaps this is something that can be included on all seats as a feedback item. But otherwise, this was a good flight.",0
"The ticket was sold as Full flat, but it was without business class amenities. No business check-in line, not supporting TSA, no business lounge.",1
Departed Perth to Denpasar return with the family. No delays on either flight. Service was standard budget airline though much better than Ryan or Easyjet. My only complaint is regarding the unbelievably bad quality of the inflight hot meals. I pre ordered them to simply break the boredom for the kids and wish I hadn't bothered. Disgusting and simply inedible.,0
Flew on a short flight from Sydney to Ballina. We were on one of the older planes with very small leg room. Seats didn't recline and uncomfortable journey. Service was average nothing to note about. The return flight was much better on the new aircraft. Better comfort and leg room. Service the same.,1
We love Jetstar. Flew MEL-SIN on Friday 19th September. Flight was delayed by about 15 minutes but this time was made up. Check-in was seamless flight was comfortable. I was lucky enough to have a spare seat next to me. Cabin crew were friendly enough. Inflight entertainment was good but more variety would be appreciated particularly for children. It was a little frustrating that the cabin crew require photo ID for the inflight entertainment. Didn't have any photo ID besides my passport. A boarding pass sufficed but the flight attendant was not so happy I didn't have photo ID. Smooth landing in Singapore completed our pleasant experience with Jetstar. We brought our own snacks so didn't use their food and beverage service.,0
Chiang Mai to Macau. AirAsia ripped my suitcase after the flight and everything broken. I connect by AirAsia application and complain about it and I didnt received any advise after one week. They ignoring me. Please dont fly with this company.,1
Delhi to Bangalore. I was traveling with someone who was visually impaired. And when I reached the check in the girl on the other side was helpful to provide us with assistance.  She was excellent. She took good care of the specially enabled person with me and ensued that we were made to sit on the plane. Not only this she also helped so many passengers with all their queries. Keep it up and god bless you.,0
"So, we had a death in the family recently and in the last 3 days have had to use Jetstar 4 times for the Newcastle - Gold Coast leg. 3 out of 4 ran late, 2 of them significantly late. I'm on the 4pm flight right now, it's 6.40pm and we just had an announcement of a further 20 min delay. We might be taking off soon. Tonight, I must admit, I was at the end of my tether, and I took them to task during boarding. They threatened to remove me from the flight and the girl was very aggressive about it. I gather this is their system for controlling unhappy customers and it worked. I had to back down quickly or risk being stranded far from home with a child. Disgusted and shaken. It's the 23/5 if you want to see your employee in action Jetstar. Or is this your system?",1
"Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Even after adding in seat selection and 20kg of baggage, the price was still affordable and cheap considering that I only booked a month before the flight. There were problems with the self check-in as I had checked in online with AirAsia, luckily this was sorted out very quickly. Immigration at Changi Airport was very fast. The plane left on the dot at 7:35am and the gate my plane was at was the closest to the runway, so we were in the air very quickly. The seat pitch was just about okay for my height, and it was comfortable for a short flight. The plane was one of the older ones in AirAsia's fleet, not fitted with the sharklets seen on the newer A320s, and the cabin did show signs of ageingty. As it was a 40min flight and a budget airline, there was not much the cabin crew had to do but they were warm and friendly. One interesting perk about this flight was the ability to stream the inflight entertainment into my own device without needing to download a seperate app; all I had to do was to connect to the inflight WiFi which was enabled even on this short hop and I found it very unique, setting aside AirAsia from other budget carriers, and the selection was quite generous too, with some movies, documentaries and even games. The flight landed in Kuala Lumpur early and we had a short taxi into KLIA2, very quickly we were disembarking. Overall, given AirAsia's punctuality and cost, I would definitely pick AirAsia again if I'm travelling to Malaysia or want to travel on a budget.",0
Sydney to Melbourne. The second time I have flown with this airline with this one being the very worst of the two (closely followed by previous flight). We arrived at the domestic terminal as advised for them to tell us we are flying from the international terminal with no email or notification of this. This caused us to do a mad dash to the other terminal which was a taxi ride away. The flight was then late with airport staff in Melbourne seemingly unaware of our arrival as we were held for over 30 mins on the plane to get off. Will not being flying with Jetstar again.,1
"Melbourne to Proserpine. Regular traveler on this route. Jetstar provide good value for money. No issues at all with the flight and the Cabin Manager was fantastic and pleasant. The cheese and ham toastie is a winner for breakfast. I fly Jetstar regularly and never have any issues above what I would have with any other airline (e.g. delays etc). The only, small, issue is that they are constantly pushing to buy branded products.",0
OOL-SYD. Booked the 16.00 flight to find when I got to the airport that it was cancelled and I had been moved to the 19.20 flight! Not very helpful with infants. Crew acted like they didn't want to even be there. Food was overpriced and I knew that from my flight there so bought food at the airport for less then half the price. No entertainment offered onboard. Bring your own entertainment. Seat was very uncomfortable. Arrived at 22.00 and airport closing. No staff there to help us. Bags didn't turn up on carousel told our luggage would come with Qantas tomorrow afternoon!,1
The last time I flew Air Asia was when I returned back from Medan to Surabaya. It was a very long flight for an Indonesian domestic flight. More than 3 hours. It supposed to be a good flight but due to a delay my flight departed in the evening and I was devoid of scenery as it was dark. Seat pitch was not great for a flight longer than one hour. I had a mixed feeling over the food. The fried rice was terrible but the satay was great.,0
"What is it about Philippine airline companies that keeps them from providing in-flight entertainment? This was a 9 hour flight, and there was no entertainment available. Also there was no free meal service! I have never been on an international flight that had neither free meals and entertainment. I asked for a cup of coffee and was charged about $2.50USD. The crew were kind and courteous, the plane seemed in good condition and was clean, however, I will not fly on Cebu Pacific (or Philippine Airlines ~ also no in-flight entertainment) again.",1
"As a first time flyer on Jetstar to Phuket I was pleasantly surprised. Flights out of Sydney always seem to leave late no matter which airline I have flown and this flight's departure was no exception.  The crew were very good as was the quality of the food, headphones and online movies. The bathrooms were clean. The outbound flight received a few complaints about running out of cheesecake for dessert but that was not the crew's fault. I flew business class which is not the same as business class on other airlines but comparable. The under leg supports only came up to mid calf which was very uncomfortable. The inbound flight check in crew and arrangements for check in at Phuket airport, did puzzle me. All business class and economy class passengers were in the same queue which is not normal. As Jetstar is a subsidiary of Qantas I expected fairly fluent English to be spoken at the airport. They were polite but understanding of English was far from good. All people checking in were from Europe or Russian and they all communicated in English. They looked at my passport and asked me if it was ""New"" when it clearly showed in it that it had been issued in 2013. It did not show up on their system which was strange as it did when I had arrived two weeks earlier. One very helpful staff member called the Australian Embassy for clearance. The only error made was the announcement by one of the cockpit crew when we were descending in to Sydney. He was English speaking but announced that we were ""Ascending"" which I found quite amusing.",0
"Jakarta to Denpasar and a complete disaster with Lion Air. The flight was 1.5 hours late with no information provided at all. When asked, ground staff shrugged, were rude and said they don't know. All this for a 9pm flight. On the airplane itself, they said the lateness was due to ""operational reasons"". I will never fly them again and wouldn't recommend them either.",1
"Worst low-cost airline I have ever experienced. No complimentary meal or free water. Prepaid wifi did not work on either flight. Airline staff asked customers to remove headphones for landing and take off, not just for safety briefings. My flight was delayed with no email or text message notification. After the delay, there was a further 30 minute delay to board the aircraft. I wouldn't recommend this airline.",1
"Launceston - Sydney 22/3/13. Arrived at airport 7pm for 8.15 departure only to read departure board - flight delayed until 9.35. No texts sent to advise prior. At 9pm the board indicated ""Flight Cancelled"" - no announcement until 5 mins later! Mad scramble to line up for vouchers. Had to organise own taxis. Given $35 voucher for food/drink and $15 for b/f. Next morning back to airport for 10 am departure. By 9.50 still not boarding - no announcements. Finally on board 10.05 - no apologies - then sat on tarmac until 10.40. Departed and finally Captain announced at 11am ""sorry for delay"". Staff advised that ""due to no catering in Launceston there is no fresh food available nor ice for drinks"". Only good thing was they have given us a $100 voucher off next flight (dare I chance it again).",1
Narithtra and Apiwal helped me alot during my check in even though I was misguided by airport staff they both looked after me to change my flights and provided me excellent customer service. Thank you Air Asia to have such great skilled customer service representative who looks after customer and provides great customer service.,0
"I accidentally interchanged the boarding date and ended up messing up my flight tickets FOR jUNE 2019. My tickets were under the category which cannot be rescheduled, so I panicked as the amount I paid was over 20000 rupees and with my previous experience with domestic airlines, I was sure I am losing all the money and would be asked to re-book the entire journey. Much fortunately, I called Indigo and got connected to this very helpful person who was so patient with my panic state and assisted me with all my queries and infact rescheduled the tickets considering they were booked a few minutes ago. I cannot thank this person and Indigo enough to explain how helpful they were towards my situation and how efficiently they fixed this issues.",0
"Ayers Rock to Sydney. Check in was straight forward. Boarding, due to the late arrival of the airplane, the small airport terminal got very crowded and overflowing. There were not enough seats at one time. The boarding was a straightforward process. Many of the passengers were children. There was much activity on the seats and on the aisle. As it was not a full flight, I had to seek a quiet area in the plane. I guess, the activity was allowable or else the cabin crew would have taken action. The cabin crew were not as attentive as in a comparable QANTAS internal flight. The plane looked new and it appeared clean and fresh. Arrival, the baggage arrived soon after. We had hoped to avoid the Sydney rush hour, but because of the flight delay, we were in the middle of the rush hour. It took us longer to get to our hotel than expected.",0
PER-KUL-HND in April with my 2 year old son. The flights were fine on time and pleasant for the fare paid. However two weeks ago received an email from Air Asia stating that my return KUL-PER flight 26 May has been cancelled - 'for commercial reasons'. Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'. Service recover for whom? Formerly loyal Air Asia customers. No longer.,1
"Friendly ground staff at Syd. But highly intoxicated large male passengers allowed to board by flight crew. One constantly yelling out ""sticks"" (slang for guns) along with other stupid behavior. Asked once to behave but not enforced later. Not wearing masks. Asked once to wear mask and complied for less than 1 minute. Never asked again on 3 hour flight. Complained to Jetstar who replied I should've alerted staff. Was sitting very close to front so no way they weren't aware. Should have been dealt with in the 10 minutes after boarding while we sat waiting for final departure paperwork.Why should I do their work for them and put myself at risk of aggressive behaviour. Shocked by Jetstars disinterested response. A horrible, scary 3 hour long experience on an airline that seems to put revenue before safely.",1
"I only had a short flight from Singapore to Denpasar with AirAsia but they were excellent. They were very helpful at check in with barely any queue, polite and friendly staff, and excellent choice of meals which were good quality.",0
"Dreadful in every sense of the word. Two flights were summarily canceled by text message in the last ten days: No apology, no reason given. Lion Air cares nothing for their passengers and customer service is non-existent. Quite apart from having our flights canceled, we paid 1.3J for PCR tests (that's about 77 each) which were then rendered useless. If you have a choice who to fly with, go with anyone else but LionAir.",1
"Yangon to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur, and they refused to let me check my luggage all the way through so was forced to spend an hour and a half at KLIA2 queuing. Then when I got to the bag drop, the man said I was too early and if I left my bag they would lose it! I checked this several times and he confirmed 'yes, we will lose it, it won't make it to Sydney'. When I asked why, he said 'because no one will look after it'. So, can't get to the hotel I booked and have had to pay again to use a lounge to escape the noise.",1
"I received an SMS to check in, but then I received a message the afternoon before that my flight was cancelled. They gave me an alternative flight in the afternoon but that would have been useless since I would have missed a concert. So I had to desperately look for last minute flights on other airlines. Very expensive at the last minute. I will only fly again if I have no other choice. At least I got a quick refund.",1
Coimbatore to Delhi. First of all thank you for such a caring staff. My daughter met with an accident and her left arm was affected.  She was carrying extension rod attached to her arm. We were having three tickets but of different nos. Air hostess took proper care for arranging front seats for us. She helped her relax throughout the journey.,1
"The flight was on time as was the return trip. Cant complain with the airline. The only issue I had was the legroom in economy as I am over 6 foot, but its pretty much the same for every airline these days. No IFE so you have to bring your own or a book like I did. Any food or drink purchases are by card only, so beware they don't take cash. All in all I got what I paid for knowing its a budget airline (I paid extra for baggage and to choose my seat) and would fly them again.",0
"We returned home on Jetstar having previously flown to Vietnam via Singapore on economy. What was the difference between the two flights. Jetstar Business class allowed you to board first, just like any airline would. You got bigger seats with a lot more room, though the seats were uncomfortable. We were offered a glass of sparkling wine that tasted like petrol with added co2. At 11.30 at night, the choice of meals were potato gnocchi or a cold chicken salad, a small very sweet cake, but a nice roll and butter. We both asked for a beer and were left somewhat bemused by what can only be described as a 150ml glass of beer each. Breakfast was nothing to write home about, nice roll and butter though. All in all, we had a more relaxing flight on the out bound economy flight. The service was better and the food was a lot better, and I managed to have a beer all to myself. Never again Jetstar, Never Again.",1
I have flown Cebu Pacific every 3 months for more than 10 years booking both international and domestic routes through them. Yes there had been occasional issues but nothing like what is happening currently. I had booked a direct Bangkok to Cebu route several months ago for a flight for the end of this month March. On Feb 18th Cebu notified me that this route had been cancelled but they would offer me a BKK-MNL-CEBU route and return at no extra charge. I told them that the BKK-Manila they were offering me departing Bangkok at 12.30 in the morning arriving in MNL at 4.50am and then a multi-hour layover in MNL before the late morning flight to Cebu (total flying and ground time of around 9 hours) was not convenient to me and could I take the mid-morning departure from BKK and connection from there. Answer no. I asked if I could take the early morning routing they were suggesting but take a two day layover in MNL (at my own expense) so I could rest and then continue on the late night flight to Cebu. Answer no. They insist I must take the inconvenient departure time and complete my travel in one day. I have booked Philippine Air for my return because they are virtually the same fare price no add-ons and have a much more convenient schedule for this route. Where Cebu Pacific had been my first airline of choice now they will be my last.,1
"Honolulu to Osaka. Scoot far exceeded our expectations on every account. We were skeptical of flying a cut rate airline and read a lot of (good and bad) reviews prior to booking, but we couldn't turn down the bargain price, so we expected the worst and hoped for the best. We figured it might be an adventure in traveling, that was worth saving the couple thousand dollars we would have spent on a mainstream airline. The only trick was I wasn't able to book a one way ticket on their website, so booked it though Kiwi.com. No complaints about Kiwi.com - everything went according to plan. Seats are not assigned in advance, nor could you check in online, but we arrived early and so check-in was easy, the people were pleasant and our seats were assigned together. Note that they will weigh your bags so pack according to their specifications. The plane was a brand new Boeing 787 - (amazing technology) - it had comfortable reclining seats, and we actually were able to spread out as there were empty seats next to us. You need to bring your own entertainment or download the scoot app for movies before you get on the flight (which I didn't know until we were onboard). The food is ala cart and on demand, which was nice. There were many options, and while the food isn't cheap I was happy to pay $18 for decent airline food after saving hundreds of dollars on the flight. The flight was smooth and the stewardesses were professional. We arrived a little early and the light show as we landed was a fun touch. The only thing we are sad about is that we didn't fly Scoot earlier and that Scoot will be discontinuing service to Honolulu in June 2019. Better go while you can take advantage of great prices!",0
Flew Cebu Pacific 5 times last month mostly on short-haul international flights (CEB-HKG MNL-HAN REP- MNL). All flights on time aircraft clean new aircraft lovely crews with even warm automated announcements.,0
"Very bad food. Small portion size. No alcohol served - paid service. I did to and from in Indigo, both times the food quality was very poor. It is not expected for international airline. Seats and service were also sub-par. In-flight entertainment was not working for any passenger.",1
Flew BKK-SIN-BKK. Simply the best low-cost experience I've had. The flight was simply perfect from very clear online sales (unlike Air Asia and other airlines with unclear pricing and everything piles on at the end). Using a wide body is not an issue but the seats and the seat pitch was very generous more than legacy carriers - The seat pitch was incredible. Crew very young but professional. Good selection of food and drinks on board. Hoping they'll add frequencies to Bangkok as they currently have only 1. Recommending them for sure.,0
"Indigo was utterly careless in handing a sensitive item like infant / baby child restraint system (CRS) and caused damage even after we safely handed it to them at the gate.  The bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination. The bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly. We use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues.  It is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k INR due to Indigo's shoddy handling. We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later. We later found out that leaving the airport without PIR means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold Indigo liable anymore. Indigo was careless with sensitive luggage items like a car seat and did not offer a fair resolution even after they were made aware.",1
"I'm reviewing a booking, not an actual flight: I booked Denpasar - Manila on 15/11/2016, with a 2 hour transit at KL. Some days afterwards I received an e-mail from AirAsia saying the flight from Denpasar / KL was rescheduled leaving me 10 minutes between flights. There were 2 links: One for a telephone number which I called and whose lady said she couldn't help. Another for a chat that was consistently unavailable for 2 days. Also a e-form, which I used twice, but with no answer. The email itself couldn't be answered. After several tries on at least two days and two hours (in total) waiting, I managed to contact the live chat. I found out they would keep my money at least one month, if I'd cancel and ask for a refund. I had to search for alternative flights myself,on AirAsia website while chatting - they didn't help on any regard. In between, the chat was timed-out. So I had to wait again and managed to change the flight to the only option that allowed me to arrive on time at Manila. That forced me to stay overnight at KL. AirAsia didn't offer any compensation for that. I'm still waiting for the next e-ticket, and for the next chapter of this nightmare.",1
"Jakarta to Denpasar. I will not book Lion Air ever again. They just emailed us that our flight is moved to an earlier flight but we cannot make it because we live far from the airport. When we called after a gazillion times - they asked us to pay additional charges if we want to move our flight. That is totally wrong because they just informed us hours before our flight and they are the ones who moved our flight first not us. We ware unable to contact them even if we called, emailed, facebook messaged, instagram messaged, chat and all. Their service is very poor and they do'nt accomodate their passengers at all. We also asked for the advisory during the Mount Agung eruption but they did not advice and they only told us that there are no threats at all even if other airlines already allowed flight change. Never ever book in this airlines if you want a convenient flight. They are unreasonable, rude and only wants your money.",1
"I reviewed the food and the flight a few days ago and have also been interested to read the reviews of so many others but one thing has caught my attention: not once has Jetstar taken the time to respond to any of the comments. All companies monitor these sites, It's part and parcel of modern-day businesses, yet there is no input from Jetstar. What does this tell us? For me, it's a sign of disinterest and complete arrogance. Sad really that they hold their client base in such disregard and contempt.
Editor Note: Jetstar were offered the opportunity many times to quick-link respond to their customer feedback, but chose not to do so.",1
Flown Manila-Naga route several times in the last month. All in all we found it to be barely average. The focus is not on customer satisfaction and I would only fly with them again if I had no other choice.,1
Scoot Business really means Premium Economy with one spicy Asian meal and one drink included no bread roll salt or pepper etc - very basic food indeed. After that there is a charge for everything. Try to carry your own water as its not provided - especially on longer flights. The seats are OK but difficult for sleeping. Our Singapore to Gold Coast flight was delayed an hour before any explanation was given to passengers. The flight eventually departed 1.5 hrs late.,1
"Melbourne to Coolangatta flight was to leave Melbourne at 10.10 - at 9.45 advised there would be an hour delay after an hour we were told flight still delayed and no definite time of departure waiting on engineer! Finally at 2.00pm we boarded the flight and after 10 mins told ""sorry same problem again"" and we all had to go back into terminal while they prepared another plane. I was travelling with my elderly mother and those stairs are killers. Our flight finally left Melbourne at 3.00pm arriving Coolangatta at 5.00pm. This ruined our afternoon of prepared travel & our holiday in general. Flew home Tiger with no problems.",1
Flew Melbourne to Sydney. The Jetstar Airways is the worst airline that I have come across in last 15 years of regular flying experiences. Their staff at check-in are not nice and are inconsiderate. The flights are almost always invariably delayed. The flights regularly get cancelled. The cabins can be untidy and are not clean.,1
"Sydney to Perth with Jetstar Airways. We had the worst flight ever. It wasn't even particularly cheap! The flight was delayed 2 and a half hours with no warning. Told at bag check it was due to bad weather? It was fine weather. Told at check in the delay was 1 and a half hours. That was a lie. Once on the plane we waited on tarmac for 20 plus minutes to get someone's bags off. Pilot made no mention of bad weather. He told passengers he was sorry for the delay. Said they had been running late all day and now this flight was very delayed. Plane was almost full. 3x3 seats. Old plane felt so cheap and old fashioned like you might find in developing nations. There was no service after first offer of food and drinks, all charged for and running out of choice. My seat was so cramped. It had hardly any padding. I used my coat to save my back as chair back was so thin the ""wires"" stuck into me. It was so cramped I didn't leave my seat for the whole flight. A big man had the aisle seat and he slept the whole flight. I was dehydrated so could ""hang on"". My husband and I are slim. His backside ached the whole trip. I have just got back from the physio as my neck is out! My thighs have ached badly all day yesterday. After all the delays there was no sweetener like a free drink. I asked for water on the one and only service run. The staff member suggested I have a glass, as a bottle was $4. We got one small plastic cup of water. Nothing else. Never again. Qantas should be ashamed to be associated with this disgraceful airline. So mean spirited.",1
I have flown six times with Air Asia this year and have found it to be a good airline for the price. The staff are friendly and the check-in staff have been helpful. The planes are always clean and comfy. The only down side to Air Asia is their KL terminal. The terminal is confusing the flights are nearly always late and the walk from the terminal to the plane can be long (especially if it is windy and raining). But for friendliness cleanliness and price I would recommend Air Asia.,0
I logged in to my account to use club JetStar membership but JetStar without any notification logged me out as club JetStar allows only 5 tickets and I was purchasing 10 tickets. Jetstar could not able to provide an evidence that I was not logged in and advised cannot refund the difference.  I was on the phone for an hour and chatted to explain that since I a club JetStar member than you should be able to adjust the fund by marrying up my ticket details with my account. I have never experienced such a bad customer service from JetStar in past and from any other Australian company. I paid $55 membership and JetStar decided to argue with me for an hour just to take $100 from me by ruining the reputation and not caring for its loyal customer.  Even an idiot can understand that one member purchased tickets and missed the discount which she is entitle for to give it other. This kind of business model may be good for short term but in the long run it will lose its capability and will be out of the market. No concept of goodwill gesture for loyal customer. Monopoly business model.,1
"Flew AirAsia from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur. I have flown with Airasia for a year now and I travel often. Their customer service is the worst, its really hard to contact them. Online there is over an hour wait and there are always issues. AirAsia tries to charge for everything it can think of, even for making a payment. Cheap, but not worth all the trouble.",1
"Singapore to Melbourne. We have traveled with Jetstar before from Hawaii business class and we said, never again. Now we were traveling from Singapore on a new airline the Boeing 787 and thought this time it would be okay. Again we purchased a Business Class ticket. We came off a cruise and were taken to the airport 9 hours before our flight. We went to Qantas/Jetstar Business Lounge, where we were told we are not allowed to enter as we are not Qantas Club members (we could join for $600 ea!) and we were supposed to purchase some kind of package when we bought our Business Class ticket to allow us to use the Lounge. I said, no problem, I will purchase it now, but was told it can only be done online when you purchase the tickets! So no matter that I paid all that extra money on a Business class, we were not allowed to use the Business Lounge. This is the first and only airline who did this, we never had this problem before. On the plane, the Business Class is like the Premium Economy of other airlines. Virtually no leg room, seats are very narrow, nothing like a Business Class seat should be. Extremely disappointed, will never travel with Jetstar again and won't recommend it to anybody.",1
I book for a 6am flight from Manila to Hong Kong and when I wanted to check in they replace it by one at 3pm on a Wednesday ! So i called the customer service : 15 minutes trying to convince me it was my mistake then i had to find back the original booking email. 30 minutes telling me there is no flight till the evening. I had to check a e-travel agency to prove them it was a lie. A bad and stressing experience.,1
Singapore to Sydney Nov 2013. Left on time both directions. Got yellow seats for extra space and it was worth it for additional leg room. Service was OK but cool and not very welcoming. Meals which we ordered in advance are poor and don't recommend them other than the Sandwiches and pot noodles which you can buy 'on the go'. The plane was full both ways. The worst experience was the freezing cabin on both flights so much so we became convinced that this was done to 'encourage' us to invest in renting pillows and blankets. I would look for an alternative service for future flights.,1
Myself and partner flew Sydney to Cairns return. From the international terminals we could purchase sandwiches and muffins on the forward trip but they only had Mars bars or crisps on the return trip at 7am in the morning. Pretty ordinary for a 3 hour flight. The seat in economy on the A330 are very tight my knees were on the seat in front flight attendants never smile. Never again.,1
I flew with them from Bangalore to Pune recently. Ground staff at Bangalore airport were a bit disorganized but managed to get us on board fast. Seat was fairly ok but if you are a large person you will feel very uncomfortable as the armrests on this airline did not go up. After take off we were offered drinks despite Indigo being a budget airline. I felt a little hungry halfway through the flight and I manger to get a packet of chips for a cheap price. After which we landed in Pune fresh and nourished. Overall Indigo I feel has service that is better than any other budget airline that I knew.,0
"When it comes to low cost airlines i have mixed feelings. Jetstar is great for short haul such as Syd to Mel, but when I flew JetStar long haul economy (Bangkok to Melbourne), the experience was terrible. I had flown JetStar short haul before and found it average, so when i was returning from Melbourne I decided to purchase the starter Max fare. (The Jetstar Short haul business class equivalent) the price was reasonable. i was driven to the airport in a private car (not part of Jetstar business class,) there was water and free mints. i arrived at terminal 4 on the way in i found a WHsmith store and bought a Jetstar A320 model plane. once i had checked in I tried to ask a Jetstar staff member about how to acess the food voucher the staff member was rude so i asked another staff member who answered my question. To go to the lounge i had to walk all the way to terminal 1 to find the Qantas lounge. they offered plates of salami and fruit but i went to the hot meal area, I got pasta bolognese and outrageously tiny piece of cake. I realised that the departure time was earlier than expected so i had to head to the gate the terminal where my gate was was appalling the ceilings were low and the gate was packed i got in line we got through the plane via stairs (the A320 is smaller than i thought) i got in through the front my seat was 2F at the front I got on and the plane taxied to the runway we took off (its quiet at the front) when we were at cruising altitude the crew started serving food and beverages. I had a voucher for free food it was a dinner flight but unfortunately it didn't offer meals. I got a hot chocolate a chocolate muffin and a take home blanket, the seat was leather with orange lining there was no usb port. Overall the flight was great if you are looking for affordable luxury, Jetstar business class is your airline",0
"Scoot is another budget airline which operates from Singapore, and is a competitor of Jetstar Asia. It's affiliated with Singapore Airlines. It pays to pay for board me first, which givers you priority check in to beat the long queue, as well as being amongst the first to board first, so that you may secure overhead locker's space. Service is great, in many ways no different to some regular airlines. The meals however, is an area which they don't really shine. It's ok, just that it cannot compare with Jetstar Asia, which excels in this area. Other than that, everything is just the same, get you from A to B at a reasonable price (but do shop around first). At both SIN and HKG airports, aero bridge is used, which adds value to the flight experience.",0
Bought my ticket at a very cheap price. I love flying on this kind of plane. Simple and not much passenger due to limited number of seats. Our flight departed 30 minutes early. It was a flight nothing to write home about but the price was the game changer. Overall it was a good flight considering the situation we are all in.,0
"Bangkok to Lombok. I purchased 2 tickets with Airasia, during December to use during the month of March. Of course, during this outbreak, the flights have been cancelled. I have tried to understand that Airasia must have busy times, that everything is chaos. Said all that, its embarrassing how customer support and the answers you receive from the airline. Not Malaysia Airlines, not Jetstar, none of the competitors of AirAsia, have just played dumb and get away with the cancellation. Malaysia Airlines in 5 minutes just changed the dates of my flights, the same with the other airlines. Under the same circumstances, AirAsia has just closed my claims (they recommend to just move flight or ask for credit). All my requests have been closed and told that ""I am not eligible for the credit). Tried Ava: yep. Terrible. System thors constant errors. Where you able finally to lodge a case? Yep. Suddenly all cases closed. Tried calling the call center: Yep. 1 hour on the phone to India. And they only discuss local flights. Still waiting for an answer. Worst customer service And from my side, never again!",1
6E 427 BOM-MAA and 6E 278 MAA-BOM. Airplanes were clean boarded on time arrived on time (may be even a shade early) crew were friendly and helpful. Food items requested were available and tasty. Only negative is that service on board was slow leaving no time for inflight sales.,0
December 2013 I flew 5 CPA flights Bangkok - Manila return and 3 internal flights. All were on time leaving FA were polite and attentive so for a budget airline my experience was excellent. I really do not understand why people complain about this airline so much as I have used them in the past and will continue to use them in the future if they keep providing such good value for money.,0
"Bengaluru to Jaipur. I had done web check in and had my boarding pass as pdf in my phone as I couldn't get a print out. Upon reaching the airport I was not allowed to print the boarding pass, they didn't have to give the boarding pass, just print the pdf that I had. The worst part is if they had not wasted my time in queues when I had already mentioned I was in a hurry, I could have gone outside and gotten a printout. I missed my flight just because I didn't have a printout of my boarding pass, even though I had the pdf. There has to be some understanding, they should guide us properly.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Siem Reap. Although I live in Malaysia, I have always opted for full-fare travel. Today was my first flight with AirAsia. And it was not bad at all! Nothing like the ""bus station"" nightmare I had in my head for so many years. Nice terminal, no bussing around, elegant leather seats, attractive but well-trained crew, decent Asian meals and overall a youthful and energetic vibe. Well done! I deduct one point for the autopilot-y landing whereby we slammed down on the runway pretty hard.",0
"This is maybe the 8th time I've flown Scoot, and the 7th for Scootbiz - I'm writing this review on the way to Singapore. The subject line should be ""They Could Do So Much Better"". Great new airline, friendly staff, good quality seating, but their systems are completely outdated. If you are going to offer wifi and scootTV, then do the basics and make sure they work. The wifi logins with partners don't work, so even if you have a valid account, you still have to pay each time you board. And ScootTV, just deplorable, really bad. If you're just interested in the seat leg and arm room, they're great. If you want to actually watch something, forget it. Do not exceed your baggage limitation as they will screw you at $21/kg.",1
"A Jetstar flight was booked for me by a travel agency as part of a package from Vienna to the Cook Islands. Flying with this company was the worst experience of my travel life. The ticket was unreasonably expensive and cost 1/5 of the total amount for the entire trip. Auckland to Rarotonga was already delayed for almost 2 hours without an answer as to why. I sat in seat 1A and the seat was reasonably comfortable. After take-off, the flight proceeded normally. The food served on board the plane was bad as I expected. The flight was turbulent, but the staff handled it very well. On the flight back, they informed us that 27 pieces of baggage were not on the plane. That we don't have to worry about our baggage. I checked in 2 pieces of luggage and both were lost. I dealt with the situation at the airport in Auckland, because I flew back to Vienna on January 10, 2023. One piece of my luggage was returned to me after 42 days  damaged and I had to pick it up at the Vienna airport. Everything was soaked and moldy as if it had been soaked in water for a long time. Communication with customer service is complicated and without real answers. In the e-mails, they claimed to have found the luggage and asked for the delivery address. I have not yet received compensation. Despite the increased expenses as we had to buy new winter clothes for the trip back. Not to mention damaged luggage. The second piece of lost luggage was not delivered to me and I still do not have an answer when it will be delivered to me. The only thing I can positively evaluate is the onboard staff, who are pleasant despite the total incompetence of the airline.",1
Auckland to Wellington on JQ255. We were informed that our flight is now delayed for two hours without any prior notification. It happened about 30 minutes before we were supposed to board. No compensation or food vouchers were offered. I cant say that their staff was helpful. There was another flight to Wellington departing at the time of our delay but we were not offered an option to catch it. Delays look like a regular thing with Jetstar.  I wont recommend them if you on a tight schedule.,1
"Flew from Delhi to Srinagar. AirAsia has always been my least preferred airline. Again I regret travelling by this airline. The customer service and support is zero. I needed to take a medicine and asked for water by pressing the Assistance button above our seat. The air hostess came and asked me what I needed, I said water. Then very conveniently she forgot that. I mean do they teach them the meaning of that button? Very unfortunate that such a big name has such poor quality service. Thank you for giving me another reason as to why I am definitely not going to travel AirAsia again.",1
"I had a horrible experience with Indigo. My flight was from Goa to Kozhikode and had a 5 hour layover in Banglore. We landed in Banglore at 12:00 am and the flight to Kozhikode was not until 5:05 am boarding time. The boarding pass did not show the gate and the tv screens in the airport didnt show the gate until 5:00 am. We got to the gate at 5:15 and they said go to another counter quickly, from there they said quickly follow Indigo employee assuming he is trying to get us on the flight, instead he stamps the tickets and walk us out to the ticket counter. We waited an hour with 50-60 other people who missed their flight. When we got to the counter they said the next flight is not until tomorrow and its and additional 5000 rs for the tickets. Best thing to do is take a ""luxury bus"" to your location if you miss a flight in India. I would advice to never fly this airline, customer service is horrible also.",1
"I was totally impressed by the service I got on an Indigo Flight while traveling from Doha to Cochin. The food served, and the quality of service from the ground staff as well as the cabin crew was amazing. Moreover the efforts to make IndiGo the coolest airline has worked. I'm happy as a IndiGo user.",0
"Third time we experienced delays. Crew seem confused, no clear information. Must rely on internet to learn the reality of the delay period.",1
SIN-KUL-VTE return all flights on A320. The flights were okay but not clean though. There was gum in my seat pocket. Crew members were pleasant on all flights except one on the VTE-KUL route.,0
"My flight from Amritsar to Singapore was late around 7 hours. None of passengers were informed. End up missing my second flight Singapore to Sydney, at airport I was told that my next flight is after two days.  End up buying another ticket with Malaysia Airlines via Kuala Lumpur. Cost me another $1200. Made a complaint, no return my call.",1
"The worst customer service experience with any airline so far coming from someone who has visited almost 40 countries with both budget and business class airlines. Flight cancelled less than 24 hours before departure, spent more than 4 hours on the phone with different representatives trying to get a boarding pass for a replacement ticket and only went in circles with their staff.",1
"Sydney to Melbourne. Absolutely frustrated! Our flights were the most expensive part of our 3 day trip and was the most disappointing experience! First off our flight on Monday 7am was cancelled with no explanation we had to sit at the airport from 5:30am to 1pm, we didnt get to Melbourne until the afternoon (one day taken up sitting at a airport). then we get to the airport on Wednesday at 1:30 for our 4:30 flight home and 4:10pm the flight gets delayed again, expected departure 6:15 come around to 6pm and its delayed again. Didnt fly out until 7:30pm, no compensation given! Never again will we fly with Jetstar!",1
"Adelaide to Perth on the 14th of June with Jetstar Airways. Flew on a relatively new Airbus A320, when compared to some of the older ones in the fleet. Although I was seated close to the front (8D), the seat was unbelievably tight in terms of seat pitch, which is okay for shorter flights like Melbourne/Sydney, but for a longer flight Id try and buy an exit row seat next time! Crew were okay, but nothing to write home about. The customer service manager wasnt overly pleasant when she informed me of my $15 voucher (as Id purchased a Starter Plus fare). I had purchased this fare for the bargain basement price of $99 (plus $45 for the starter plus bundle), so I cant complain too much. It was good value for what Id paid, but there are better airlines around for only a few quid more.",0
"Melbourne to Singapore with Scoot. Check in was ok, but passengers were made to wait inside the airbridge for almost 10 minutes. The new Boeing 787 aircraft had a layer of black dust on its ventilation slots above passengers' heads. A stewardess told me that they try to turn around the aircraft so fast that there is no time for proper cleaning. The toilet sink was also blocked for most of the flight. Premium selection meal was okay, but very small. The only solace was the real cheap fare that I paid for the flight.",1
"Flew Sydney to Melbourne - JQ527, then scheduled to fly to Perth on JQ970 two weeks later. SYD - MEL flight was good, and I can't see myself ever paying extra to fly QF or VA for an hour hop. Everything had to be paid for, but honestly, I didn't mind - you close your eyes and you're there. Seats themselves were not very well padded, but that's to be expected. Legroom was ideal, coming from a semi-tall bloke. Bags came out quickly, had an on-time departure and arrival, service was great. That's to be expected, and from someone who had never flown them before, I felt that what everyone always says about them is misguided - it's a budget airline after all. We took the Skybus from St Kilda to Tullamarine - the last of the day @ 8 pm, so we had to wait around the airport for a bit. However, for a $20.50 fare for two adults (special), the convenience and not having to catch public transport was worth it. Check-in at Tullamarine was easy, as was bag drop, went through security, only to find our flight had been cancelled due to the crew timing out (read - legally worked too long that shift to be able to operate the onward flight) - so, back through the terminal and waiting in a line for help. Thank god we got there when we did, because the queue stretched for ages right after we arrived. The good thing is, it's super easy to change your flight when it's cancelled. We originally changed our flight to a 6:05 am departure with Jetstar, but seeing the provided accommodation was in Preston - a good 45mins away by taxi, we tried to get a better flight - also seeing that people had been able to change to Qantas flights. They are constantly loading more flights and options into the system in the event of a cancellation, so we asked to see if there was anything better they could do for us, and it turns out that there was a Virgin flight the next day leaving at 9AM. This suited us, and we were set. The accommodation they provided was great - fairly modern and gave us meal vouchers to use at the hotel - we used them for breakfast, which was okay, but I would use them for dinner depending on when you need to go there if you're in the same situation. They also reimburse you for any taxi services you need to get to and from the airport - however you need to coordinate this yourself after the journey is done. However, the lady coordinating the giving out of hotels at Tullamarine was rude. Too sassy for her own good, we tried making conversation with her and all she could do was give snarky comments back - when she was literally doing her scheduled job (write people's names down on a list), at her normal shift time. We're the ones being delayed here - you're getting paid. Cut the attitude. However, everyone else at the service desk was friendly, which was good. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Jetstar again given my experience on the first flight, but it's also good knowing they have a good system for cancellations - you're covered even if they're unable to fly. And, for paying $150pp incl bag, getting a free hotel, taxi service, and a widebody Virgin flight the next day with inc food and entertainment was great value for money. Thanks for cancelling my second flight, Jetstar. It couldn't have gone better, for me at least :)",0
I flew to Bali from Sydney for $88 on 23 April 2015. The flight left 10 minutes late and arrived 33 minutes early. The plane was the new Boeing Dreamliner and I managed to secure a window seat without paying extra. This new plane had sufficient leg room and seat width for me. I am 178 cm tall and weigh 96 kg. The earphones plug into the back of the headrest in front of you. There is also a USB socket next to the earphones jack. The windows of this plane darken gradually but there is a button underneath the window to lighten them. For the first time the Jetstar ground staff did not ask to see a ticket out of Indonesia even though I was not flying out of Indonesia with Jetstar. I only took a cabin bag which weighed 9.7 kg. The Jetstar ground staff let the bag through as I had purchased the ticket in October. Nowadays Jetstar only allows a maximum of 7 kg for cabin luggage. Onboard I purchased a red wine cheese and crackers package for $A10. Overall a very pleasant flight.,0
"AirAsia cancelled / postponed my flight and allowed for one time change of schedule for free and this is all done through their chatbot called AVA. however, I made a mistake by choosing wrong departure date, this isn't fixable by their chatbot, but I found a way to actually get in touch with real human customer service through the chat service. Had to wait for an hour of 200 people queuing, when it finally my chance, I wrote my inquiries and they just disconnected without answer. It happened TWICE. Like what other reviewers said, be careful with customer service of this airline, as it is basically non existent. Not reachable by phone either. They will either let you speak with a chatbot or refer you to a human agent that just don't care and disconnect you at will.",1
