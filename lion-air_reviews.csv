One time 15 kg, the other 20 kg, which makes you pay every time. Obviously 15 kg for a check in luggage is not enough at all. Always late, cancelled or problems with the airplane. Ridiculous company really We did take it a few times in indonesia (booked in advance) and it was horrific Nearly missed a connection flight because they are late! We took 6 flights and no 1 was on time  My knees touch the seat in front of me, not a bit, it is pressed against it, the most uncomfortable airplane. No water or anything is provided on the flight, if it is 1 2 or 3 hours, you do not even get 1 sip of water. The air hostess do absolutely nothing the entire flight, they sit around on their phones.

Yes, we did have one of Lion Air's notorious delays (about 25 minutes) and no, they did not mention it nor apologize. However, the flight itself was allright. Seats and legroom are comparable to other low-cost airlines and we comfortable enough for me (I'm just under 1.80 m). Staff are friendly and in-flight food and drinks are inexpensive.

Flown with about almost 1.5 hours of delay for the return leg but it is Changi so I won't complain. What I notice about this airline is that they provide more (just a little more) room for International flights. Had no problem fitting in my legs (I am 184cm tall) a little cramped but nothing compared to my last CGK-DPS-CGK flight. That being mentioned I can't actually say much about the level of comfort that I get from LCCs you get what you pay! Now lowering down my standard to the level of LCCs Lion Air is a pleasant airline to fly with. What they can do to improve passenger satisfaction is to improve their punctuality.

It started 3 days before trying to re-confirm my flight with them as it has been booked 9 months earlier from the UK and I had an email advising slight schedule change the day earlier. We arrive at Bali airport to be met with chaos at check in most disorganised airline ever (and I have travelled many times in the Far East and Africa). It took about an hour to get to the front of the queue when we did the girl checking us in seemed to be having a few problems with the booking but eventually checked us in and took our baggage and issued our boarding passes. We arrive at the gate at the required time to be met again by chaos it appeared all Lion Air and Wings Air flights go from this gate I confirmed with desk clerk we were at the right gate and we sat down and waited the boarding time arrived and past I went back to the desk as we approached the departure time to again be told right gate please wait! The departure time now had passed and it was about an hour past departure time a few flights had been boarded but no news of ours none of the departure boards were working so again I went up for a third time to find out what was happening asked another person to be advised 'Flight Cancelled' and you have to go back to check in. I got the clerk to assist us back to the airline desk and we found out the flight had actually been cancelled the night before they never should have checked us in and took our luggage. The airline were not able to rebook us either on to another flight so we lost our trip to Komodo.

It wasn't a bad experience but wasn't the best either.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
lion-air,258472,2011-01-14,2,Singapore,,Lion Air customer review,SIN-CGK on new B737-900. Booking was good website efficient and easy. Flight was delayed for about 45 minutes without any notice. During take off and landing there is one passenger who never set his seat upright and FAs don't bother to remind him. Seat pitch very poor. Baggage claim at CGK is a havoc. Baggage carousel is changed without any notice and a very long time to have your baggage on the belt.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,no
lion-air,258473,2010-11-22,,Indonesia,,Lion Air customer review,Flight Jakarta to Bali was 2 hours delayed. Return flight 3 hours delayed. I tried to call their service center several times but no one answers the phone. No notification of delays until you get to the airport. Time is extremely important when traveling. It is obvious that despite their reasonably low fares they don't care for their customers. I will never fly this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
lion-air,258474,2010-07-02,4,Australia,,Lion Air customer review,Jakarta-Jogya wasn't a pleasant experience. Plane 1hour late - no info/announcements. Departure lounge overflowing with passengers from 3 late Lion flights. Plane (B737) dirty and shabby with indifferent cabin crew (no checks to see bags properly stowed seats upright for landing/take off etc). Website is good but this doesn't make up for other problems.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,no
lion-air,258475,2010-05-08,7,,,Lion Air customer review,"First pro is their web site very easy and no hidden costs the spring up as you progress into the booking process. Aircraft mostly new and clean with friendly staff. Flight service is limited seat pitch 28"" for coach and 32 for business. Very tight however was on request was given a long leg seat with a smile and no charge.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
lion-air,258476,2009-08-09,,Indonesia,,Lion Air customer review,CGK - Lombok DPS - CGK on new 737-900. Using the domestic terminal in Jakarta it was pretty hectic. One thing that bothered me the crew did not check the name on the boarding pass with our ID. The flight to Lombok was delayed for an hour while we were onboard. Seats and service were decent since we were using the old plane. Getting back from Bali to Jakarta was terrible. Using the new B737-900 the seats was seriously tight - have never flown any plane with seats that uncomfortable.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
lion-air,258477,2009-03-15,1,,,Lion Air customer review,"CGK-DEN-CGK. CGK-DEN delayed by 2 hours to 11am due to technical problems so Lion Air gave a lunch box - not bad but not appetizing. I went to the Manager on Duty to ask for an earlier flight on another airline (as I was planning to return the same day) but they couldn't find a seat on another airline. When I reminded her that Garuda had a flight leaving soon she said she didn't check with Garuda. They were definitely overwhelmed with complaints. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I've ever been on. I'm only 171cm (5'7"") but my knees touched the seat in front of me. No service onboard not even a glass of water or anybody going around the cabin selling anything. If they dont improve the service I wont use them anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258478,2009-03-13,2,,,Lion Air customer review,DPS-CGK new B737-900. The aircraft condition although it is brand new but dirty many spots on the leather seat trash on the carpet which shows that they do not clean it properly. FA only did the safety demonstration do the snack & drinks selling and the rest of the flight they chit chat on the pantry. Some of the FA announcement are recorded. Another things some passengers are still doing some activity while the fasten seat belt sign is on and the FA did not warn the passenger to go back to their seat. I believe that Lion Air should upgrade their services and FA skills/knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258479,2008-12-01,4,,,Lion Air customer review,CGK to KUL return. Didn't expect much as had poor experiences with Lion in the past but was pleasantly surprised. Check-in very orderly both flights arrived absolutely on time and the fare was very competitive indeed. No food or IFE. Everything else was no-frills - but seats are allocated and flight operates to the proper passenger terminal at KUL and not the awful LCCT so I'd say that Lion has the edge over the other low-cost operator on this route Air Asia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258480,2008-11-21,3,,,Lion Air customer review,"SIN - CGK one way flight on time with new B737-900ER. Seat pitch was very tight (around 28"") - very hard to sit and move around. The 1.5hr journey was like a shuttle bus - no services and you cannot even purchase any foods or drinks. FAs were attentive as call button answered immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258481,2008-10-23,4,,,Lion Air customer review,SIN-DPS-SIN both flights using the new B737-900ER. Cabin clean bright and airy. I was impressed that food (hot meal dessert and salad - all served on a tray) + drinks were served for both flights. Pity that load factor for both legs was less than 40% and no inflight entertainment was offered at all. It's a great flying experience overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258482,2008-08-26,4,,,Lion Air customer review,Singapore-Bali on new 737-900. Low fare with Good Service. Seat a bit hard Food provided is enough but not nice. Return Flight delay about 50 min. Overall still satisfied with Lion Air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258483,2008-08-11,3,,,Lion Air customer review,JOG - CGK. I guess this airline is fair. Our flight was cancelled and the flight we were put onto was about 3 hours late (it was due to leave about 2 hours before our flight). But they were very efficient in transferring us onto another flight. They even got everybody a donut and water. So full credit to the Jogjakarta customer services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258484,2008-07-14,5,,,Lion Air customer review,DPS-CGK-DPS. Both legs using new Boeing 737-900 ER. Departed on-time even early. Cabin was clean. No more free drink. All foods and drinks are for purchase. Seat pitch quite tight. Overall I was satisfied flying on Lion Air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
lion-air,258485,2008-06-19,,,,Lion Air customer review,SIN-DPS-SIN on 737-900ER. Latest entrant on the 'prized' route and had to take advantage of low fares not available for past two years. Single class cabin seats rather hard but typical of such carriers slight recline snack box and free drinks provided. Returning flight at 12am was delayed for 2 hours ground staff provided mini dinner snack box which most passengers left untouched. Delay was informed upon check in. Cabin crew pleasant call button answered almost immediately drinks requests tended to quickly. The major difference between Lion and the rest of the budget carriers is that they do not hawk duty free sales so once meal service is completed passengers are left undisturbed. Both flights not completely full despite the very attractive fares. One reason could be due to the bad publicity Indonesian carriers have been receiving. Extremely value-for-money service something we should not take for granted in these times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
