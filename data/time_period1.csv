2019,"Our trip to Athens this month certainly met our expectations. Scoot is a budget airline though you wouldn't know it from the attentive ground crew and the cabin crew we had on our flights from Perth to Athens. The best way to enjoy such a long flight (11.5 hours) is what we did by paying that bit extra and having extra leg room seat or/ exit row. It's totally worth it as there is no reclining seat in front of you and the access to get out of the seat makes the journey so much more comfortable. The only negative was the very worn carpet, unusual as it was a fairly new Boeing 787. The plane left on time in both Perth/Singapore and Athens. We will definitely travel Scoot again.",0
2019,"Singapore to Sydney. For the most part, this airline does what they say on the box. It's a budget airline so you know you'll get the bare minimum unless you pay more which is fine. I was really disappointed with the meal service, I prebooked a ""meal, drink and snack"". They gave me no choice of drink and would only give me a 350ml bottle of water which I think is really misleading.  The meal was served almost immediately after departure for an 8 hour flight and I was told I couldn't  have it later. The flight left at about 0715 and my meal was a lunch/dinner option yet they served it as breakfast anyway. Refusing to give me an option honestly made it seem like they were rushing them out ASAP to get it out of the way since they already had my money, choosing to not care about what the customer wants, and hoping the unnecessarily early meal would lead to me needing a second meal later in the flight. I fly scoot semi-regularly and will never pre-book a meal again as a result. If it's any cheaper to pre-book it's only by about $1-2, so definitely not worth being misled about the drink and then force-fed the second you get on the plane. The stinginess with drinks doesn't even go away in their business class cabin which I've flown a couple of times in the past. They say you get a complimentary alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink, but upon asking for something like a whiskey and coke, you get told that whiskey is one free complimentary drink, so if you want coke it's a second drink you have to pay for! The only other issue I encountered was with the automatic check-in, where it refused to take my bag several times despite it being well within all the relevant limits. However, even with that delay, it was much quicker than with many other airlines so I can't really complain. I can't really fault the airline otherwise, they do pretty good deals and the seats aren't too bad. There's no inflight entertainment but in this day and age, I'd rather download something on my phone. Just ensure you have plenty of power as you'll be charged if you want to use the USB charger in your seat. I wouldn't recommend Scoot for a long journey like Australia to Europe, but for flights up to around 8 hours they're fine, just don't expect much other than a seat and a safe journey.",0
2019,"Coimbatore to Singapore. Friendly Check-in staffs (the only positive) in Singapore and in Coimbatore.  Most unfriendly crew i have met. Our group had traveled with 2 children one 1 year and 10 months and the other 2 years and 25 days old. Since my daughter was over 2 years she was given a separate seat and charged fully (acceptable as she has exceeded the age of the infant) Then during the take off they wanted her to sit separately in her seat and wear a seat belt. The kid had slept sitting on her moms lap as the flight's take off time was only by 12 20 am. The air hostess took her forcefully and put her on the other seat and it was a rough time after that. Then the hostess said sorry and accepted to let her sit with the mother. The same thing happened on our way back from Singapore. The steward tried to put my daughter in the separate seat and she wouldn't sit. there was an announcement from the pilot that the flight will be taken back to the gate if the child doesn't sit in the seat. Luckily she slept for a while and we could lean her onto her seat and managed to put the seat belt over her. During landing the crew (4 of them) came stood around us and made sure they woke my daughter up, made her cry and they tried to forcefully make her sit on her seat. I lost it and asked all of them to move away and i was going to complain against all of them when we landed and did so. Other airlines even though they give a separate seat considering the age (2 years) they accept the baby to sit with the parent and give a extended seat belt. But no empathy here. They introduced Scoot as a budget airline. But it is no way cheaper compared to SilkAir. Travel with Silkair was so pleasant.  But Fly scoot such a joke. S$3 for water, S$15 for blanket etc etc. Even the cost is not an issue but the way they treated us was terrible. Sorry this will be my last ever travel with Fly scoot. Wouldn't recommend it to any one.",1
2019,"Singapore to Jakarta. There's no space to put my laptop bag on the top, because already full with cabin luggage. Stewardess also doesnt want try to find out the space. So I should put my laptop bag, my wallet bag under chair, my feet doesnt have space & not comfortable for trip 2 hours. It should be that luggage move to other space and this responsibilities cabin crew to find out.not sacrifice other passenger which pay the same price but got different service. Disappointed with their service.",1
2019,"Wuhan to Singapore. I am very disappointed that since Silkair gave up this route to Scoot, the timing of the flight is terrible and that the price is even more expansive then Silkair, considering Scoot is a budget airline. I wish they could reinstate back to Silkair or at least, use the same flight time slot. Otherwise, I am giving up flying Scoot.",1
2019,"Ok this short one hour hop from Penang to Singapore, I chose Scoot. Scoot is a low cost airline. I had the emergency row seat which offered good leg space. There is no personal entertainment system on board. Drinks and snacks are for purchase and I pre-ordered a snack pack comprising a bottle of mineral water, pop corn and chocolates for RM45. I did not have any expectations from a low cost airline so it serves its purpose by getting me to my destination at a low price.",0
2019,Cebu to Singapore. All went smoothly at check in. On entering plane I mentioned it was my friends birthday. The cabin crew could not have been more friendly or helpful. I had hoped for a quick mention but they organised a game which resulted in all passengers singing happy birthday. They were wonderful.,0
2019,"Singapore to Perth. Pay the extra $100 and fly with another airline. It's not worth the cheap fares at all! I was misinformed by their customer representative on my baggage allowance and then charged an absurd amount of $400 at the airport to check my bag all due to their misinformation! No one gets back to me when I call the hotline or send an email requesting a refund. Honestly, just save yourself the frustration and pay a little extra so you don't have to deal with the mess that is this airline.",1
2019,"Singapore to Guangzhou with Scoot. Awful airline, pre-purchased front seat, while check in and boarding, have been reallocate to very rear seat without being informed. Feedback to customer service, their standard reply was that there was an aircraft change. I am 100% sure there was no aircraft change, since boarding ticket and booking detail were the same in flight no. and plane type. Even more terrible is they only refund after you have lodged a complaint, and was just refunded a voucher!",1
2019,"Singapore to Sydney. Terrible, avoid at all costs TR2 route, the plane had issues had to exit the plane and reboard another. I'd rather poke my eyes out than fly Scoot ever again. Zero communication from crew. I'd rate this company zero out of ten, but it won't allow it so 1 star it is. Avoid at all costs.",1
2019,"Penang to Singapore. Seats are slightly better compared to AiraAsia. However, priority privilege such as board me first was not given after purchasing. Flight experience was acceptable for low cost carrier flights.",0
2019,"Singapore to Nanjing. Scoot is a decent airline when they're on time, but the problem is that they often aren't, or force you to accept changes in their schedule at their mercy. Scoot offer a wide variety of destinations at a very competitive price point using very new aircraft, but the biggest problem with them is that they change their schedule often.",1
2019,Our flight TR 465 from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore scheduled to depart on 25 Oct 2019 at 10.20pm was delayed to 11.30pm and then delayed to 12.10am - now they just announced will depart at 1.10am.  Do they have any concerns on passengers inconvenience.,1
2019,I was notified early in the morning that my return flight from Bangkok to Singapore had been rescheduled from 1700 to 1925. Since there were no updates during the day I made my way to the airport arriving with ample time to spare at 1630. I was shocked to be told at check-in that the flight was further delayed to 2235. Now I have no choice but to waste 6 hours with nothing more than a spurious apology from the ground staff who appeared just as blur as the frustrated passengers. My simple question to the airline why were there no updates after 0530 ..  is it not common courtesy and indeed normal procedure to keep passengers informed so that even if they cannot do anything about the delay at least they don't have to have salt rubbed in by having to waste time waiting in a crowded and noisy substandard airport? Treating passengers like rubbish.,1
2019,"We traveled as a family of 4 from Taroko to Taipei for return flight to Singapore on Tue 19th Oct 2019. Due to the length of the journey and the numbers of transits we had to make, we were unfortunately slightly late at check in - just before 3pm, 5min late to be precise. The ground staff refused to let us check in and offered no help and advice on the return options. The male staff who claimed to be the supervisor in charge has the worse possible service attitude - he was aggressive and unpleasant. He is the worst service staff I have come across in a very long time. Its not clear whether he is an employee of Scoot or belongs to a contracting company. In either case he should be replaced because he is a very negative representation of Scoot in Taiwan.",1
2019,"Taipei to Singapore. A terrible experience with Scoot. Firstly, it not available to online check in Taiwan, yet there is no warning given at the purchase. My flight was at 23:40, I arrived at 22:15, the check-in counter was already closed. There was still 1hr 15 min away from the flight off. There was no way for me to contact Scoot Taiwan nor I can purchase the next flight at the counter. It was the worst experience ever!",1
2019,"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. I realize this is a budget airline so my level of expectation was already quite low. Ive been flying with them every week for work and the staff, particularly the ones at the ground are one of the worst Ive seen. Has no organized policy or set manuals- will charge you extra fees randomly or make your life miserable based on how they feel that day.  If you complain, they will not apologize nor will they at least try to look into your issue. All youll get is an attitude or even worse they may make your life more miserable.",1
2019,"Trichy to Singapore. The flight was delayed 1/2 an hour. The seats were cramped. The food was expensive. The crew was nice, but not motivated. Seats were ok, but not too comfy. But it was worth the price.",0
2019,"So so so bad. Scoot has rescheduled my flight, not once, not twice, not three times but 4 times! I had to skip a meeting and leave one day earlier to make it on time in Singapore. I must have called the customer service 4 times because of the problems they put me through and when I asked for compensation they just told me the usual ""you have 3 solutions concerning a rescheduled flight"". Didn't even offer an additional suitcase or an upgrade. Just to make it clear, Scoot will provide you with 4 different flights for one day, but will cancel it if is not full and just reschedule your ticket, until there is only one flight a day. Just an advice if you are traveling with Scoot, have your entire day available for them because they will treat their customers as if the only thing they had to do was take their flight. Scheduling is apparently not important. Will never ever ever book with this company again. Not trustworthy at all.",1
2019,"Singapore to Melbourne. Scoot rescheduled my original flights in October 2019 to an entire day later for Both my outbound and inbound flights. This was totally unsuitable for me so I tried to find a different flight that flew on the same days but there were no longer any Scoot flights. Alternative options would be on different airlines. As I had made my booking through a travel agent, nothing was offered to me, even though I paid the same amount than I would direct. Not even to accommodate me on a partner airline (something I believe would have been offered IF i'd booked direct) and I'm left to bear the cost of something that was entirely on the blame of the airlines. Call Support center staff were not helpful at all and kept directing us to email in (from previous experiences, this never gets responded to on time and help is minimal). I think their customer service is really horrendous and they provide nothing of value when customers are in urgent need. Even as a budget carrier, the very least you could do is train your customer service officers so they know what to do and not shifting the blame elsewhere.",1
2019,"We booked two flights with Scoot - one from Berlin to Singapore, one from Singapore to Melbourne. A lot of things have been missing. We already knew that they wont offer us any food for free, but we expected something to drink, at least water. Nothing was given to us on either flight. The staff was unfriendly. It was impossible to close the blinds, so there was light constantly. There was no opportunity to charge your phone for free (only for 5$) and no TVs. If you order a meal for 13, you only get one dish (very small), a bottle of water or a coke and one dessert, e.g. a friend got a 15g pack of crisps, we got a Ritter Sport chocolate. I can accept all of these things for a cheaper price, but I expect to get at least some water. On our second flight, they promised we could fill up our water bottles in between the security check and before going into the plane, but then they said its too late and weve been in there with nothing. So if you come prepared, you can choose Scoot, but I wouldnt recommend it.",1
2019,"The flight I took from Bangkok to Tokyo was a second half from Singapore to Tokyo Narita via Bangkok Don Muang. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised. The aircraft was new and the the cabin was clean. The seat was fairly comfortable but the legroom is average. Luckily, the flight was fairly empty so I got my whole row for myself for sleep (this was an overnight flight). The seat contained magazines, safety card but no air sickness bag. The price of the food and anything else was expensive. The cabin crew were friendly but not motivated. The flight departed and arrived on time. The toilet was clean but very small. Nothing really special in this flight as this is a red-eye flight. Overall, this flight was average and pleasant flight.",1
2019,"Sydney to Singapore. I found Scoot to be better than some other economy airlines. Check in was quick and easy, the flight was on time, staff and cabin crew courteous and friendly, and prices for on board menus we're fine. A great experience and I will definitely travel Scoot again.",0
2019,"Singapore to Surabaya. Flight departed and arrived about 45 minutes late. No Indonesian customs forms were provided to passengers, which is unusual. Other than these, it was a usual budget flight with no free food and jaded crew.",0
2019,"Gold Coast to Singapore. Was due to be traveling to Singapore for just 1 day. Taking my wifes parents out of the country to comply with immigration laws and then returning to Australia. Everything seemed normal, we booked online and entered all  information including passport details and expiry. Arrived at the airport and Scoot said I could not travel due to my passport only has 5 months before it expires. Why did they not tell me this when I entered my passport details onto their website when booking? I could have organised another one in time as we had months from the time we booked the tickets. They told me it is common knowledge and I should have known this and that is is in their contracts. So we lost 3 return tickets and accommodation totaling $3,824.They could and should have their web developers enter a simple script that alerts anyone to this fact when entering their passport expiry date. I do not recommend Scoot.",1
2019,Ipoh to Singapore. First time in Malaysia and not sure what expect. At the airport ground staff were very friendly and helpful. On the aircraft again friendly and helpful. If I visit Asia again and need to use an airline then I would certainly consider Scoot,0
2019,"Jakarta to Berlin via Singapore. On the website it says that it includes a large suitcase (in general) and then that in economic it includes two handbags (I think I remember well). In addition it puts several options of weight: 1 without weight, 2 20 kg (don't remember ), 3 25 kg (don't remember ), etc. Which let me to think that if I carried 15 kg of checked luggage I didn't have to pay, and in fact, I had finally to pay 100.  This comment may not show what I try to explain, but if you see it on the website it will be understood. In addition, paying food were shown on the website, and I also thought it would be an extra, because of course, paying your 12h flight ticket, how could it be so they do not give you a minimum of food and drink?",1
2019,Singapore to Guangzhou. My first Scoot flight. Not bad to be honest. I had a meal and suitcase included in my ticket. Food did not look great but was hot and very tasty. Cabin crew attentive and friendly. New clean aircraft. Seats not too comfortable but leg room surprisingly good. No IFE for this low cost carrier. For a short haul flight of under 4 hours Scoot was acceptable. It is not like its big sister and there is a difference but if price is your bottom line then Scoot may be just the ticket!,0
2019,"Phuket to Singapore. Dont take scoot often, But always feel the cabin crew are the best. Its common that passengers carry heavy luggage on board, although its cabin size, but heavier than the allowable weight of 7kg. No matter how full the flight and how full the overhead compartment, they will try to help passengers to put the luggage into the compartment. Suggest all the ground check in counter to check passengers hand carry and weight, when necessary, force them to check in the overweight Luggage.",0
2019,"Berlin to Ho Chi Minh City via Singapore. Terrible experience. Low-cost airline, but unreliable one. I booked and paid for my all luggage (45kg). Then, when I checked in, the system didn't show my payment for the luggage. I only could send 25kg, the rest I had to handle by myself and keep in Germany and deliver by other means. There was no one from Scoot in Berlin Tegel airport, the check-in staff were from the airport - not from the airline, so they said they couldn't handle that. I showed all documents to them, but they still didn't accept because the system didn't show. I tried bunch of times to call and contact someone from Scoot, but the phone calls were failed (they showed on the website that they serve 24/7, I called at 7am to 7h30 am, I just had only 2 hours before my departure, no one picked the phone). Scoot was so bad in customer service. The first time with Scoot is the last time, in my case. Now, one of my luggage is still in Germany and I have to pay again for other delivery, so terrible.",1
2019,"Bad policies, needlessly restrictive. Arrived at SGN from elsewhere in Vietnam and not allowed to check in for my connecting flight to Singapore because I was too early. (This wouldnt be an issue elsewhere in the world, as transfers would happen within a single terminal). So, rather than being able to pass the time enjoyably in the Orchid Lounge inside the terminal, which I have access to, I had to wait for 1.5 hours outside the airport or in the crowded departures hall. Garbage. They have also even further restricted carry-on baggage limits recently. Not serving passengers a glass of water without charge should be illegal. No inflight entertainment to speak of. Ive flown plenty of low cost carriers (Ryanair, AirAsia, Jetstar, etc), Scoot lands at the bottom of the pile.",1
2019,"Denpasar to Berlin via Singapore. The worst customer service. I had purchased a roundtrip ticket to Berlin. Later when I noticed that the return flight was not matching with my connecting flight from Nice, I tried to make a change for the next day. When I saw that the change, all of a sudden had a 11 hour layover in Singapore, (unlike the original flight) I called customer service to cancel the return flight all together and purchase my return flight from a different airline. Yet I was still in the ""system"" . So when I arrived at the airport they would not let me check in unless I paid another $300 for a hypothetical change on a flight which I canceled. Then I was told to call customer service, even though I had been on the phone with them already for two days and they were unable to take the charge out of the 'system"". Truly outrageous. Do not use this airline.",1
2019,"Brisbane to Athens via Singapore. Inexperience flight crew from Singapore to Athens, poor customer service. We experienced several huge turbulence, the worst turbulence I've had. The pilot kept telling us to sit properly and buckle up without further explanation. I traveled with my cousin but we can't check in online so we arrived at the counter before check in open and specifically asked to have seats together, the staff was assure that we'll be seated together but it turned out to be the seats were separated! After I asked to get a fragile sticker to be stick on my luggage, my cousin then asked for one on hers, the staff rolled her eyes in front of us showing her annoyance.  Overall, very disappointed first experience with Scoot and will never fly with them again.",1
2019,"Singapore to Kalibo. I will accept bad services, minimal attention, no inflight entertainment and costly additional surcharges. I cannot accept that Scoot cancelled my flight without notification and keeps sending me reminders to check in.  We arrived at the airport, 6 months after planning our 4-day vacation for my friends bachelorette party. There we were told something none of us could have anticipated: Scoot stopped flying to Kalibo or Caticlan long ago. What are we supposed to do then? Why did we received multiple emails leading to the actual day calling us to pack our bags and complete online check in. FYI I was unable to checkin online but didnt thought of it as weird. Those were not the first questions Scoot ground staff or even the call center thought of. Their first question to address: Its not our fault you didnt receive the emails we sent! Let us dig for proof. So it became a contest of proof vs proof. Meaningless and waste of our time. In that time we could have booked a flight to Manila and reach Kalibo by the evening. No, Scoot and their ground staff would like to play a game of lets ignore them till they go away. We were blatantly shunned and no one would attend to us for about one hour while the most responsible person there was busy solving other problems. Even worse, all of the ground staff totally disassociated themselves from Scoot, even as they wear Scoot badges and T-shirts. They told me they cannot make decisions or do anything because they dont work for Scoot - how blatantly they declared that. I wonder if Scoot cares about Customer Service. I really am disgusted by the poor systems, customer service and resource allocation by Scoot. Please avoid using this airline if you can. I cannot advise you how to avoid the same situation I got into. I hope you have better luck if you must fly with them.",1
2019,"I cancelled my flights in advance for medical reasons. I had different flights booked with Cebu Pacific and Scoot. After sending emails, hours of calls over the phone, i received one of the refund but the other one after calling again the company and sending emails, never got any response. My flight was Manila to Gold Coast via Singapore. The first one was suppose to be done and then transfer. After calling Cebu, they told me i need to coordinate first with the other company because they are also involve with the transfer. I then called the other company and they told me exactly the same. I need to call to coordinate the refund. 2 months waiting. Never got any answers to my emails after 2 months Even after several follows-ups. I called again in august to know where is my money I insisted to talk to the manager and lady told me they will call me back within 24 hours. They confirmed my phone number and extension +32 for Belgium. So was waiting, waiting and waiting and no one called back. So i called back and again the same. Thats the worst customer service i ever seen.",1
2019,"Sydney to Singapore. I've traveled with Scoot many times and I understand this is a budget airline and there are many things that are not great about their services even as a budget airline. but the worst thing, in my opinion, about this airline is that because its a cheap options, they feel justified to mistreat people. I was unable to do check in online, and I have no idea why because no information is provided. I show up to the airport, there is a huge line because there are only 2 counters open, and there are 3 staffs there doing nothing just watching their phone. I tried to approached them asking if we have to wait in such a long quote even if we dont have any luggage with us (I actually waited for 2-3 mins with a big distance behind the counter until one of the attendants made eye contact and then asked the questions). She was really not trying to be helpful and wanted to get rid of me saying its my fault I didnt check in online. But I tried and couldnt, Can you explain why?, with a really bad tone she said I dont know what is the issue with your device, lots of other people could!! So I just said youre not being helpful but thanks and walked away while I heard her saying and youre rude and shouldnt be helped! Excuse me?? The whole time I didnt changed my tone, I didnt ask for something unreasonable or said anything rude to you. just asking if people without luggage should also wait in line and trying to understand why we couldnt check online. Scoot staff think because its a budget airline, they can treat people however they want and they are not held accountable to anything. And thats just despicable.",1
2019,"I travelled from Singapore to Hyderabad on August 1st. I left my bag on aeroplane, hen i informed to the staff through their customer service they didn't even pay a minimum attention and did not consider the issue. The staff was very reluctant about the issue",1
2019,"Athens to Melbourne via Singapore. Worst experience I have had flying. I had an 11 hour flight and I wasnt feeling very well, I did not have any cash on me but I did have a visa debit. When the flight attendants where serving refreshments I needed a water but they would not accept my card, I told them I wasnt feeling well and asked for some water and they would not give me any so I had to keep going toilet so I could drink from the tap in there. On top of that my seat would not go back so I had to sit upright the entire flight. I think if the flight is over a certain time for example 3 hours, it should be mandatory to give customers a water/drink at the very least. Very poor service and I will never, ever even consider flying with them again.",1
2019,"Sydney to Singapore. Scoot are fine for a budget no-frills airline. The seats and leg-room are OK as are the planes. But whatever you do, do not prepay for any ""extras"", as it's a lottery if you end up getting them or not. I prepaid for numerous extras on a recent trip to Singapore (meals, seat selection) and only got about half of them, resulting in stand-and(& the food was lousy!). It appears their cost-cutting extends to their general administration.",0
2019,"Scoot is another budget airline which operates from Singapore, and is a competitor of Jetstar Asia. It's affiliated with Singapore Airlines. It pays to pay for board me first, which givers you priority check in to beat the long queue, as well as being amongst the first to board first, so that you may secure overhead locker's space. Service is great, in many ways no different to some regular airlines. The meals however, is an area which they don't really shine. It's ok, just that it cannot compare with Jetstar Asia, which excels in this area. Other than that, everything is just the same, get you from A to B at a reasonable price (but do shop around first). At both SIN and HKG airports, aero bridge is used, which adds value to the flight experience.",0
2019,"As much as I like and enjoyed travelling with Scoot, this is my worst encounter with their  call centre. Ive been issued with 2 vouchers due to the refund of the seats that I purchased for the past flights. Firstly, I do not have the option to choose refund of cash or refund back to my credit card. Secondly, if I proceed to redeem the vouchers, I have to pay the balance with a credit card, incurring a processing fee of $40, when I can have a choice to pay the balance via PayNow or through AXS machine, having to pay a much lesser processing fee of $4/$6. This is ridiculous!! I called the call centre and all they can do is to apologise for the inconvenience but they cant solve this issue that I am facing. Call centres are suppose to help to solve and reduce the problems that passengers are facing but Im appalled that sorry is the only solution that Scoot can provide. Very disappointed passenger.",1
2019,"Sydney to Berlin via Singapore. They denied me to fly and would not make any concession to rebook me, losing me not only their cheap flight but all the connecting travel. I have traveled twice to Europe in the last 16 months using my passport that was water damaged on a hike in New Zealand two years ago. No immigration offices in New Zealand Germany England Italy Sweden And Australia have flagged it and the officious duty manager would not let us check it with the anyone in immigration. I understand the airline can get in trouble if they let a damaged passport get through. But on return to Canberra where I thought I would have to apply for a passport from scratch because it was so damaged, it was fine for just a renewal. We were not the only people having problems we watched a family brought to tears by one of the other booking agents. No food, no water, no service, no power,no Tv, no blankets,no pillow, no baggage, no care. No flight for me.",1
2019,"I booked my flight to Kuching from Singapore and this is not the first time Ive flown with scoot. Dont expect good service. We arrived at least 3 hrs early, asked if we could be moved to the front a little bit and got a front seat. Everything went well until theyve decided to take that back and moved us 20 seats to the back with a condescending tone in front of all of the customers shouting whether weve paid for the front seat or not. So regardless whether Ive purchased this seat or not, Ive still paid for my ticket.",1
2019,"I booked a ticket Bangkok to Singapore return at the same time from the Scoot website. As I normally do I checked the spelling of my name and the dates to make sure I hadn't made any mistakes and then paid by Visa. I checked to see which airport it flew from as there are 2 airports in Bangkok, most low cost airlines fly from Don Meauang Airport but some are located at Suvarnabhumi. I noted that this flight took for from Suvarnabhumi Airport. What I didn't check was the airline that the return flight landed in. This turned out to be Don Meauang. Yes, this was shown on the itinerary but I think it's a bit misleading. I never expected it to be a different airport and from reading complaints online a lot of people are thinking the same as me. I ended up having to pay for a taxi at Midnight on the return date to get to my car (40 minutes away). When I called Scoot to complain they were polite but said that it's my responsibility to know which airline the flight arrives at. Needless to say I'm not pleased by that type of response and Scoot will now be my last choice for air travel. They can't be trusted.",1
2019,"Kansai to Singapore on 2nd July. If you like a great dose of uncertainty before you fly, then Scoot is the perfect airline for you! For a 19.35 flight, we found out our flight is delayed 1hr 40 mins!  Before the gates open, we get another surprise delay again!",1
2019,"I have taken Scoot multiple times not because they are fantastic but due to the affordable cost. The staff were generally grumpy and unpleasant on both flights inbound and on the return. To sum it up: Scoot is the equivalent of Ryanair in Asia. I napped most of the outbound flight and did not eat or drink. My seat did not recline. I was hungry on the return flight and the staff got angry when my contactless card was declined, and prodded me to hurry up as I went through my carry on backpack to fish out my wallet for change- only to fall short by 10 cents and I had to pay in USD. I apologised and the attendant muttered something under her breath, dropped my items down on the table even as I said thank you, she walked away in a huff. Terrible customer service. The crew only cleared trash 30 minutes prior to landing so I was forced to sit with my box of pot noodles and soiled napkins for a good 90 minutes after eating. In addition, the staff kept barking out orders on the PA saying no outside food is allowed. Are we children in elementary school? Ugh. Overall, terrible service.",1
2019,"Singapore to Jakarta. Plane left and arrived on time. The bare-bones facilities were not much of an issue on this short flight, so unlike on long-haul, Scoot was fine for this journey.",0
2019,"Plane both left Berlin and arrived at Singapore over an hour late. As bare-bones a budget flight as they come. Seats thin, stiff and uncomfortable. No debit cards accepted on board so couldn't purchase anything. Not even shared monitors to show the plane's progress on such a long-distance flight. Even to watch the paid entertainment program you must download an app and watch them on your own cell phone or other device. The only positives: ever-present polite Asian crew and generous free hand luggage allowance.",0
2019,"Melbourne to Denpasar via Singapore. This is a budget airline so you get what you expect. In saying this, all flights were on time, departure was easy and carry on allowances are 10kg instead of the usual 7kg. Seats were ok, except no head rest, which you have to pay extra for. You also had to pay extra for food, water and any other beverages. Inflight entertainment was also at an additional cost as well as a blanket and pillow. You pay for a seat and that's literally all you get. Seats on the Dreamliner had better than average leg space however flights on the smaller A320 plane (DPS- SIN) were very tight. I would fly again for short haul flights, but i think for an 8 hr flight I need a blanket, meal and some sort of in flight entertainment included.",0
2019,"Singapore to Bali with Scoot. It was a horrible and uneventful flight. Flight was delayed for nearly three hours and all Scoot compensated us with was a packet of snacks and a bottle of water. Onboard the flight, the crew were generally okay. Seat was uncomfortable and very narrow. Legroom was also quite tight. Overall a bad flight with Scoot.",1
2019,"Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Apart from the not so nice service from the ground service, the flight was generally great. The cabin crew was generally cheerful and friendly but could be better.",0
2019,"Singapore to Athens. I initially planned for a connecting flight 2 with a layover duration of 2 hours. Scoot however, revised their schedule a couple of weeks before my flight, reducing my layover time by 20 minutes. On the flight day, we saw that the flight was re-timed. We went to the check in counter to entire, but the counter staff were not even aware that the flight was re-timed. They checked and advised us that the flight departure time will be delayed by 2 hours, but the arrival time will remain the same, which is ridiculous. We went through the customs and went straight to the gate. The gate did not even display the updated flight time. There was no communication to the passengers, all waiting in vain and frustrated. No customer service representative came to address the issue. We called up the call center, which was outsourced, and they too, have no idea that the flight was re-timed. We went to confirm with the lounge staff, who advised us there was in fact a delay of 2 hours, arrival time will be delayed by another 2 hours too. We understand that the delay was due to the earlier flight being delayed, because they were waiting for 8 passengers who were performing their transit. In other words, Scoot opted to delay a whole plane full of passengers, just to accommodate to the 8 people. Very poor decision making and management on Scoot's behalf. While we were on the plane but yet to depart, the plane was being delayed for another hour. We understand that this was due to accommodating to the request of a single passenger who decided to disembark and then changed his mind to reembark again. This decision, again, costed the whole plane full of passengers another hour, just for the sake of a single passenger. We were seeking updates from the stewardess during the delay, but she does not have any clue as to what is happening, and she had this irritating habit of touching her hair once every 10 seconds or so. I missed my connecting flight eventually, and had to book another connecting flight. I wrote in to Scoot for the compensation. Their customer support team is outsourced, and have no clue that the flight was delayed. They kept insisting that the flight delay was less than 3 hours, until I requested them to show me the actual departure time and actual arrival time, versus the scheduled departure and arrival time. They kept replying with copy-and-pasted templates which added to my frustration. They have this ""promise to you"" page on their website which says that they will compensate with a travel voucher for any delay more than 3 hours. It has been more than a month since I raised this claim and till now, it has not been resolved. The issue being transferred from one customer service officer to another. Not too sure if they even intend to deliver this promise that they state on their website. Comprehensive travel insurance does not cover delay of less than 6 hours, but their customer service officer kept asking me to check with the insurance company for compensation. Scoot is an irresponsible airline, with poor customer service. With so many of Scoot's recent delays in the news, now I understand, this is of no surprise. Do avoid at all costs.",1
2019,Manila to Phuket via Singapore. Hit with hundreds of dollars of overage fees on two carry-on bags we had to check because my friend and I booked our ticket in one reservation instead of separately. So 2 of us only get the checked bag allowance of one person (and the ticket costs the same as if we would have booked separately). This is not clearly explained when you book or confirm. Its a scam to get more money and they should be ashamed of themselves.,1
2019,"Manila to Singapore. I had pretty low expectations for this flight/airline after seeing many negative reviews after I already booked but it was a good no frills flight. The cabin staff that I was with were all professional, kind and efficient. Can't say enough good things about them. Honestly, I was kind of annoyed with the ground crew though. For the to SG flight, the ground crew were bordering talking down to the people trying the board (I get any group can be hard to deal with when not following instructions but you need to have some sort of control and courtesy). They called for first row, seniors, board me first. I was in the first row so I went yet the lady kept raising her voice and telling me later. I pointed out the seat number and told her to look at everyone tickets first. For the back to MNL flight, the ground crew just seemed inconsistent and rushed, eventually giving up on the section style bordering and just took everyone. It is what it is. As one can expect from a budget airline, there is no IFE and the food is not included. I found the menu very very pricey though even knowing their strategy. No problem with the seats since I got the stretch seats, I think it's worth it for big taller people(around $20-25) even for a short 3 hour flight. This is probably your best bet if your usual airline has no convenient flight for your next destination",0
2019,"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. To Scoot or not to Scoot In just one single trip I have come to the following conclusion about Scoot. There is inconsistency in the way they treat seat luggage allowance wise at different airports which cost us a lot. The web portal crashed multiple times when I tried to book luggage ... in the crash dump it said that they had ""been informed"" ... right. Maybe if the portal had worked I could have paid $105 return for luggage for my son as well instead of the total of $540. The air hostesses seems to look down on people, at least my wife who is kindness incarnated. The air hostesses seemed to have no information on extra seats and who is entitled to use them. The air hostesses apparently just assumed that we were getting off in Singapore .... the way they handled the stroller part in the story border lines theft of $400 in my books. It was only that I broke a massive sweat to ""pull it from the dumpster"" that I got my property back. The people in service phone has no clue about prices of luggage, again it seems this case falls out of their flow chart. The customer support does not respond, responds consistently only after the 10 days probably to wear you down and will apparently try and make you give up by death by paragraphs ... but I can read and this has become a matter of principle for me. The main issue was the the fact that we got trapped on the return to Gold Coast with luggage conditions that were suddenly different in Bangkok than in Gold Coast. This cost us A$300 extra  but even though thats a lot of money, there is a certain amount of unfairness to it which is why I am making my voice heard. I have written to Scoot regarding the excess luggage and waited the 10 days without a reply from them. Then I wrote again and have waited another 10 days without hearing anything. But then I heard from them with the following message: ""Our record shows that you have purchased an extra seat for your infant, however, infants are not considered as a full paying passenger. You may refer to our Conditions of Carriage 3.3 regarding infant passenger."" In fact under baggage allowance it says ""Infants not occupying a seat have no Checked Baggage allowance"" which must mean that our son, since he occupied a seat either had a checked baggage allowance or at least was allowed to have one. So, they seem they will do anything to deflect. I have written to them with this argument. And they replied back that they have considered it and that infants occupying a seat still cannot have Checked Baggage allowance.",1

A few days ago advised flight from Perth to Singapore was cancelled and put on another flight (SQ) a day early on 30 May. Looked online to view available flights on the 31st and there was another SQ flight on the 31st May with similar departure time to my original Scoot flight. They did not allow me to change flight as it they do not have authority over SQ flights (same organization that moved me from Scoot to SQ in the first place), forcing me to stay longer in Singapore.",1

2019,"Scoot HNL-KIX r/t. Our tickets were only about $300/person, including 1 checked bag and 1 meal in each direction. For this price we did not expect much but we were positively surprised. The plane was clean and spacious, it even had mood lighting. The seats were not overly comfortable but ok even for a 9 hr flight. Leg room was sufficient. The crew was very friendly and approachable so no complaints about the service. There was a 1 hr delay on the HNL-KIX segment but we were kept informed at the gate; the return flight was on time. The only complaint are the high food and drink prices - about US $3 for a small bottle of water and the pre-ordered meal would have been cheaper if bought on board (the on-board menu listed a price of Sin $18 and I paid US $18 during booking). I would fly them again although the next time I would eat before the flight and bring more snacks on board (snacks are supposedly allowed and we had no problems nibbling on our chocolate and nuts that we brought with us). Overall, I would recommend this airline. For the price we paid it was great value.",0
2019,"Singapore to Ipoh. This flight was like taking an express bus coach. I've given Scoot a poor review flying 10 hrs from a non home country origin. This time the experience was completely different. Arriving at Changi airport and immediately greeted by a well dressed lady who offered to help me check in. What! Help me check in to Scoot? I declined as I knew what I was doing, so I went to the Scoot area and there were 4 counters open and nobody in the queue. Immediately checked in with no hassle, very helpful lady. Looks like I bought my ""board me first"" for nothing. At the gate, everything was squeaky clean. Boarding was by row and not by ""board me first"". Still, no problem. Very friendly crew, and departed on time, landed early after 1 hour, bags all. Very well behaved passengers too. But no service was needed, no service was offered, no service need reviewing. Like boarding a bus and getting off. In summary for a short flight esp if you fly from Changi, Scoot does not appear to be a budget airline. Warning, fly Scoot from another country and over a long distance, you will notice the difference!",0

2019,"Tokyo to Singapore via Taipei. Keeping in mind that this is a budget airline, everything about it is budget, but it was below my very low expectations - I feel for the staff who are just trying to do their job as directed by the company. First the positives - everything was hassle free, they are super on-time, no delays, 100% efficient at doing the important bits of getting you from A to B. But it stops there. Because we bought an upgrade after buying a meal for economy, we were not allowed to change our meal option from what we had paid extra for. Tip: it is best to buy a meal but do not choose anything otherwise you are stuck with it. The seats are uncomfortable and they are tilted forwards such that you are sliding off the seat the entire 10 hours of the flight. The foot rest doesn't do anything, and it only reclines six inches, both combined, you are still sitting completely upright. The seat belt sign is always on for some reason (even when there is no turbulence) and you are not allowed to use the bathroom half the duration of the flight (exaggeration). The food is not bad, but portion size is small. And finally the staff are not happy and they show it. It must be a horrible company to work for! If I had a choice I would choose a different airline but we needed a one way ticket and all airlines flying this leg charge a kidney and half a liver for a one way ticket!",0
2019,"Worst customer service ever. I flew Scoot from NRT to TPE and they deliberately did not load our baggage on our return flight. They put many people's suitcases off to the side at check in, and didn't tell us these bags wouldn't be on the plane. When we arrived in TPE it was chaos. None of the staff knew what was going on and we had to fill out a form to fill out a form later to get our bags. It took us 3 days to receive our luggage. The day after we landed, I emailed Scoot and sent a letter to their headquarters. I finally got a call from their customer service center 3 weeks after our flight. All they did was ask if we had received our bags. No compensation, no written apology, not even a verbal apology! I will never fly SCOOT again.",1
2019,"Hong Kong to Melbourne via Singapore. I have flown on many airlines and scoot by far has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had traveling in my entire life by all measures. Every experience with them has been frustrating and ridiculous. I have never encountered more unhelpful and incompetent people in my whole life than those who work at scoots call centers and airport transfer desks.  I tried to check my bag in online but the website links did not work, the app did not work, and it took 30 mins to get through to call center. The representative put me on hold after every question because it was clear he did not know how to answer basic questions. Finally, he informed me bag would have cost 400 Singapore dollars if I had checked it in at the airport counter! And this is insane considering how extremely difficult it was for me to check it in ahead of time with none of their websites or apps working properly.  I was wondering if they intentionally cause their website and app to not work properly so that customers who need to check a bag get trapped at the airport with a fee twice as much as the actual flight. I also tried to check in through Scoots app 3 hours before flight. To my panic, the app said that my flight had already departed which was entirely not true since it was 3 whole hours early! A kind of glitch like this is unacceptable on every level because of the panic that it would cause!!  The first of my two connecting flights were delayed 6 hours for mechanical issues and they did not even bother to notify me ahead of time. No email, no update on the app. The app said everything was on time! No one knew this under we got to the airport 6 hours early and had no options. Even when I had spoken to Scoots call agent to check my bag earlier, they did not mention this. I luckily found out through my travel agent, and since I was going to miss my connection, I had to make a new flight plan. Scoot was so unhelpful and incompetent that I was mind-blown. I wasted my entire last day of my trip on the phone with them which they ruined entirely! For absolutely no reason at all, they refused to simply put me on a different connecting flight that worked out with the delay time and had available seats. They said that I would have to just fly to my connecting airport and just take a risk and see what is available. When I finally got to my connecting airport, no one on my flight had any idea at all where to go or what to do, and the Scoot agents at the transfer counters were clueless. They sent me to the entirely wrong counters and kept giving me conflicting info about my checked bag. I warn you against booking with them even if their prices are $100 cheaper than other airlines.",1
2019,"Perth to Bangkok via Singapore. Another very good flight above and beyond the expected standard. Scoot receives a bad press. A recent reviewer on You Tube complains at great length that the airline failed to deliver any of the services it never promised to deliver in the first place, and that it was all but impossible to remove the film covering his meal. I suggest next time this reviewer takes time to check Scoot's terms and conditions, as clearly outlined on the website, and the instructions on the food package. Like the reviewer, I had a choice for my flight. My choice was to fly business class with Scoot for $100 less than a 'full fare; airline charged for a seat in economy. This is cash i would rather have in my back pocket than frittered on pointless trivialities and trinkets I can live without. Taking things as I found them, check-in was rapid - Scoot had a similar number of check in desks open for a 787 as Emirates were prepared to provide for an A380, with consequential length of queue. Boarding was smooth, departure more or less on-time departure with an early arrival in Singapore. Staff were friendly and keen to assist passengers wishing to access the IFE. Food was OK, especially the chocolate, with a wider choice of beer than many other airlines offer. One gripe, though this seems to a common issue with the B787: the passenger cabin was far too cold. However, knowing in advance what was (not) on offer in the way of a blanket, I came prepared with a body warmer. Departure from Singapore on the connection was likewise on time with similar levels of service, my checked bag safely delivered along with myself in Bangkok. Suits me.",0

2019,"Seated in 5C, in a supposedly quieter part of the plane. The flight left late, and lost time, arriving an hour late in Berlin. I found the flight uncomfortable. I didn't sleep a wink. There are no frills on Scoot, even the usb port was charged for. The carpet was filthy and worn. I've been on other Scoot 787s, this one (reg 9VOFH) was really showing its age. I've flown Scoot 4 times, and I like the fares, but the level of discomfort was too much. I paid an extra SGD $50 for the quiet seat and it was a waste of money. It has made me reconsider taking budget airlines long distance. Singapore to Melbourne with Scoot, I can deal with that, but Singapore to Europe, I don't think so.",1
2019,"Perth to Phuket via Singapore. We were traveling as a family of 3. Wife, kid and myself. The kid was a minor so she didn't have a seat allocated. But Wife and my seats were allocated on different rows. Asked the crew onboard and they were helpful, though the flight was full she asked the couple seating on a windows seat which has 3 seats if they could go in business class which they agreed to and then she relocated us to the 3 seats. That was excellent for the staff to look after us, and also she kept checking with us if all was fine. Excellent Customer Service.",0
2019,"Took Scoot for a recent weekend trip from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Price and timing suited well so picked Scoot this time over the usual other choices. Flights were OK, on time, seats comfortable etc. Its a short flight so never bothered with food or any of that. During both flights observed the Crew taking their time to explain personally to the crew seated on emergency exit doors on emergency evacuation procedure etc. so that was quite good. On return to KL from SG, there was high volume of cabin luggage and the Crew really worked exceptionally hard to find space for everyone's bag, dont see that often. They actually moved the luggage and bags themselves to make room. Very impressed with that. Overall good, will try to use again!",0

2019,"Singapore to Perth. Not having flown Scoot before, given the negative reviews, albeit invariably from Australians, I approached the flight with a little trepidation. No worries! A couple of days prior to the flight I was offered and successfully bid for an upgrade at a reasonable price. Having arrived on a connecting flight I made my way to the check-in over 4 hours prior to scheduled departure. No issue. Fully automated with staff on hand to assist. No dramas during boarding or flight with 15 minute early arrival in Perth. Seating was something of a throwback to business class circa. 1980s - big hair, big chairs. Fine for a daytime flight but maybe problematic if overnight. The extensive range of food, as advertised in the menu, all available on board. Few so-called full price airlines can boast that. I had the pasta, not the worst I've eaten on a flight, the German chocolate quite delicious; Crew attentive regularly passing through to collect litter. The aforementioned carpers bemoan the lack of IFE etc. with Scoot. If that's important to you, fly Singapore Airlines et al at more than twice the price. Scoot does what it says on the tin. On this occasion I have no cause to find fault.",0
2019,"Singapore to Melbourne. I suggest you do not take this airline if you go for longer that 3-4 hours unless you are prepared to be yelled at by the stewardess for bringing food into the airplane. While I was eating my food a stewardess came and said to me that she'd let me go this time for eating an outside food, but ""NOT"" next time. I felt the treatment was very unprofessional and unkind. They should have mentioned it before we board the flight. Some of the attendants are rude. Another time I had a bad experience was when I asked some of the flight attendants for my thermos to be filled with some hot water, they refused, and wanted to charge me S$5 for buying a bottle water first, then they will give me the hot water after I paid.",1

Unfortunately, I was informed that my meal was not available once I boarded the plane. I was disappointed. However, I asked if it was possible to have the sides/snacks and to substitute my chosen main meal with another meal available on the flight. I asked the cabin staff if they could do this as I did not want to seek a refund. The cabin staff stated that this was fine. Generally, I found the cabin staff to be friendly and attentive.",0
2019,"Singapore to Perth. We paid an additional $55 each for emergency exits seats. The emergency exit row was divided into 3. 3 seats on the far left, 3 seats in the middle and 3 on the far right. We were situated on the far left. The toilets were located on the far right. The 3 emergency exit seats in the middle row were empty. After take off, I moved to the empty seats in the middle because I was unwell. I did this because I wanted to lie down, I wanted to be in closer proximity to the bathroom and I wanted to distance myself from the other passengers. Two staff initially asked me to move because the seats I was sitting on cost extra. This seemed like an uneconomical use of space considering there was no way for the airline to make money from these seats after the plane had disembarked. I explained that I had paid for an emergency exit seat but had moved to this row because I was unwell. They understood and let me stay. I woke up half way through the flight, moved back to my original seat and tried to eat something. After eating I felt a sharp pain in my abdomen, so I moved back to the same empty row to be closer to the bathroom. This time I sat upright, cross legged on the seat. An air hostess named marched up to me and demanded I move back to my old seat. When I asked her why I couldnt sit in an emergency exit seat closer to the bathroom she simply said it was company policy that these seats remain empty. She couldnt elaborate any further except to say that the pathway to the bathroom was not allowed to be obstructed. I moved back to my assigned seat but expressed that I was sick. Instead of empathising with me, she treated me as though I was being dishonest. She aggressively asked me if I had a fever. I said I did not but I had other unpleasant symptoms. She demanded I list all my symptoms in front of the other passengers. I asked her if it was really necessary to openly list all my symptoms because it was embarrassing for me. This did not appeal to her sensibilities and, once again, she demanded to know what my symptoms were. I listed my symptoms in front of everyone. This was very humiliating for me. She then said I should have told the staff I was sick at the beginning of the flight. I informed her that I had done this. She then told me I could lay down on the vacant seats but not sit up. It made no logical sense. Nate said she would tell the Captain and alert the ground staff. She delivered this as though it was a threat but I agreed this was ok because I had nothing to hide.  When the plane landed a medic was called on board. The medic asked me one question - do I have a fever? I said no and he immediately let me exit the plane. He said that he only needed to be called on board if I had a fever in the last 24 hours. However I had already told staff earlier that I hadnt had a fever, so why did she organise for a medic to board the plane on arrival? I feel as though she deliberately went out of her way to make me feel as uncomfortable as possible.",1
2019,"Bangkok to Gold Coast via Singapore on 29 January. The first flight from Bangkok to Singapore was all right, I had a stopover around 4 hours in Singapore to take my second flight. The plane took off at 10.40 pm (Singapore local time), and was supposed to arrived at 8:10 am on the 30 of January. But, after 2h30 the pilot inform us he decided to turn back to Singapore, because of a small crack in the window. We didnt receive more information. We couldnt reach the wifi to contact our friends and family to explain them the situation. After 2h30 we arrived in Singapore again. We had to wait 2 hours in the airport in the middle of the night (4:45am to 6:45am, Singapore hours), all tired, stress, and angry. For all of this inconvenience we received a small bag with snacks and a small bottle of water, so not even a proper meal. We finally arrive at Gold Coast airport at 2:10pm (Singapore hours) instead of 8:10am. So with a delay of more than 7 hours and with all of the inconvenience I suffered, I reclaimed them a refund of my flight but they just answered me ""that's not our politic, but we will provide you a 50$ voucher"". I Spent in total 16 hours on a plane and 22 hours at airports, for a one way ticket I paid 715AUD$, and I get a 50$ voucher, Its scandalous!

2019,"Honolulu to Osaka for a base fare of 80 USD, so I shouldnt complain. There are some things to consider if you fly with Scoot. Its ultra low cost in all aspects. Long lines for check-in which took about an hour. My bag was 20,8 kg and my hand luggage 5 kg. I had to shift some luggage to my hand luggage to prevent paying for overweight. In the end it doesnt matter because the same weight is going onboard. No wonder it took ages at check-in if they do this for everyone. I paid extra for the quiet child free cabin in front of the aircraft. Rows 4 to 8 are supposed to be quiet but it doesnt add any value because theres no bulkhead and with kids seated in rows 9 and 10 I wouldnt call it a quiet cabin. They strictly enforce the no own food and drinks policy onboard. Like a strict teacher a member of the cabin crew passed by every few minutes to tell passengers they were not allowed to eat food not purchased onboard. This was forbidden according to Singapore law. Just a lame excuse because there is no such law and its just a company policy to generate more revenue. Dont order meals online because you pay 15 US Dollar, while onboard it will cost you only 15 Singapore Dollar. I ordered a hot meal and a soft drink onboard. According to their menu it costs 18 SD, because you get 1 SD discount when you order a meal and a drink in once. I was charged 19 SD. I told them it should be 18 SD but they insisted it was 15 for the meal and 4 for the drink. Pointed them to their own menu and then I got the excuse that I should have ordered the combo deal instead of the meal and the drink. They simply do not think logically because its exactly the same. In the end I paid 18. Theres no IFE onboard, not even a screen with the flight time, arrival time, etc. The only entertainment is looking out of the window, which they also ruin because immediately after takeoff the windows are blinded until shortly before landing. Maybe this kind of airline works in Asia, but in Europe or the USA they wouldnt get a feet on the ground.",1
2019,"Manila to Singapore. Don't fly Singapore if the connector airline is Scoot! As a frequent flyer to Asia, I have flown Singapore Airlines ever since 1994, and have been delighted.  Scoot agents (not wearing any name tags) and its call center are unprofessional, heartless, untrustworthy, lacking of common sense or courtesy, and a disgrace to the once proud Singapore brand. My wife was at Clark Airport near Angeles City in the Philippines, trying to take a short flight to Singapore so that she could connect with the flight back home to San Francisco. Scoot personnel would not let her board her flight, without paying 90 dollars for a ""mysterious"" and spurious cancellation fee. She never cancelled. The agent had issued the tickets, there wasn't any rescheduling, but, they insisted. This was a scam to get her to pay them 90 more than likely. She did not have the money, she had spent all of her money on family in the Philippines.  Why would she show up at airport if she cancelled? You can't just cancel a roundtrip, you must reschedule, or there would be flags and notifications everywhere. The flight from Singapore was still valid, and they didn't know of any cancellation. Spent two hours on a conference call with our ticketing agent and Scoot call-center. They kept saying there was a charge, but for what, there never was a cancellation. Even the manager couldn't do anything. He said that I had to write an email to the sales department, can't call, and await response!",1
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Sydney via Singapore with Scoot. Good low-cost airline for long haul flights, horrible for short haul. While the short haul flight had the least leg space I ever had (it was not possible for me to fit my legs in the row) and was delayed by 2 hours, the long haul flights in the 788 and 789 are quite good. While food and inflight entertainment is not included, the prices inflight for lunch or snacks are fine and the legroom was fine. Service in Changi airport is always top.",0
2019,My first flight with Scoot. I was very sceptical and worried due to many negative reviews I saw on the Internet. But good experience overall. The flight was comfortable and cabin crew helpful and smiling. The aircraft was changed from TR3 to 777-200 leased from Singapore Air but this was informed well in advance. The negatives were that flight was delayed on departure by 45 minutes and same to Hyderabad. Luckily there were no terminals to be changed and my connecting flight from Hyderabad was after 5 hours gap hence saved. Another thing missing was the inflight entertainment.,1
2019,Singapore to Perth. It was a good experience flying Scoot on their Boeing 787.  The ScootBiz cabin is very spacious and the service was really great despite we had to pre-order our food. From check in to boarding it was smooth. No delays at all. All in all I will definitely fly on ScootBiz again.,0
2019,Flight delayed 8 hours in Melbourne which meant I missed my connecting flight to Bangkok. Was told I could wait 24 hours in Singapore for a connecting flight to Bangkok or wait 2 days in Australia for another flight. Chose to take the delayed flight to Singapore and fly Jetstar. Offered $50 voucher for 8 hour delay in Melbourne but still have not got it. I don't care about delayed flight it can happen with any airline but I should be refunded the flight from Singapore to Bangkok. Have rang many times and they just hang up on you.,1
2019,"Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore. Scoot cancelled our first leg of the flight - Bangkok to Singapore, without any reason or explanation and wouldn't even tell us when we were flying next until our third phone call! The lack of response was crazy. We finally got our delayed flight to Singapore the next day (and had to pay another night at a hotel as well as $70 in calling fees as they took so long). When we got to Singapore they still would not confirm our next flight. After a lot of persistence for 3 hours at Transfer desk they finally wrote a piece of paper with the flight no. and date, but no time or reference number to confirm we are definitely on that flight! We also paid for business class and they said all flights are full by the time we got there because we came on our""delayed"" flight which was their fault. Then they said to get our luggage at ""Lost and Found"" to stay overnight, and when we finally got there they couldn't find our luggage for 45 minutes!I'm still in Singapore now waiting for confirmation. I really need to get back home and they still won't confirm that I can definitely make it home by then! I can't believe the way they've treated everyone who's been messed around by their cancelled flights in Bangkok. Yet they're still not taking responsibility. I thought I'd try Scoot as they seemed not ""too bad"" and I took a chance, but never again Scoot.",1
2019,"Flew Hyderabad to Sydney via Singapore with Scoot. First they delayed the flight by 18hrs, changed our meal options, seating options and then at the airport the gate changed 2 times. Traveling with senior citizens and a 5 year old it was a very bad experience.",1
2019,"Singapore to Osaka. Overall, I think that Scoot is a great airline and offers value for money.  My seat was very comfortable despite being very slim in design. I was worried that I was going to have a sore lower back after sitting for 6 hours on the plane and purchased a cushion at Changi Airport before my flight. However I found that I did not need it. The food was good. I paid a little extra and got a premium meal. I had Nasi Goreng with Chicken Satay. It came with a potato salad and Haagen Dazs ice cream. The meal I received was better than some of the meals I have had on full-service airlines in recent years. It was well worth the extra money. I did not have a premium meal on the way home. However, what I chose was tasty. I watched movies on my I-Pad on the way to Osaka but on the way home I paid for the inflight entertainment. I thought that there were a good selection of movies and tv shows. It is well worth paying for on a longer flight like mine. The selection was better than some other airlines. I had no issues on the ground staff or flight attendants. In fact I found the staff to be very friendly. My flight home was delayed by about 30 minutes but this did not concern me. Overall, I have booked two more flights with Scoot since this experience.",0
2019,My return flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore both delayed and rescheduled without proper reason. It significant trouble passengers. When you suppose to touch down at 11pm but at last you end up reaching at your destination 2 hour later than original. All the time cost and travel cost nobody is going to compensate you. Have heard a lot of comment that Scoot delays without reason and I choose not to believe at the first place since there might be a exception. But end up I becoming one of the victim.,1
2019,"Honolulu to Osaka. Scoot far exceeded our expectations on every account. We were skeptical of flying a cut rate airline and read a lot of (good and bad) reviews prior to booking, but we couldn't turn down the bargain price, so we expected the worst and hoped for the best. We figured it might be an adventure in traveling, that was worth saving the couple thousand dollars we would have spent on a mainstream airline. The only trick was I wasn't able to book a one way ticket on their website, so booked it though Kiwi.com. No complaints about Kiwi.com - everything went according to plan. Seats are not assigned in advance, nor could you check in online, but we arrived early and so check-in was easy, the people were pleasant and our seats were assigned together. Note that they will weigh your bags so pack according to their specifications. The plane was a brand new Boeing 787 - (amazing technology) - it had comfortable reclining seats, and we actually were able to spread out as there were empty seats next to us. You need to bring your own entertainment or download the scoot app for movies before you get on the flight (which I didn't know until we were onboard). The food is ala cart and on demand, which was nice. There were many options, and while the food isn't cheap I was happy to pay $18 for decent airline food after saving hundreds of dollars on the flight. The flight was smooth and the stewardesses were professional. We arrived a little early and the light show as we landed was a fun touch. The only thing we are sad about is that we didn't fly Scoot earlier and that Scoot will be discontinuing service to Honolulu in June 2019. Better go while you can take advantage of great prices!",0
2019,"Singapore to Melbourne. The flight left Changi 20 minutes late and arrived 10 minutes early, which is always good. The 787 has a pleasant interior. I was right at the back in 41A. Lots of leg room there. Scoot are a budget airline, so no frills. I ordered the mushroom lasagne and wine, $19 for the combo. The lasagne was hopeless, no discernible cheese, overpowering taste of low quality tomato sauce. I have eaten Asian dish on Scoot before and it was fine, so that'll be my choice in future. Scoot are not special, but from my experience they do their best.",0
2019,"Denpasar to Berlin via Singapore. Staff and flight wise everything was great. However my flight from Singapore to Berlin was nearly an hour late - leading me to miss a connecting flight on another airline. Scoot showed no accountability for this and offered nothing in the way of compensation to what ended up being a costly error for me. I wish I could say my flights were cheap enough to offset the cost, but they weren't that dissimilar to that of higher rated airlines - I just assumed with it being a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines that the quality of the flight would be reduced, but you'd end up with the same customer service - apparently I was mistaken. I won't be flying with Scoot again as their customer support in the event of a mistake is terrible. I would only ever consider flying with Scoot if it was direct.",1
2019,"Guangzhou to Singapore. Flight was very full with uncooperative passengers. Situation was slightly chaotic and I had 3 young kids (under 7 years old) travelling with me. A steward was very professional, genuine and lovely with repeating his instructions to passengers, speaking to my children and interacting with his colleagues. A not so pleasant flight that was made better with him on board.",0
2018,Singapore to Bangkok. Flight was delayed from 10:05pm to 2:30am the next day. I was unable to find out the reasons for this. I think such long delays are unacceptable without detailed explanations. I will probably avoid using this airline in the future!,1
2018,"This is the worst airline I have used. I flew from Singapore to Melbourne on Dec 3. I checked one bag in. When I got to Melbourne my bag was not on the plane. I went to the Scoot baggage desk to let them know, the women behind the desk never turned on a computer to see where it was, she just wrote my email address down on a piece of paper and said the baggage should be on the next flight the next day and that they would call. Nobody called so we call them and her answer was ""its not on the flight today I will have someone call you again nobody did. this same scenario has been repeated every day for a week now. When we try to call back, it is the same thing every day we get a recording stating that there is no one there please leave a message and still no one calls back. Even though they state they are open until midnight. I have sent many emails some have been answered some have not. they all say the some thing ""we are trying to track your luggage but have no record of it"" even after I have given them the tag information. I cannot understand how my bag has disappeared into thin air. Unfortunately scoot could not care less. I was in Australia for a wedding and had to buy all new clothes.",1
2018,"Bangkok to Osaka. First flights on Scoot in their ScootBiz cabin, which is misleading as it is very much a premium economy product. On balance it was a good experience, and in line with my expectations. Both flights were punctual, check in and boarding were reasonably efficient (you'd expect such at KIX, less so at DMK, but both were good). I was quite impressed with the cabin crews - they were very professional, warm and efficient. Seats were comfortable enough, although don;t expect lie flat, just a bit more recline. The only real negatives were 1) quirky IFE which runs on your laptop, tablet or phone - despite multiple downloads of plugins, flash players, etc I encountered compatibility problems throughout with hardware, browsers, etc and ultimately just gave up - this is far harder and more complicated than it should be, 2) on the outbound flight DMK-KIX the biz cabin was filled with babies and infants (due to school holidays in SG and MY I am guessing). I actually had a mum with lap child in the seat next to me and there is no way the child was under two years old (ie - needs a ticket). With all of the crying/screaming, etc I voluntary downgraded to the economy 'quiet zone', where the crew gave me a full row to myself - felt it was the right decision and appreciate the crew's assistance in ensuring my comfort. It is ironic though that Scoot charges more for economy passengers to sit in a quiet zone, yet offers no comparable alternative for biz passengers who are paying more money for their seat - this makes no sense to me, and 3) the whole idea of paying for in seat power (economy only) is another example of the pay for play model of low cost carriers, and suspect will be more broadly adapted by competitors. To summarise, the experience was good, not great, but acceptable. One additional insight re AirAsia X, Jetstar and Scoot long haul - Jetstar and Scoot are very similar experiences (both Dreamlines with 2-3-2 configuration with limited recline - Air Asia X the better product due to their flat bed offering on the less attractive A330.",0
2018,"Osaka to Chennai via Singapore. I'm used to flying with budget airlines so I know what to expect but I think Scoot are ridiculous. Firstly, they changed our flight time so that we had a 20 hour stop over instead of a 1 hour stop over and would not respond when we contacted them asking there were any other flights available. Their policies regarding food (that you are not allowed to bring your own food on board and instead have to buy theirs at extortionate prices) are just mean. Lots of people say that they are not enforced but I witnessed staff telling people to put food away multiple times during my flight. In fact my main problem was with the staff in general. They were consistently rude and unprofessional; when we were checking in the woman serving us rolled her eyes and mocked us to her colleague right in front of us. Whilst were on the flight I did not feel well and asked for a glass of water but was told that water was not complimentary. About 15 minutes later I vomited and again asked for a glass of water but was told it would be $4 for roughly 200ml. Not offering free water for flights that are 10 hours + is ridiculous, but what struck me here was the lack of concern by the staff. She did not ask me if I was okay or make any effort to make the flight more comfortable. Do not fly with this airline.",1
2018,"Singapore to Osaka. The worst airline I have come across so far. I travel a lot, but never encountered such poor customer service. They cancel flights and you have to run months after them for a refund.",1
2018,"Ho Chi Minh City to Male via Singapore. After reading everyones comments I thought I would share my negative experience. We arrived at the airport to check in to fly to the Maldives only to be informed that our flight had been changed and left earlier that morning and no one bothered to contact us! I was told by the people at the airport I had to call the help desk. I rang the helpdesk and had a very rude staff member who told me there was nothing he could do as there were no other flights to the Maldives. He offered me a refund in vouchers for the company. I told him I did not want a refund in vouchers if he couldnt get me a flight and I wanted a full refund to my account. He said he would put me on hold and transfer me to the correct person to talk to. He then hung up on me. I tried to call again but couldnt get through, have sent them an email and still waiting. Due to them not informing us about our flight change we had to book new flights which were over $1000 nz dollars, we had to stay two nights in Singapore so more money spent on accommodation, not to mention the money we had already spent on accommodation for the Maldives. This one inconsiderate act costed us a lot of money. Would never recommend this airline to anyone even if it was the only flight.",1
2018,"Tokyo to Bangkok. 2 hours waiting in the plane, after that they say flight cancelled and give us 9 us$ Voucher for food. We lost our next flight and hotel in Bangkok but they do not refund us for that.",1
2018,Kuantan to Singapore. Very bad customer service.  Just don't care the customers even they can help us to check in before 45mins departure. Many of us cannot check in and missed the flight and our flight ticket just waste for nothing.,1
2018,Singapore to Taipei return. I am writing in to compliment the cabin crews onboard both flights. I felt they have discharge their duties very well and I'm highly appreciated them for their service onboard the aircraft. I was very warmly welcome by the crews onboard. Scoot is a budget airline but the high service standard is really very good.  I deeply appreciate their commitment to keep passengers safe &sound for their flight.,0
2018,"Singapore to Taipei. Two weeks before my flight, Scoot cancel the flight and simply sent an email to notify passenger reschedule to next day without and reimbursement to passenger. If passenger not accept reschedule, passenger had to call in Scoot helpline. The helpline totally disable, tried call 3-5 times with waiting more than 1 hour and finally reach the operator to answer. The operator was unfriendly and keep asking passenger to accept. I'm booking front seat with paid. but Scoot operator like act blur and because A320 was cancel changed to Boeing 787. And to continue get the front seat i still need to top up another $23 and get the same day flight and late for 3 hours flight. For the return flight, the flight is scheduled depart on 16.10, but take off time was 17.00 due to unknown reason at Taipei airport. Totally horrible services provided. For return, I paid for front window seat, but the seat is so near to the window and not comfortable. i will not take Scoot again, even thought they willing to bring down the price. They are a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, but their service is totally different and the attitude is bad to passenger.",1
2018,Perth to Amritsar via Singapore. We paid $200 more on 3 tickets for getting 4 hours stay instead of 7 hours stay stay in Singapore. But we still had to sit in the airport for 7 hours because flight got delayed to match with the other connecting flights to save money for the airline. I dont know why we had to pay more if we were going to have same flight. We booked vegetarian meals on the booking day and on the day of flight they said they do not serve vegetarian meals which is disgusting that you keep people hungry on the flight even when they have paid for it. When we asked for water and tea on the plane they said thats not covered we had to pay for that too. Ill never get on scoot again and will never recommend.,1
2018,"Singapore to Athens. Lost my luggage, asked for more money to check me in and worst service ever. It's been already 5 days that I arrived and I'm still waiting for my luggage. I had 2 check in luggage, the first arrived one day later but still awaiting the second. When I went to check in at Singapore they made me pay 21 SGD saying that my e-ticket was not confirmed, even though I had received the confirmation and was never contacted from them. The crew wouldn't allow people to spread so as to get more comfy saying that if you want to change seat you have to pay extra. I'm definitely not flying with them again.",1
2018,"Tokyo to Singapore. We check with hand baggage and normal bag. They made us pay 7200 for check in because it was more than 10KG per person, so we needed to pay this money yes or yes at the counter or otherwise we could not fly. After all this, we go up to the plane. So small seats and uncomfortable, the plane was making the sounds of the Steward Call every time without reason and lights were going on and off constantly during all the flight, basically we couldn't sleep even 1 minute because of this annoying things. We could not even connect to the wifi so we tried to eat something as a last choice for pass the time, but the food was so bad and at the same time the most expensive food I've bought in a plane. I asked for asahi beer and it wasn't even cold! Definitely not going to repeat this airline ever again. Scoot for me the worst airplanes and service ever.",1
2018,"Osaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. According to 2nd statement on https://www.flyscoot.com/en/customer-service-plan , I should be receiving my refund after 20 business day the latest, yet I received the refund email after 8 weeks had passed and I need to manually request the refund again via email, then I was told I need to wait for another 15 days, this added up to more than 2 months which is equivalent to 64 days, more than the triple of the promised refund period. I was truly disappointed.",1
2018,"Singapore to Sydney. Scoot should never be allowed to use the description Business to describe the front on the nose seats of their airline. This is clearly no higher than an economy X minus the included food and beverages and service. In fact, apart from some extra leg room and a larger seat, the rest is sub par to most other major airline economy services. The food you pay for and order is below average, no tea coffee or water (after the first small cup) is offered for free. Scoot tv is complicated to get on with an android phone and stops over 1 hour before landing. And Business Class don't even get to disembark the plane before everyone else as the exit door turns out to be behind the front nose section! Just think paying passengers should know they might not bother paying for more than Scoot economy, especially if they're expecting a little Business Class service.",1
2018,"Singapore to Bangkok. Our initial flight from BKK to SIN were also delayed. The problem with they delay was that they were not honest with how badly the flight would be delayed. For our flight from BKK to SIN, we were told that the delay would only be 30 minutes, but it ended up being a 1.5 hour delay. The plane was filthy because they didn't have time to clean it properly. My tray table had coffee stains, it was sticky, and the toilets stank to high heavens. A stewardess on the flight told a passenger who had an onward flight from SIN to Australia that the flight to Australia would be re-timed for their sake as there were 7 of them on the flight. On our flight back from SIN to BKK, the flight was re-timed for 2 hours later. We were only told when we arrived at the airport. One wonders if my flight was delayed because other flights into SIN were delayed, and as a result, they delayed other connecting flights so they wouldn't have to put them on other planes. A terrible experience. Our seats on the last row could not recline at all.",1
2018,"Honolulu to Osaka. Terrible airplane that didnt have WiFi or movie services working. Flight attendants rude and didnt speak English very well. Have to pay for everything from water to food and its overpriced like you cant believe. $20 for a frozen meal. Upon follow up and trying to contact customer service, my case was closed 2 times before I could really discuss my issues. Basically got hung up on via email. They dont care about your experience so go to someone who does.",1
2018,Penang to Singapore. Really positive customer service experience. I was unable to fly due to medical grounds and the customer service representative was very professional and helpful. She guided me through a refund experience that would have been complicated at other airlines. Scoot made it easy and seamless. I was very impressed with my correspondence with her.,0
2018,"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. For a budget airfare getting you to destination and plenty of in air service with drinks and foods. You get what you pay for and that is fine. No heavy turbulence,  aircraft in good shape take off and landing good. Managed to change my flight for another holiday and that was bit back and forth but managed to do that online for a reasonable price. Layover 2 times went smoothly, staff friendly and overall satisfied for getting me safe to my destination and back.",0
2018,"Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore. Currently sitting at Changi  with practically zero information on our overnight flight that was due to depart at midnight. We were advised very late of a 6 hour delay, flight not scheduled to depart until 0600. Surely the airline knew about such a significant delay before now. My Scoot flight was also delayed coming over here from Sydney for 2 hours, seems standard for their service so keep in mind there is a good chance you will get stuffed around if you fly with this airline. Knowing the absolute barebones approach, shoddy customer service and what it seems consistent delays, this will likely be my last flight with Scoot. I would be careful booking with such an inconsistent service if at all, best avoid in fact, pay the extra $50 and fly with an airline who is organised and punctual.",1
2018,"Scoot lost our bag on the flight from Sydney to Berlin with a change in Singapore. When we landed in Berlin, our bag didn't reach the final destination. We reported to ""Lost and Found"" of Tegel Airport immediately. It's been 4 days and they still can't identify location of our bag. For your information: it's 19 kg big bag - did it just simply disappear? I've read a lot of similar stories of people who lost their luggage on Scoot flights. It raises a lot of questions towards this carrier.",1
2018,"I was pleasently surprised by Scoot. I flew from Berlin to Phuket via Singapore. Especially on the long haul flight from TXL to SIN Scoot provides a good product when you consider their low fares. I was sceptical at first after reading some devastating reviews, but Scoot proved them wrong. The 787-8 aircraft they use for the Berlin-Singapore service was very clean and the seats were actually pretty comfortable. Considering the low fare, there was enough legroom, even for a person with 188cm in height. You just have to be aware that you have to pay extra for everything, even a small bottle of water costs 4S$. And you should bring enough entertainment options in form of preloaded Amazon or Netflix videos on board, because there will be no free entertainment system on board of their aircrafts. All in all I can recomend flying with Scoot, when you get a good deal on a ticket.",0
2018,"I am writing my mothers flying experience with Scoot on scootbiz. My mother is a 77 year-old diabetes patient with walking difficulty who walks very slowly with a cane. She speaks and reads no other languages but Chinese. Given that shes not a seasoned traveller and with the language barrier, mum felt stressful when travelling on her own. Mum flew with me to Sydney for a short holiday in September and on the return flight, I was unable to fly with her due to work commitments. I therefore applied with Scoot for a special assistance of taking her through the security checking, immigration checkpoint as well as leading her to the right boarding gate as the boarding pass is printed all in English as well as providing a similar assistance at the arrival hall in Singapore. Very much appreciated by both mum and myself and very thankful that the Scoot crew both at the check in counter as well as the cabin crew had been very patience, approachable and understanding of her conditions and had been taking great care of her on the plane making her felt at ease and removing her stress and worries by going extra miles of cracking jokes with her. This is especially so when Scoot had also arranged, at the arrival hall in Singapore, to had her wheeled out of the aircraft, led her to the immigration checkpoint as well as assisting her collecting her 2 pieces of luggage (40kgs in total) which is too heavy for an elderly to remove from the conveyance belt. This high quality of service provided by Scoot which may not be as considerate in other airlines, is highly encouraged and appreciated by elderly solo travellers. Will definitely flying mum with Scoot in the future.",0
2018,Singapore to Sydney. It is a good practice to always check the flight status online on the airport website regardless of which airlines you are flying with. It gives you the most recently updated flight details including any retimed instead of relying on the details provided in your booking reference. My flight with Scoot had been delayed for 45 mins but it didnt bother me due to the fact that I had obtained this info online before I travelled to the airport.,0
2018,"I recently booked and flew Scoot  and had unbelievably poor service. Having booked and paid for my ticket several months in advance, I was most surprised to receive an email about two weeks out from my flight advising that my sector from Singapore to Melbourne had been replaced by a Singapore Airlines charter. The email contained several links for various responses. As I had booked and paid for an extended legroom seat to mitigate a back complaint that I suffer from, I was concerned when I read that all pre-booked anything such as seats, meals or other services had simply been cancelled. When I tried contacting Scoot, none of the links worked. I tried emailing on several occasions, but all my inquiries went unanswered. I eventually tracked down some phone numbers to their call centre, but all my calls went unanswered. When I eventually arrived in Singapore from Europe, I finally had success on the day before the flight from Singapore to Melbourne and managed to get through on a local number. I was then informed that the Scoot call centre had no visibility of the flight and could not provide any assistance, despite being the same call centre to contact that had been mentioned in the original flight cancellation email. When I got to the airport, I found that I was going to be jammed into a middle seat in economy class. Apparently, the extended leg room seats had been auctioned off and as I hadnt been able to make contact, I missed any opportunity to make representation to secure the seat that I had already booked and paid for! After a lengthy stoush at the counter where I had to be quite assertive to achieve an audience with a supervisor, I was finally successful in at least getting an aisle seat. Clearly, they were not happy with being taken to task as on the trip home the cabin crew made sure that any part of my body (I am 63) that slightly protruded into the aisle was deliberately bumped as they went past. They were rude and aggressive when I protested their actions. When I left the aircraft, I was in considerable pain from the cramped seating I had endured and required pain killers for the next two days. My recommendation: under no circumstances fly Scoot as they do not provide the flights or seats that they advertise, have no empathy for customer health needs, are deceptive, mendacious, rude, aggressive and clearly have no interest or intention of providing any reasonable level of customer support or service. Despite their written assurance that I will receive a refund for the seat that I paid for, to date I have not received a cent, so add dishonest to the list as well.",1
2018,"Flight delayed by 5 hours with no explanation. Seat layout 3x3x3,  9 across width of plane so very cramped and very narrow aisles when staff pushing trolley down isle. $5 if you want water. Want to charge your phone or other device - $9 charge! Also had credit card comprised via Scoots ""bid for biz"" process from inside Scoot as email included every detail relating to myself and flight details. Resulted in cancellation of credit card 48 hours out from travel. No interest in this whatsoever from Scoot staff even though this could also happen to any travellers on Scoot. Customer support line also left a lot to be desired - very difficult to get them to understand the issue and gave up after one and half hours on phone to them. Never again Scoot, you lost me and my six travelling companions.",1
2018,"Sydney to Phuket via Singapore. We took 4 flights (2 each way) and all flights were late to take off, ranging from 30 min to 1hr 55 min. hile waiting almost 2 hours for the first flight from Sydney the staff looked to be very stressed and there seemed to be little effective organisation. Once we took off the flight was uneventful and the staff were friendly and efficient. The Boeing 787 was a new plane with good legroom for economy. I did not eat any food so can't comment. The next flight (also late) was an A 320, much older and more uncomfortable.Two more delayed flights in the reverse on the way back. 10kg of carry one luggage was a good amount. It was weighed at each stop so don't think you can go over the limit without penalty. We arrived at the stated gate on our boarding pass gate 82 and found a staff member who had been sent there to redirect passengers to gate 15. I couldn't help but think that this is a very risky way to advise passengers and how easy it would be to miss your flight if that person did not find you! The next and huge problem was that the arrival time printed on our e ticket and announced by the captain was incorrect by 1 hour. Daylight saving had commenced the week before.Therefore our arranged pickup as per our ticket arrival time was 1 hour earlier. I messaged the company from the tarmac as we were arriving in the hope that they were able to wait and luckily they had gone to the other terminal and then returned. We drove away and then had to return again for another family who also had been given the incorrect arrival time. I have no confidence in the organisational power of this airline. The captain was following the incorrect information he had. I would not recommend as 4/4 late flights caused us a lot of angst and we could have missed the connecting flights had they not been hours apart.It was also the middle of the night with no where to rest with children.",1
2018,"The short flight from Jakarta to Singapore was typical of Asian budget airlines. No free food, drinks, and no entertainment, but everything went smoothly.",0
2018,"I travel 3 persons from Penang to Sydney using Scoot via Singapore. On my way back I increased my luggage allowance and at the same time choose all 3 seats. The sector for Sydney to Singapore was well done with the correct seat but not for Singapore to Penang. I choose seat 10 D/E/F but was given seat 26 E/F/G. When I feedback to their customer service.. here is their explanation after having spoken to them for over one hour on the phone - article 3.7 of our Condition of Carriage, we reserve the right to change your seat at any time, even after you have boarded the aircraft, for safety, security, operational or other reason at our sole discretion. As such, we regret that we are unable to accede with your request for a refund. I would adhere to the change of seat but even for this at least an explanation on the time of boarding will help ( but not done) and that Scoot should be courtesy enough to refund for not being able to provide the service. Though it is a small amount but this teach me a lesson of never take Scoot again.",1
2018,"Tokyo to Sydney via Taipei / Singapore. Food and drink service almost non-existent. Food pathetic, especially for business class. No inflight entertainment, not even a screen on the back of the seat in front. Some passengers able to connect to a plug in the armrest and watch a movie on their mobile phone. Very unsatisfactory. No business class lounge at Tokyo or Taipei. First and last Scoot flight.",1
2018,"2 delayed flights in one month due to late arrival of aircraft. First time, you could blame it on accident (although no explanation was provided). Second time in the same month on the same route shows a flaw in aircraft / route management. Each delay was at least an hour. The worst part is they didnt inform us well in advance as to the delay or how long it is expected to last. I would not fly Scoot again if theres an alternative.",1
2018,"Singapore to Hong Kong. Not bad for a budget airline. Aircraft was new and had legroom significantly more than some budget carriers, and it pushed off on time. Crew looked professional, well trained and were multilingual. I have heard of horror stories but thankfully it didn't happen to me.",0
2018,Bangkok to Singapore. We booked a flight to Singapore at 7pm for the same day at 11pm. We went for check in at 8pm to be told the flight was cancelled. The staff mentioned that it got cancelled the day before! Why did the website allow us to spend our money for nothing? They mentioned that it was not cancelled but delayed to the next day at 1pm. We tried to call the call centre multiple times with no answer.,1
2018,"Absolutely disgusting, would not fly with them again! When I booked it didnt give me any info or luggage options. It already wasnt a cheap flight. Then I rang and checked and they said I had no luggage included so I went online to add it and it came up in Thai baht as 2675 which is Aussie $114! I rang again which took several days in fact, as after ten times calling after ten mins it would cut me off. When I finally got through they said because it was a connecting flight they charge me twice! Never have I struck this, even with the most budget of budget airlines they dont do this! And on top of that they charge double the normal rate as theres only 20 or 25 kg so I had to go with 25 and its about $57 per flight! Thats way over normal and to charge twice too! I will never fly with them again! And as a loyal Singapore Airlines customer who regularly flies with them, as they are the same company they have lost me completely. I wont fly with them again either. If I had known this I would have chosen a different company. It really wasnt a cheap flight so the whole budget thing doesnt stick with me. The whole thing has cost me about $700 one way when you can sometimes get that ticket fir $300. So its insult to injury!",1
2018,"I was with a party of 10 with a flight going from Cebu to Phuket via Singapore. Our flight got cancelled due to a damaged tire and some part of the wing. Scoot made sure to house us in one of the best hotels in Cebu nearest to the airport. The next day since we could not make it to our flight frm to phuket, they had us stay at the Crowne Plaza in Changi airport. Although we missed 2 days of our stay in Phuket, we nevertheless had an awesome time together as a family especially with the dinner and breakfast buffet spread we had when we stayed at both hotels. What was supposed to be a case of delays and cancellations turned out to be an unforgettable experience for the whole family. Scoot made sure to take care of us and made it so much easier for us despite the several days of delays due to the connection. it was not their intention to delay or cancel our flight because it was a technical issue and for our safety, it was best not to push the flight on the set original date. We appreciate all that you did to me and my family. This trip became all the more colorful and adventurous because of the efforts you made for us. I sincerely thank you for everything you did for us. Thank you. Customer retention at its best! I am a customer for life with Scoot.",0
2018,"Singapore to Sydney. I have never been more frustrated in my life dealing with anything, as I have trying to get a fair customer outcome with Scoot. I had booked two seats with extra legroom for my wife and I, as we had a young infant flying with us and needed extra room. Without notice, they had changed the aircraft we were flying on, and the seats I had chosen were not extra legroom seats any more, they were just ordinary seats.  There were more spacious seats available, but the crew insisted we had to pay to change to them. Anyway, that was not the frustrating part. Ever tried to get a refund from Scoot? I will tell you it is probably impossible. You would think it is straight forward: I paid for extra leg room seats -> they did not give me extra leg room seats -> therefore I should get a refund? Not so simple. I had paid $158 for the extra leg room seats, they told me they cannot refund me the whole amount as I had selected seats during the booking process so they had to charge me a seat selection fee (something like $20). I proceeded to tell them that the only reason I selected the seats were because I wanted extra space as we had an infant with us, not because I liked 11D and 11E. ""Sorry sir, it is our policy"", but they cannot actually point to this policy in any of their policy disclosure documents. No one I spoke with seemed to understand the basic concept that if I pay for a service and do not receive what I paid for, I should get a refund. They said they will escalate it and call me back. Three months had passed, no call. I call them back, have to re-explain myself, and they said they will escalate and call me back. This went on for a year (can you believe that). I have called again today, and concede just to refund me whatever they saw fit, guess what? They are escalating and calling me back soon. Oh and another thing, Scoot will never give you a cash refund, only in Scoot vouchers. Why would I fly scoot every again after an experience like this? This is the hardest I have ever worked for $158 of vouchers.  I guess that is what you expect from a budget airline. But at least I would expect fair treatment, which I definitely have not received from Scoot.",1
2018,Manila to Singapore. Scoot rescheduled our flight for an earlier one. I even paid for the seat I chose which is the window seat. But when they rescheduled our flight we were seated in the middle seats. It really messed up our plans for that day. The worst part is the tickets are non refundable.This is the first and last time I'll ever fly with them.,1
2018,"Singapore to Jakarta. Having read a number of negative reviews of Scoot, I have to say that people are obviously missing the point. Yes Scoot is a budget airline, you pay for every extra, but having been a Scoot passenger for over 3 years, flying from Singapore to various locations in ASEAN, I cannot fault the service. Yes, flights are occasionally late, but that happens with every airline now and again! Reasonably priced tickets, even cheaper if you book far in advance,  you pay for what you want to use, and if you don't want it, don't pay, simple as that. As for the comments about being pregnant, any sensible person would have obtained a letter from their doctor prior to the flight clearing stating how may weeks pregnant you are and that your doctor is happy for you to travel. As long as you don't exceed the airline requirements, 32 weeks as per Scoots website (did you not check before you flew?) As for complaints about excess luggage charges, you can purchase additional luggage online prior to your flight, you know if you need more luggage before you get to the airport. The comments about kids not sitting properly and being difficult. Being a parent myself, yes some kids don't like flying, but that does not prevent parents from following the rules of the airline, including bringing non Scoot food and drinks onto the flight. If you want a cheap flight, fly budget, if you want free water, and a great cabin crew, fly full fare scheduled airlines. At the end of the day, its your choice as its your money! Overall, a great value for money, with a normally happy crew of Scooties. Keep up the great service Scoot.",0
2018,Singapore to Amritsar. The services are very poor. Everything is paid and quality is very poor. They don't even provide free water to their customers. The behavior of the crew towards the customer was also bad.,1
2018,"Osaka to Singapore. The check-in staff made me miss my flight. I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time, travelling with my husband and 5 year old son. They were not sure whether I needed a medical certificate. It took them 1 hour to check, telling me they were sure I did not need one. After 1 hour, they said the flight was closed and did not make any attempt to let us board. They asked me to pay to change my tickets for the next flight, which was a non-direct flight leaving 4 hours later, when I had paid for a direct flight. I called customer service, which said I should pay and make a claim later. At the end of the day, we took the next longer and non-direct flight, arriving home at 3am. This has been the most unpleasant check-in and flight experience I encountered so far.  I lodged a complaint with Scoot and never had any reply.",1
2018,"Singapore to Ipoh. Having read preceding reviews (and other friends experiences), I booked Scoot with fear and trepidation. However, as one of the few airlines flying this sector, and as it was a short flight, I decided to take the risk. Buying online was uncomplicated, but I did feel the additional fees for payment (credit card, NETS, AXS) were a little high - I know budget airlines charge for everything, but surely the administrative costs for payment are not that high. Check-in at the kiosk was uncomplicated, I didn't pay for luggage so headed straight for departure. Boarding was supposed to be by seat row number but it basically looked like everyone just headed in, so I did the same. Aircrew were pleasant enough but not terribly enthusiastic, though safety checks were done professionally. Seat pitch on this A320-200 was adequate, but I felt the seat cushions were a little less comfortable than on other airlines: adequate for the 1 hour hop, but perhaps less so if it were going to be longer than that. I bought no additional services, so didn't expect anything else. Arrival was on time and disembarkation was uncomplicated. In total, a simple flight that left on time and arrived on time. Other than the relentlessly cheery branding ""Scoot!"", the overall experience was good!",0

2018,"Flew from Tokyo back to Singapore and return with transit via Bangkok with Scoot. Never in my life have had such bad service throughout. Long wait to get through the call center to end up with ""I need to put you on hold to check"" with every question I asked and getting an absurd answer which did not make any sense. Got told off by check in staff at Narita  because our soft unstructured carry on was 6 cubic cm over the limit. 3. Got screamed at no food during transit because we bought orange juice for the kids. And comment given ""You must  buy our food. Forced us to wake the 2 year old up to be buckled up in his seat. And woke up the 7 year old because he is not seated properly with legs down. On return transit, got told to hurry up by ground crew from passing security to gate. Whilst they watch us dragging 2 groggy kids + hand luggage.  After the whole fiasco, we appreciated the flexibility and understanding of 2 member of the crew. Male crew on flight back to Singapore who saw the fuss brewing, explained nicely their situation, moved the other passengers and helped arrange the sleeping 2 year old. Check in staff at Singapore who handled the situation nicely on the check in bags. While I know that every airline has different policies to adhere to, I believe it is fair to expect some courtesy and customer centricness. They had really good planes no doubt, however the service was really uncalled for. Living in both Japan and Singapore where services are known to be top notch. This came to us as an even bigger shock.",1
2018,"Singapore to Bali. I am so unsatisfied with Scoot, I decided I shall warn anyone who is considering booking. We booked Singapore to Bali, and each bought 1 check-in luggage with the ticket. But we ended up having one extra luggage, instead of charging us one extra luggage fee, they requested us to pay for $20SGD per KG for excess weight , which equivalent to total of $400SGD for one extra luggage. On our return flight, SIN to Taiwan, we experience very bad customer service with the ground crew who were giving us attitudes. The seats on the plane were extremely small, Im only 5 tall and my feet was already touching the back of the seat in front of me. I had a snack which I bought in the airport , and was told to stop eating because the airline does not permit any outside food and no water was offered on the flight. This is less than a budget airline! If you are connecting in Singapore, Scoot is actually a poor choice because it does not have a transfer/connecting counter inside terminal, which means you have to exit the terminal of arrival, goes through custom, collect your luggage and then check in again! You will  miss your flight if there is not 3 hours connecting time. Whereas other airlines have connecting counter inside terminal and you can easily transfer and check in. Anyways, this is my last time flying Scoot, never experienced such a bad service!",1
2018,"Singapore to Perth with Scoot. Flight to Perth delayed by 3 hours due to tragic circumstances on inward flight. Boarding crew handling information to outgoing passengers facing the delay, delivered in a very sensitive, respectful and compassionate way. Top marks to all crew involved.",0
2018,Singapore to Bangkok. Value for money. No fuss smooth online check in. Staff onboard was accommodating and professional. Pleasant short flight. Take off and landing was also stable.,0
2018,Singapore to Gold Coast. First of all flight was late almost 2 hours. I paid extra to have a seat by the window to have a better sleep. Seat was broken that I couldn't let it down. Asked to put me to sit somewhere else. They said no available seats only if I pay extra to sit in quiet zone or extra leg room. They gave me broken seat what i paid extra already and refused to give me other seat. It would not cost anything to company if they would put me to sit somewhere else.  I wrote to them and it took like a month to respond and all they said was oops sorry we will fix the seat. Like how's that going to help me? Never ever fly with them again!,1
2018,"Melbourne to Singapore. On 11 Aug 2018, flight TR25 at 9.40 pm was cancelled after we checked in. Sad to say we had yet until today received SMS or email informing us about the cancelled flight. We were not even assigned our next flight home. Third party staffs in Melbourne dont handle the case professionally. We were left stranded for hours not knowing what is the next cause of actions. We were told hotel fully booked and they cant checked on the system on the status of our next flight home. When problems like this occur dont tell me SCOOT staffs are sleeping on this matter. Be considerate and think about those who need to work on 13 August. What choice do we have? No choice but to book our next flight home on our own expenses at about RM9000. Is not a small sum for 4 pax. If SCOOT had taken the trouble to offer us the next flight home, do we need to do this? Our actual cost paid for our flight from Launceston to Singapore via Melbourne is about rm4500 for 4 pax, supposed to be low cost. But now we ended paying about rm9000 due to no fault of ours. Imagine the ordeal of waiting. To wait for the next flight(no updated info) and Calls centre were totally useless. I would like Scoot team to handle the case more professionally .",1
2018,Bangalore to Singapore on 17th Aug 2018. The gap between the seats in this flight was barely 6. When I sat my knees kept rubbing on the back of the seat in front of me. This was a midnight flight and 4.5hour long. I can say this was the most uncomfortable experience I have had flying.  We certainly will recommend scoot on this sector based our bad seating experience,1
2018,"Bangkok to Singapore. Scoot doesn't accept transit passengers and in order to connect in Bangkok, you have to go through immigration, check in, and go through immigration again. Both flights are international for Bangkok, so, this is only natural to do all this in transit hall of the airport. We had to make the visa to go out (USD 60 each). So, the budget airline became super expensive suddenly.",1
2018,"Penang to Krabi. This is a bad experience when buying the ticket for travel in September. The price is 103 at the beginning, but I key in the wrong phone number, so I try to back and correct again. But! The flight ticket jump to 109. Ok is fine. Then I fill up all the details. But when I press the payment, the system change the price to 112. Okay, I feel like not worth to buy it, I try to search again, the price become 119! I feel like this not fair to the customers. When knowing the customers buying the tickets, the system can change the price! This airline totally is vampire. I really feel bad while buying the flight tickets.",1
2018,"My trip to Singapore is only for 6 days and Scoot delayed the flight 1.5 days. Cant contact by phone from 11pm despite there is 24 hours contact.

So angry because they delay this by 1.5 days without any repay, just apologies and we don't need their apologies. Worst airline ever.",1
2018,"Gold Coast to Kaohsiung via Singapore. Low cost airline? I think not! Price: It seemed to be a low cost option at the time of looking for our flight. Ultimately it was not cheap. Considering how long the trip was with long layovers in Singapore. However, still had to contend with the limited options of a low cost airline. The online booking process has many stages of options that one needs to wade through. The tally keeps growing until one reaches the end with a bill the size of one from a more comfortable airline. This is the only airline I've come across that offers  nothing included free. Baggage: We were travelling for one month so chose to add 20KG. Pleasingly they do include 10kg carry on. Scheduling: They arrived on time and left late due to no fault of their own they tell us. The thing we're really fed up about is the forced long wait at Changi. Three times this has been a feature of our flight. There never seems to be any short layovers. Of course this may just be the legs we are flying. Both legs of this trip required long (20-22 hours) waits at Changi. We spend $200-$300 each leg just trying to have a place to rest and eat. Again contributing to false economy. Food: In flight options are not clear for a person with food intolerances like myself. No food labelling. Not even water is provided free. What you do pay for is shockingly small for the amount of money you pay. Staff were not particularly friendly, though not unfriendly they just didn't seem to care much. Would we choose them again? Not likely.",1
2018,"Bali to Singapore. After take off I laid back my seat, right away a girl behind me starting kicking my seat and after a while I asked her if she had a problem with it, she said she didnt have space for her legs. I said it was not my problem and told her to stop and call crew. I turn around and she pushes again. I called the crew member and explained the situation, he said he couldnt do anything so he just told her to stop. She stopped for about 20 min and kept going, she pushed so strong that she even made the seat go back to the normal way only by kicking it. I called again and the lady said Im sorry theres nothing I can do and I didnt see her (the girl was admitting what she had done) and then told the girl I understand you dont have space Im so sorry, Im gonna see If we have a bigger seat for you. She didnt want to change so the lady just told me Im sorry its only 40 min left please just try to hold on. The lady just said she couldnt do anything while the girl kept laughing with their friends. At the end a cabin crew guy understood me, said it was my right to have the seat how I wanted to and offered to change me and my friend. The girl just got away with it and nothing was said to her. Also no food or drinks were offered free in a 2.5 hr flight.",1
2018,"Singapore to Bangkok. UOB Singapore had a Krisflyer promo where they could waive they credit card booking fee but upon payment the Scoot website will prompt that you must log into your scoot insider account. When you do that they will revoke all UOB Krisflyer benefits, charge you a credit card fee and pretend to give you a ""15% off welcome voucher"" that after applying the voucher the amount will the same as before the voucher with additional of credit card booking fees and extra 5kg baggage fees. I tried calling the call center 6 times each lasted around 1 hour as all the ""let me put you on hold"" and final saying ""we will escalate it and we will get back to you"" then you will never hear from them again. When you call back stating the person you spoke to the person will always be ""busy"" and the whole process repeats itself. Don't fly Scoot because once they get your money, you will only get ignored.",1
2018,"Athens to Melbourne via Singapore. Scoot brought forward our flights by 5 days! This cut our holiday short and we lost money on our accommodation and holiday! I heard that this was a problem with Scoot so I had left a few days buffer. Not 5 days! They could not book us a new flight until 5 days after the original flight. Customer service over the phone was robotic with long periods of ""please hold"".",1
2018,"Singapore to Berlin. Scoot started flying to Berlin Tegel from Singapore Changi only recently, and I caught their latest flight to the German City. Kiosk check in & bag drop was seamless, and I was allocated an aisle seat, much to my relief. I would not have wanted a middle seat for a 12hr flight on a budget airline. Seat was what one would expect from a standard low-cost carrier - Average legroom with no entertainment. I had pre-ordered a long haul meal for the journey, and the food was largely decent. Crew were largely polite and professional. Value for money for a trip to Europe.",0
2018,"Manila to Melbourne via Singapore. Thought I would give scoot a try, and certainly glad that i did.  The planes were clean and roomy.

Well done to everyone at Scoot airlines.",0
2018,Singapore to Amritsar. I am not comfortable with the flight because they do not provide a mobile charger point. I felt very uncomfortable.

Value of money not worth it, yes its cheaper compared to other budget airline but end up spending more because of the delayed flight and the reason is their is a technical issue on the plane that can not resolved. Flight delayed from 12:55 am to 3:30 am. With those people who have connecting flight not advisable to take this aircraft. The worst customer service. Flight delayed and nobody offered us a drink, ground staff at Singapore said those with connecting flight someone will assist us (delay team), upon arrival to Philippines, flight stewardess said we can approach the ground staff at the counter for assistance, ground staff not helpful as no instruction from them from Singapore and staff told me to call their office. No feedback form, no apologies even after I told one of the staff I missed my connecting flight although I paid 2x more for the rebooking of the ticket what makes me upset is I need to wait it the next day for the next flight.",1
2018,"Had no problem with fees, checkin, carryons, food or fees. Food was good and much better than United and Hawaiian. Luggage fees were fine and very clear up front. The quiet section (no children or movies) was great but has no way to charge electronic devices so bring batteries. I recommend you bring your own water and snacks as these are rather expensive onboard. My main complaint is the temperature of the cabin  nears 80 degrees F so rather hot for US passengers, seems norm for Asian passengers. Bring water! Easy to press light and flight attendant call buttons on arm rests. Watch out! Love those windows you can lighten and darken. Going to try Air Asia next!",0
2018,"Taipei to Singapore. I was on Scoot biz on the 22nd of June heading back home from Taipei. It was my 2nd flight with Scoot and I am very impressed with the crew on ground and onboard. The check in staff was polite and efficient even though she had to handle a big tour group before us. After getting onboard, we were greeted by smiley and polite cabin crew when offered water and confirmation of our meals. It was a great start to the flight. Soon after take off I tried to charge my device with the in seat power supply, however it wasnt working. We informed the crew in charged and was quick to get a response that the seat power supply for both 2h and 2k was down. I was disappointed but was lucky to have my own portable power bank. A few moments later, the crew in charged passed me a pink power bank and she explained that its her own personal charger. She apologised and went the extra mile and took the initiative to offer me hers even though I didnt ask for it. During the flight, she was seen helping 2 elderly couple in front of us with the Scoot tv app. She kept coming back to check on them and it was when meal service was about to start. I understand thats a very busy period for crew but she was professional and very patient with them and assisted them for at least 20-30 minutes and had left me very impressed. She was also always seen in the cabin during meals and duty free sales service. During the lull period, while walking to the lavatory, crew was also polite to inform me that there was a queue. Toilet was also clean the whole flight. Call lights by passengers around me were also quickly attended by them or passing crew from the economy class. I didnt expect much from a budget airline but I am left with a great impression with this experience. I will be looking forward to flying with Scoot again.",0
2018,"I have had a mixed experience flying with Scoot. My flight to Athens from Sydney was uneventful and easy, however my inflight meal which I purchased at the time of booking the ticket was quite rubbery and not hot. This isnt something Id write a bad review over, however my experience on the return flight back to Sydney has been absolutely atrocious. After attempting to purchase additional baggage online multiple times on separate devices the website failed and crashed many times. I was finally able to get through and pay for my extra check in luggage ($123) the night before the flight. Upon arriving at the airport to check in on time, I was told I was unable to because o had an outstanding balance of $83 to which they couldnt tell me what it was for, but if I didnt pay, I wouldnt fly. Not only could they not explain this fee, the attendant who was handling this issue seemed to be incompetent with their system and couldnt get it to work. Although I wasnt exactly sure what was going on because she ignored me as if I wasnt there and would stop intermittently and fill a stapler with fresh staples! This went on for so long that I had my baggage given back to me and told I had missed check in and now had missed my opportunity to get my flight. There was zero communication to myself as the customer, no attempt by the staff to be helpful or treat this as an urgent matter to assist me in getting this issue sorted out, and no apology for the fact that this was an operational fault of Scoot as an airline. I was upset at the fact that I had now missed my flight, and the attendant that had been supposedly helping me simply rolled away in her chair and sat behind a desk messing with receipts. Not to mention the huge line of frustrated and ignored people behind me waiting for assistance for a separate flight. I cant believe how horrible this experience was as a customer. I hope the airline improves on this in the near future, because Id hate for anyone else to have to go through what I experienced today.",1

During the flight, my wife wanted to go to the lavatory and the chief stewardess help her with the door and into the cubicle. My wife can't stop sharing about how well she was treated on board with her friends and relatives. Thanks Scoot for the great flight.",0
2018,"Phuket to Sydney via Singapore. I had relatively low expectations when I booked being that Scoot is a budget carrier. However I was very impressed overall. Giving an 8/10 based on comfort and relativity of price. On the Sydney to Singapore return legs, very new Boeing 787. Seats were comfortable enough (and I'm 6 feet tall). Service was efficient and cabin crew were polite. On the legs Singapore to Phuket we flew ex tiger A320 aircraft. Fairly new. Interior a little bit tired but seats were comfortable. No in-flight entertainment, but I just used my iPad and downloaded a few movies on Netflix. We experienced a delay on our return leg from Phuket to Singapore, which we thought may cause issues with our connecting flight. However staff managed the issue well and gave us updated and information where to go on arrival at Singapore. And last of all, if you have to have a stopover, why not make it at Changi airport. It's rated best in the world. Free cinemas, pool, butterfly garden. Lots to keep you entertained. Would definitely fly with Scoot again",0
2018,"Pretentious and unprofessional. We generally avoid Scoot but for this routing the timing and fare were the best combination we went ahead. Most important: we arrived on time and safely, and so did the luggage, so no complaints about that. But in general this airline is really annoying to fly. Their business class doesn't even have paper towels in the bathrooms - you can dry your hands on facial tissues. No blankets - unless you want to pay $15. (Oh, and though it's a Singapore based airline they charge for extras in USD - because they are bigger.) No entertainment - not even screens. Seats recline somewhat. Food varies from not bad to quite mediocre. Service is officious and rigid - even when there were only ten people in the business class cabin they couldn't bring themselves to be flexible on mealtimes. Everything is about the rules, nothing is about the passengers. I don't think that's the fault of the crew - it is probably the management. Trying to check in on line from Tokyo was impossible because the website - whether the JP website or the SIN website - only supplies Singapore as a point of departure, there are no other choices. Condescending - the pilot refers to the staff as ""our Scootees"" - as if they are owned property. It's basically a run-of-the-mill low-cost airlines with pretensions. I wouldn't say avoid at all costs; I would say expect a quality of service and professionalism a little below AirAsia and you will probably get what you are looking for.",1
2018,"My daughter and I took the flight on 24th May, at 6am, heading to Taipei from Singapore. The flight was very full. The seat that I sat on was broken as it could not recline. I informed your air stewardess, who then tried to make the seat work but failed. She informed her colleague, an air steward, who came over to check the situation. He offered to change our seats to a functioning one. After he went to look for vacant seats, he came back and told us that there were no two empty seats available together but that there were unoccupied ones in the quiet zone. He was very helpful and led us to the quiet zone and helped relocate our heavy luggage overhead. His attitude was sincere and indicated a willingness to help and I was very grateful for his service.",0
2018,"Athens to Melbourne via Singapore booked for August 2018. I have wasted a lot of time and am still currently chasing up a refund requested in January upon Scoot deciding to reschedule my flight to 48 hrs later without a reason. The same issue happened to my sister who was scheduled to fly 2 weeks earlier - coincidence I think not. They have taken over 3 months to process and approve the refund, and have now sent to the wrong account so I am having to go through a dispute claim with my bank. Not worth the waste of time or the effort of dealing with unhelpful help-desk staff who force you to play phone tennis with your bank and them to resolve an issue they have caused.",1
2018,"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. Absolutely terrible, invasive staff. I was on my way to custom check out, Scoot staff me to check our hand carry luggage, we had 4kg extra and the staff wanted me to pay the price for 20kg. I was completely fine with the process, until I told the staff I would reduce the weights, she went ahead and took our boarding pass away. I was furious, never in all of my flight had somebody took our boarding pass while waiting to sort out the luggage. I'm also Scoot frequent flyer. The services and regulations are vastly inconsistent.",1
2018,"I will never go with this low-cost airline again. Boeing 787 from Singapore to Athens, on a 11 hour flight I expect a tv and and at least a free bottle of water for the money you pay, but got nothing! If you wanted water you had to pay. It was shocking, never again.",1
2018,Bangkok to Singapore. Departed late from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi by about 20 minutes due to plane arriving late & hence arrived in Singapore late by about 10 minutes. Was seated in the emergency exit row & hence there was ample legroom but seat could not recline. Cabin crew were generally courteous and professional.,0
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya via Singapore. This is the first time I fly Scoot. Somehow I do have a high expectation, since it is the low-cost subsidiary from Singapore Airlines. But my journey was quite dull. The interior of the aircraft is pretty much empty. The seat does not really recline or just broken. In comparison with other low-cost airlines, if the ticket price is way reasonable, I would not take Scoot again.",0
2018,Singapore Changi to Bangkok Don Muang. Flight departed on time and landed right on schedule. Got allocated the last row (42) which sadly could not recline but still not too bad for a short flight although having no one in the middle seat helped. Crew were polite and courteous - no more no less. Surely would fly with Scoot again in the future!,0
2018,"Scoot cancelling or changing planes without letting their customers know. We booked 4 tickets in December for a flight from Singapore to Perth on 30 April. Unknown to me Scoot's booking system was apparently still in ""summer mode"" and Scoot changed to ""winter mode"" which mean that our flight was cancelled. Scoot claims that they have let me know via email that our flights changed but I never received the email. The SMS they apparently sent to my work mobile did, not even came up in a search of my phone records. I had to purchase a last minute very expensive flight on Qantas because Scoot messed up, however when I asked them to refund my expense they claim that they have a no refund policy. Be careful to book with Scoot, this flight cost us 8x more than planned and our complaints were met with a no responsibility and no care attitude.",1
2018,"I flew from Singapore to Melbourne without any problems so some of the ratings below refer to that flight. However, Scoot's organisational abilities and customer service leave a huge amount to be desired. I had a Scoot booking to fly by Virgin from Canberra to Sydney and by Scoot to Singapore, to connect with a separate flight to London. Scoot changed the flight departure time but didn't tell Virgin so I was not allowed to board the flight. After hours of phone calls from the airport the only solution was to catch a Singapore Airlines flight for over AUD $1,500. They insisted that I had to pay for it myself because (despite being a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines) they were not able to, and they promised they would repay it. Four weeks later they still claim to be checking the paperwork.",1
2018,"I read the reviews online only after booking with Scoot and I was very worried after seeing so many negative reviews. However, I had a very smooth, comfortable flight with no problems. The aircraft was new, spacious and clean. The staff were a little blunt but not rude. I paid for the Nasi Lemak and it was good and also came with a water and chocolate. As someone who always flies with LCCs Im used to being treated poorly while flying but this was a really pleasant experience. I would 100% fly with them again!",0
2018,Manila to Singapore. I had the worst experience from an airline in my life. It was unbelievably disrespectful and I was unfairly treated in Manila airport. Missed my flight due to long queue in the immigration despite checking in early and the flight took off earlier than departure date but thats not the problem. The way I was treated at the gate was a disgrace. Instead of trying to listen to my queries I was bombarded by remarks where its not the airlines fault and its entirely all my fault and the airline is not liable. I was only trying to raise my queries 1) what happened to my ticket 2) whats the alternative to get to my destination. At least I get an idea what can I do next. But all I get is a small piece of paper with the customer service number to reach out to (called the number and all I get was voicemail - all executives were busy). Managed to get through once and while verifying the phone got dropped off. The most surprising thing is all the staff at the gate just left! Left me by myself! I had to hunt for my luggage somewhere at the 4th floor of the airport and again! No one was there. They had no idea where my luggage was and they made me wait at the corner for 45 minutes at around 12.30am. This is disgraceful for an airline. Whats worst is how I was being treated. Maybe those staff are just hurrying to go home with their bag packs. Absolute disgrace! Maybe its a one off but this is the worst experience Ive had in my life!,1
2018,"Had a need to clarify my wife's (and infant) portion of our booking. I called the support line to ask about what can be done within the scope of our ticket. I spoke with one of the most proactive and helpful people I could have hoped for. To my surprise, she had provided me with options to save me a substantial portion of money. I was really thankful for this and to Scoot for acknowledging things change in peoples lives and being able to accommodate this.",0
2018,"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. Appreciate the supervisor on our flight to HCM . My husband is elderly and uses a walking stick and has weakness in his legs. When he boarded the flight, the supervisor noticed he was a bit unsteady at the entrance & was kind enough to allocate us a seat near the front 3 D/E, instead of our counter allocated seats in row 30. On our return flight, the counter supervisor also kindly asked the booking staff to allocate us a seat near the entrance, again it happened to be 3 D&E. We thank the attentive staff for their assistance.",0
2018,"Gold Coast to Chennai via Singapore. I paid extra for extra legroom seats and for food and beverages. On boarding the aircraft, I discovered that my seats are not extra legroom seats. The staff refused to help me in any way despite having paid extra for those seats. All they offered was that I may get refund for the extra charges if I pursue with airlines office after completion of our journey. Food quality and quantity were both pathetic.",1
2018,"Haikou to Singapore. Was on the flight returning to Singapore and was fortunate to have an attentive flight attendant who went extra mile to care for the passengers on board. Scoot, a budget airline but you do not get budget service.",0
2018,Bangkok to Osaka via Singapore. Worst ever. Flight information notifications confusing and misleading. We knew that no free meals would be provided but were astonished to be told that passengers cannot consume any food or beverages they bring to the plane. Not even drinking water is provided unless you pay. Was told that the planes used to have water fountains but they were removed. How mean is that! Our decision: never again!.,1
2018,"Singapore to Krabi and return on Scoot. Despite being ""low-cost,"" ticket price similar to full-service affiliates Silk and Singapore Airlines on comparable-length routes. A320 was an old, ex-Tiger aircraft with extremely limited seat pitch; I'm only 178cm and my knees dug into seat in front of me. On both legs the aged leather seats had an omnipresent, unpleasant, and distinct smell. On-board entertainment non-existent. On-board food laughably expensive; $15-20 for just a standard economy class size economy main-dish without any accompaniments. Hand luggage policies strictly enforced on KBV-SIN sector, but boarding efficient. Crew a far cry from competitors and were practically invisible. Both flights departed on time, though return was still a bit late. Punctuality is all you can reasonably hope for when flying low-cost airlines, but given the high cost of the ticket, I still didn't feel I get what I paid for. You can't expect much when flying a low-cost carrier, but Scoot falls far below even its low-cost competition - and it has plenty in the region. It's striking that the same group that does full-service so right at Singapore Airlines can do it so wrong at its low-cost subsidiary Scoot.",1
2018,"Bangkok to Tokyo. Most horrible airline, worst customer service. Tried to pay my baggage online and the web page wasnt working properly. They charge me almost $80 when I checked in, none of the people working in the counter were able to facilitate the way of payment. Flying with this airline is as nasty as flying with Spirit, RyanAir etc. They will have you pay in any way they will find. Will never fly with this company again.",1
2018,"Singapore to Taipei on a narrow body aircraft. We did not opt for food, in flight entertainment or checked in baggage. The seats were acceptable but the leg space was rather narrow. The toilets are clean but just that since it is a smaller airplane there are few cubicles and we had to wait. On the return journey, we sat on a wide body (2 aisle) plane, leg space was better, there were more toilets and cabin crew were attentive. In general, the staff are polite and ready to help. The airline is alright for a budget airline. A tip when booking flights is to wait for the price drop and get notified,",0
2018,"Singapore to Melbourne. For the price it is excellent no frills, just pay for services that you require. Ensure you have a embossed credit / debit card, or take cash. Singaporean visa / master cards not accepted in flight unless they are embossed. Some staff wont take your card, but explain to them, and try - it works. Overnight flights can get cold so take a blanket, or buy on-board. And if you are leaving any airport other than Singapore, pay the extra for priority check in. well worth it!",0
2018,"Sydney to Athens via Singapore. It's just a shame. The first flight was delayed 30 mins before boarding (""because they were cleaning the plane"") and then, once we all had boarded, around 50 more minutes without any explanation. On the second flight we landed more than one hour later. I think it's crazy that they don't provide you even a bottle of water. You are stuck there easily for 12 hours and you don't get anything. Even if it's a low cost company you are still paying! I tried to buy some food and they don't accept debit cards so I didn't drink or eat from Singapore to Athens. Of course they don't have screens for entertainment. The air conditioning was crazy freezing. Many people complained (an old guy had a huge argument with one member of the crew). Conclusion: pay a bit more and be treated as a human.",1
2018,"I flew from Singapore Changi to Sydney on 12/2/18. What a mistake. The queue at Changi was horrendous - we waited 2-3 hours with minimal desks open and like a cattle market. The plane was basic, no screens, no ability to purchase wifi on computer - but you'd forgive this as it's budget. But stocking enough food for the flight is basic, and did not happen. Landed at Sydney and my luggage did not come. 5 other people were affected. It's a direct flight, how do you lose luggage? They made me a property irregularity sheet (with no reference number) and simply said wait till we contact you. I had no clothes, no belongings for 3 days. You ring the customer services and you can't get through, if you do they cut you off (happened twice) because they can't be bothered or may be they are trained to do it. They eventually returned me my luggage but no offer of compensation, nothing.",1
2018,"Flew Scoot from Nanjing to Singapore. It is important that anyone planning to fly with Scoot, has to take note that you don't need to purchase premium seats because they can be changed without your knowledge. Assigned other premium seat as a result. Scoot uses its Condition of Carriage as an agreement that they can change your seat without prior notice. If you want premium seat, you can always do an upgrade onboard the aircraft. There have been many cases against Scoot and majority lost their fight, therefore their Condition of Carriage can be use as a mean to exploit customer expectation.",1
2018,Flew Scoot from Singapore to Hanoi. My visa had the wrong dates and I was not going to be allowed on the plane to Hanoi. The check-in agent told me a customer had a similar situation last month and was able to secure a visa letter online quickly but it cost a bomb. I searched it online and was able to secure a new visa within 15 minutes and was able to make my flight! Without that agent's suggestion I would not have had my weekend break in Hanoi! Thanks so much for the extra service.,0
2018,"Flew Scoot from Singapore to Krabi. The departure gate kept on changing, and when I finally found the correct one it said Ho Chi Min City on the Gate display. This was not corrected till departure and caused lots of confusion. Flight delayed by an hour, no explanation given. No announcements were made, so everyone had to guess when boarding starts. The plane was an ex Tiger Air plane, rather worn and dated looking. The food and drinks were highly overpriced in comparison to Air Asia. The 'hip and young' image Scoot tries to give itself looks rather tacky and fake to me. Its a budget carrier well below its competitors.",1
2018,"Phuket to Perth via Singapore. This was my first and last flight with Scoot. I was ill in Thailand and needed to return home early. I tried to change my flights at Phuket airport but Scoot staff were not interested and there was no manager available . They gave me a phone number to ring - no answer. They gave me another 2 numbers to ring - again no answer. The email address for Scoot did not work either - takes up to 10 days to answer. The next day, Scoot charged me 3 times the amount I paid for the flight home . So in addition to the flight which I did not use (7,880 bahts) , I was charged 23,700 bahts for the early flight home. This amounted to 31,500 bahts or AUS$1,278 for a one way flight to Perth from Phuket. Do not use this airline if you need to change flights. Avoid at all costs. I regret ever using them and never will again.",1
2018,"Phuket to Singapore. Booked flights online for me and my girlfriend. When we checked in at the airport 2h30 mins before, Scoot had split us at 2 different parts of the plane. No reason given and despite showing the booking, nothing done (flight full). They wanted to have a printed itinerary. Great example of how clueless Scoot can be with their customers, there are way too many other cheap airlines in SEA to avoid them. I don't see any added value to picking them and I do travel regularly.",1
2018,I wish I had seen the reviews on this awful company. I have booked a flight to fly from Perth to Singapore this August with a connecting flight to UK a couple of hours later. Scoot decided to cancel the original flight completely. They offered me a later flight but I told them it would not be any good as I would arrive in Singapore after my connecting flight back to UK. Customer service was absolutely no help. They would not give a refund or an earlier flight. Please be very cautious when booking with Scoot. They make the rules purely for their own gain. I will never use these again.,1
2018,"Singapore to Bangkok. We scoot regularly and had been since Scoot started its service. Scoot was very good initially but changed from being good to bad and now worse. Over the past two years we had our flights rescheduled occasionally but recently all three of our bookings, Feb, Apr and May, flights have been rescheduled delayed by a few hours causing us a lot of inconvenience. Their Call centre was not interested in assisting, the lady who attended me was very rude and loud, instead of trying to help and understand the frustration and inconvenience they have caused their customers, she arrogantly told me Scoot have every right in the fine print conditions to reschedule their flights and any request for change of flight would incurred cost. Perhaps Scoot needs to remember there are other budget airlines and they are providing better services. The good reputation they painstakingly built is now being tarnished by the present appalling services. We will never Scoot again.",1
2018,"On February 11, 2018 we traveled with ""Fly Scoot"" from Singapore to Chennai. From Chennai we had transfer to Sharja. Before checked (check-in) our tickets we understand to it have imposible this transfer (in Chennai) for us. he FlyScoot ground staff immediately helped us. They gave us all support both in airport in Singapoure and airport in Chennai. Without their help, we wouldn't have got home. The flight was on time, the service was at the top level - flight crew, food, WC-clean and hgih speed Wi-Fi. The seats were wide and comfortable. The plane was B787 Dreamliner - by my opinion the best plane on nowadays.",0
2018,"When choosing a budge airline, we definitely begin with some low expectation. With Scoot, you got to expect even lower, then lower it again on the Singapore to Zhengzhou route. At Singapore Changi Airport, Scoot Check-in is not automatic. They definitely make sure to make everyone pay for the extra kg on their hand luggage, not at the counter, but with separate crew/staff who buzzes around each and everyone of you to make you pay. So be careful, weigh your luggage and make sure it is below 10kg. The seats are close together, tight. Surprisingly, at Zhengzhou Xinzheng Airport, Scoot counter is very friendly and up-to-standard. This was not expected at all. The ground staff is professional and helpful. For budget travelers in the early morning or mid-night scene, it could say a lot about local hospitality. In the end, Scoot costs not less than other airlines. I will get back to China Southern, or Xiamen Airline. Scoot no more!",1
2018,"Flew Singapore to Jakarta. 1) The way that Scoot is making money is ridiculous, after check in, there are staff who go around checking the weight of cabin luggage and purposely look for an extra kilogram and demand payment for it. Poor man behind me was forced to pay for his extra 1 kg! 2) Entry to aircraft - a passenger with a wheelchair was treated as a second class passenger as nobody was assisting. 3) Dirty and oily seats, magazines, all around you was just not hygienic.",1
2018,"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. Travel Insurance what a scam. I went online to book a return ticket to Thailand all went well past the flight from point of origin, then came the fun part, the web site opened a second link continuing with my booking, I paid for all and felt little unusual having to pay in 2 different segments one there in AUD and one back in Baht, so far all good. Then I read the fine print a few days in re my ticket, saying I'm only covered with my travel insurance while on flight to and fro, no holiday no time outside the airports, contacted the insurer being part of Scoot and the excuse was they insure the trip out but another insures the trip back. I said I want a refund they told me to contact scoot - now after 3 emails and no reply links so we cant continue the conversation - only after a number of days. Every time you submit an email again it takes up to 10 days. The frustrating thing is with such large companies there is no direct input to record your side of any story in hard copy or email. And no refund I needed to get new travel insurance. I will never fly with them again.",1
2018,"I want to leave my feedback on the poor service we got from Scoot on our return flight, Amritsar - Singapore on 6 Feb. We experienced a delay of more than 3 hours. Our flight was supposed to leave Amritsar at 6h40am and left after 9h30. No explanation is given but the staff were very thorough in checking all the luggage with a couple of kgs above the limit so they could charge the overweight excess to the passengers. Scoot kept 200+ passengers waiting for more than 3 hours without proper explanation or apology. After a 5h30 long flight, we arrive at Changi Airport (Singapore) and are told to wait because the aircraft doesn't have a place to taxi. We wait 45 min inside the aircraft, again with no proper apology or any kind of proper compensation. On a full flight with plenty of families with small kids, they don't even have the courtesy to give out some water for the children. To top it off, we reach the belts area to collect our luggage and our flight is not even announced on any screen. The passengers have to go around and guess which belt is our luggage being dumped on. For a flight that costs 400SGD return, the service offered is shamefully poor. It shows lack of professionalism and respect for customers. It shows that the airline is more interested in making a profit on overweight charges than on the comfort and wellbeing of your passengers. Don't recommend.",1
2018,Singapore to Jakarta. This plane looks outside and feel very old inside. Overhead compartments in our row are being filled up by passengers sitting in the far back; that's 4 of us seated in 1 row with just 1 carry-on and yet no space in both side of our overhead compartments ! The staff requested we checked in our hand carry which inconvenient us since we put our important items in there. We have to take almost everything out and put them in a plastic bag so we can put them in the pouch in front of our seat while the carry-on bag was checked-in.,1
2018,"Taipei to Tokyo. Scoot nickles and dimes you, constantly makes you painfully aware you chose economy. They charge you $4 for a bottle of water, Taipei does not have free water and an hour long security/out immigration before which you have to empty bottles. They will separate families in different rows. They won't let me use last two seats in aft of the plane saying there is a S$20 fee each for them. The checkin staff took 15 minutes reading every page of my canadian passport like a magazine, where people behind me got seats at other counters. The final verdict - flight is full, sorry for bad seats.  No wifi, food is expensive, no customs forms for Tokyo, sorry. CEO says bad days of discount air travel are over, I think he meant ""its going to be worse"" They have deep pockets (owned by Singapore Airlines) but they are miserly, staff is polite and courteous but machine like, lack empathy - that's culture of Scoot, superficial.",1
2018,Gold Coast to Jaipur via Singapore. I am writing this review on the bad experience I had while travelling with my kids and old aged parents. We checked in from Gold Coast and got our boarding passes for our next flight to Jaipur in Gold Coast itself. Upon entering our flight to Jaipur only them we realised that our seats were the last row which does not recline at all. We checked 14 hrs before the flight yet we got the last row. The staff were were not helpful when we asked for help to change our seats saying the flight was full. To add to our misery our hand luggage had to be kept in between our legs as the overhead compartment was full. The hot meal pack food is pathetic. Other then that no much choice and very expensive. They don't even give water for free which is the basics. Absolutely pathetic experience - with the extras cost it comes as expensive as any other airline.,1
2018,"Sydney to Bangalore via Singapore. I picked this flight solely because departure from Sydney was at 1.30 pm, layover at Singapore was 2.50 hrs then arrival at Bangalore would be 10.55pm the same night - they delayed my flight at last moment and mailed that information to me at about 11.30 pm the night before departure, so late i couldn't make any alternate arrangements. The delay was 2.0 hrs long - if it was 3 hrs or more the airline would have to issue every passenger a $50 voucher - however flight landed at Singapore 2 hrs later than scheduled. Before boarding the staff at Sydney airport promised me that my connecting flight and stay arrangements would be sorted once I met the staff at Singapore - my connecting flight had left 2 hrs before I landed, staff was overtly rude. They patched me up with a much cheaper flight which would leave 8 hrs later (overnight stay) - upon asking about the accommodation , they asked me to lay around at the airport. Biggest lesson of my life - never ignore the reviews about airlines before booking flights.",1
2018,"Taipei to Seoul. The terminal number was not clear on email ticket. Result was going to the wrong terminal. Long queues at check-in resulting in getting to the ticket desk between 0 to 8 minutes beyond check-in time. Check in staff simply say ""check-in closed"". Refusing to offer assistance or allowing passengers without check-in bags to receive a boarding pass.  Overall very unfriendly staff. Not able to reach Scoot by phone. No offers for a replacement flight. Will not be flying Scoot again.",1
2018,"Singapore to Bangkok. Soon after take-off, a passenger went to a vacant seat located at the emergency exit (13F) for additional comfort. A Scoot cabin staff went to ask her politely to return to her designated seat and the passenger did. The staff deserves praise to approach the passenger because allowing her to continue seating at the emergency would have compromised safety in case of an unexpected incident as the passenger was not briefed on how to operate the exit door prior to takeoff.  Keep up the good work Scoot.",0
2018,"Singapore to Hong Kong. Terrible overall experience. Every possible excuse to charge you for things that are normally part of the ticket: its not low cost at all, and with petty rules about anything that can be charged for (check the weight of your carry on bags before you leave home!), ground staff who act like they get a percentage of any extra revenue they charge you for and no managerial presence to smooth anything over. The staff on board are fine, the food (don't buy it) is awful, the seats are tiny, i'm not that tall (under 6ft) but couldn't fit my legs in without spreading into the aisle, very uncomfortable journey. They say they are low cost, but if you have been scalped for all the extras, they are not cheap all. I do this trip roughly every month, have used pretty much all the airlines who fly it, and I wont use Scoot again.",1
2018,"I flew with Scoot earlier this month from Lucknow to Singapore (TR501). I wanted to call out the excellent service that was provided to not just me, but to multiple passengers on this flight by one of the crew. This must have been a difficult flight to manage with lots of seniors and babies on board but the attitude displayed by one female FA was remarkable. She  put the parents at ease and handled the situation in a most kind and professional manner. She also made it a point to talk to children on the flight and picked them up and took them for little walks whenever she saw the parent looking tired or the child looking restless. I must also mention, how she sternly told off a few difficult passengers who violated the policy of eating outside food, but did not across as rude or harsh. Big fan of what I saw that day. Hands down, the best cabin manager I have seen in action.",0
2018,"Taipei to Singapore. My scheduled flight was 2.05 pm and we reached the check-in counter at 1.10pm and  were told that check-in closes at 1.05pm (an hour before flight). The customer service kept saying to buy a new ticket.  It was just a 5 mins difference and we had to purchase a new flight ticket. I find this really ridiculous as the airline had a policy of check-in closed an hour before flight. This policy does not reflect in the scoot app. The policy only reflects on the invoice sent via to email. When I asked if they had seats left for the next upcoming flight, they told me to purchase the ticket online. This 5 mins later cost me $375SGD per person. When I sent an email regarding about this issue, they did not address to my question or provide a solution. Their reply: We refer to your feedback received on 19 January 2018 through our Customer Support Portal. As part of our efforts to maintain on-time flight departure, we adhere closely to our check-in counter closure times. Our check-in counters open 3 hours before departure time and closes at 1 hour prior to scheduled departure. We note your feedback on our airport check-in staff/handling. This will be shared with the relevant airport teams for their review for us to further improve our services. Nevertheless, passengers who showed up after the check-in counter closure time will not be accepted for the flight and our tickets are non-refundable in nature.",1
2018,"Singapore to Perth. What a disgrace. We rock up to the airport for the 14th and last flight of a round the world trip. We booked lounge access and Scoot in silence as a treat to cap off our 5 week holiday. We find that our flight was not on the screen so go to the service desk. The lady says that the flight is still on and to head to the appropriate gate. As we were walking away we are called back to be told that the Scoot flight has been cancelled and Scoot has tendered a Singapore Airlines plane but there would be no refreshments or entertainment offered. On top of that we lost our lounge access and Scoot in silence. About a week after we got home I find out that there has been fraudulent activity carried out with my credit card in India, one of our stops around the world. I had to get a new card. I then started the process to get my money refunded from Scoot and that has continued to this day (5 months later). They will not accept my new card details which has been provided in the form of an official letter from my bank. They are thieves and will not accept that they have stuffed us around no end. I will never fly with them again.",1
2018,"Sydney to Singapore. Utterly appalling! I know it is a budget airline, but there's no excuse for getting the basics wrong. Flying out of Sydney to Singapore on Dec 29th, the check-in queue was the longest I have seen one in my life - it went past the barriers and all the way down the public area to almost the next main exit. Apparently they had delayed a flight the night before and it was now leaving about the same time as ours 1.30pm / 3pm no problem, that happens. But in this case, they know exactly how many people are going to be arriving, and when, and there were so few staff checking people in it was ridiculous. I barely moved for 30 mins (in the queue where the check-in counters were so far away I couldn't even see them) and was now less than hr from take -off. The let me skip the q but they should have had people separating the queue into the 1.30 and 3pm flights from the outset. A text message to flyers saying to expect delays at check in and arrive earlier would have also been a no-brainer. On the flight itself, it took nearly 2 hours for the drink carton to come around, by which stage a man at the back was dehydrated and distressed. The menu in the pocket related also to a different flight. I travel by budget airlines frequently but will never fly Scoot again.",1
2018,"Singapore to Sydney. I am a regular Scoot customer but unfortunately I had on numerous occasions been tricked by the Scoot website unaware of the not very clear and not very straight forward system into paying extras. On my last Oct flight, while I unticked the box of not buying insurance, it somehow was ticked at the final page and I had to pay the extra for the travel insurance which I had already taken up with another company. I just let this pass because it was not a lot of money. On my recent trip in Jan 2018, I booked my ticket to Taipei on 22 Dec and decided to add a check-in luggage on 24 Dec. I had went on the site to manage booking and add luggage and thought it went through and while it was Christmas eve, I had little time to follow up with email. On the 9 Jan 2017 I arrived at Tao Yuen airport and put my check-in luggage and was told I did not buy any and was to pay NTW3660 for a 17kg luggage. I wish to advise those who are not very computer savvy to be very careful when booking online with Scoot, you need to double check very careful each step you tick or enter, they will suck your money and no reasoning. I had many other occasions paid for chosen seat but being allocated another at the airport. You need to take screen shots on every step or they will trick your money. At the end of the day, the fare will come to about the same as a full fare airline so why chose Scoot.",1
2018,Singapore to Langkawi. Scoot is one of the worst airline I have travelled in. The staff is highly unprofessional and at checkin the way staff talk to customers is derogatory. You get a feeling like as if you are flying for free and Scoot is doing you a favour to you by letting you fly with them. Even after complaining to manager about the unprofessional staff there was not a single word of apology or regret from them. This airline spoiled my mood during my holiday. Also at the cost of this airline you can get air Asia or even better airline.,1
2018,"Athens to Singapore. Cabin crew service was excellent despite being  busy. They are kind, sincere and polite, and do their best to meet the customers' requests. The flight I was on from Athens to Singapore was a full flight and the staff was really busy trying to seat all the passengers. Despite that, they are very attentive and are careful not to neglect our requests.",0
2018,"Sydney to Singapore. Planned flight: 14th December 2017 at 10 pm. Actual take off: 15 December at 2 pm The worst budget airline. The flight got cancelled. It was announced at the gate few minutes before the boarding time. We had another connecting flight from Singapore to Sri Lanka. However, we were informed that we would be given another flight next day early morning. So we were forced to collect our luggage and return home.Since we had a connecting flight, wehad to pay another 900 aud to reschedule the flight to Sri Lanka. When we returned  next morning to Sydney airport, we were informed the Scoot flight got delayed by 2 hours. Ok fine, still we had a hope that we could catch the rescheduled flight to Sri Lanka. However, finally the Scoot flight got further delayed and it left Sydney at 2 pm on 15 December. When we arrived Singapore, our (rescheduled) SriLankan airline flight has left and we had to book another flight to Sri Lanka by paying another 500 AUD which leaves next day morning. Finally, we arrived Sri lanka exactly one day later the scheduled arrival and paying more than 1500 aud extra for tickets and taxi. It was a horrible experience and like a nightmare to us. The ground staff at Sydney airport do not even know how to handle such issues. They were unprofessional and appalling. One staff member laughed at us when we asked for compensation for the connecting flight rescheduling cost, and the manager even threatened my husband saying she would not board us if we do not stop complaining. Overall experience was unspeakably awful.",1
2017,"Manila to Singapore, booked to travel in January 2018. Customer service does not exist. I've been trying to call the customer service in Singapore, Philippines, Australia, and any countries I can try. No one picks up. Every time I get a classic machine voice that everyone is on the phone (on several occasions!). I tried sending a feedback through their online form. I tried to complete every single field, and by the time i click on ""submit"" it says that I have not entered on the ""Case Category / Type Field.",1
2017,"I have flown quite a number of budget airlines in Asia and Scoot is by far the worst and most unprofessional one. Our flight from Singapore to Kochi was delayed for 1 hour and the pilot neither acknowledged the delay nor offered an apology. Crew members were untrained, rude, and had extremely poor language skills. The return journey from Kochi to Singapore, only upon asking at check in desk we were told that the plane was delayed for an hour. But we were puzzled to see that the original departure time was printed on the boarding pass. Nowhere else in the airport or at the departure gate was there an indication or announcement of the delay. Upon tracking the flight status of the incoming plane we realized that the flight was delayed for at least 2 hours, and passengers were not promptly updated. At the end of the flight, again there was no acknowledgement of the 2 hr delay nor an apology. When we feedback to the crew member she just drew a blank poker face and did not bother to respond. It was appaling to see a budget carrier associated with Singapore Airlines go so low in service standards. Definitely never flying Scoot again.",1
2017,"Singapore to Ipoh. Flew Scoot simply because of timing and no major full service airlines served this route. The plane was old, but they flew on time, the return flight was earlier. As this is a budget airline, I didnt expect much. Food and drinks are only available at a price and the seat pitch was as how budget airlines usually go. What was most troublesome was the passengers. The moment the seatbelt light was off, the pushing and shoving begins. Everyone tried to get hold of their luggage. This seemingly old gentle man stepped on my foot twice, pushed and shoved me and others to get to his suitcase two rows away. When he was done I faced him and told him you dont need to push and shove you know, you could just ask and he pretended he didnt understand English. If you can, just check in your luggage. The passengers always bring a lot of carry on and the odds of finding a space above your seat is slim.",0
2017,"Perth to Singapore. Extremely bad service regarding infants onboard, even for a low budget airline. Not only was there no priority boarding which is common for most airlines in the world but we werent even allowed to stand by boarding desk. Had to take all our things and stand by another gate!",1
2017,"Melbourne to Amritsar via Singapore booked for January 2018. Worst airline ever! If there were negative points I could give them, I would. Appalling customer service, incompetent staff on ground and in the cabin. They lost my luggage to being with and ruined the first week of my holiday. Despite booking Scootbiz and having flexibility in my ticket, when I enquired to change my flight to leave early, they quoted me USD 550 to change my ticket. This is after I paid USD 799 for my ticket. When I go to book a fresh ticket with the same extras etc, the new ticket is USD 794. How does this work! How are they even allowed to operate in the Australian market?",1
2017,"Athens to Singapore. Experience was okay. Although 11 hours on a budget flight was a bit too much for me. No one checked our carry-on luggage when we checked in at the counter and at the gate, nor cared when we ate outside food on the flight. A guy we recently met had 3 bags due to finding a sleeping bag at a festival but he wasn't told he was over the luggage limit and brought it on the flight. My boyfriend experienced a problem when his boarding pass was scanned. Apparently his seat number got changed after check-in and was moved from a window seat to an aisle seat. Because all the seats in my row were occupied, I couldn't get much sleep or relaxation during the 11 hour flight. Luckily when we arrived in Changi Airport, where we could sleep at a snooze lounge at 5am. Also, the flight attendant call button is located at the handrest area so people kept accidentally pushing it.",0
2017,"My wife and I was to have flown from Singapore to Taipei on 10 Dec in Scootbiz but we could not as my wife had a road accident in October. I contacted the airline to cancel the booking and to get back a refund (even if partial). But instead of a partial refund, I was given a run-around with one-way emails from Scoot asking for letter from doctor stating she could not travel (which I obtained) but in the end Scoot says go claim from your insurance! What a waste of time doing all that and calling the call centre (put on hold many times)! And I requested refund way back in Oct when the flight was in Dec. And in the end I found out they sold my already paid seats - what unscrupulous greed!",1
2017,"Jakarta to Singapore. A Scoot stewardess acted so condescending. Flight departed a bit delayed, I had an urgent appointment right after the flight, hence when my carry-on baggage was placed in a row behind me I wasn't happy because if my baggage was behind me then when disembarking I had to wait for all other passengers to go before me. If my baggage is located at any row in front of me, during disembarking I could follow the flow of movement of other passengers. I explained this to her, asking either one of these, I to move to any seat behind the row where my luggage was located, or my baggage to be moved to any free space in the compartment at any row in front of me. She said, ""there's nothing I can do"" and she pointed out that it's not her job to move my bag. What kind of attitude she had. To me, fly Scoot last.",1
2017,"Singapore to Sapporo via Taipei. This is the worst Airline in terms of service level at the ticketing and pre-boarding service. It is the most opportunistic airline that charges absurdly for the slightest change. I kept getting cut-off in my attempt to call and under the pretext or excuse that the manager's name dealing with my case has to be kept a secret, I could never identify the person whom I am supposed to talk to. Scoot had allowed me to change the passenger for the air ticket that I bought for my daughter. But due to unforeseen circumstances, she cannot join us in our family trip. I had to transfer the ticket to my niece. However, during the several telephone conversation, I have been told that the change fee is between S$80-S$100. However, when I tried to make the change online, I was told it would cost me $400, almost the price of the ticket itself! Plus there would also be a fare difference charge when there is no fare change, no change in date or time or selling away my existing ticket and rebuying another! The $400 change fee comprises S$100 for change of first name, another $100 for change of last name, multiply that by 2 for the return ticket! This is the most absurd charge and the airline refused to budge telling me its in their rule!. Firstly, the rule is absurd and secondly, during all the telephone exchanges, I have only been told it is between S$80-$100 and never $400! The discussion has been going on for 2 weeks now, but there has been no resolution. I feel that I have been held to ransom as I am due to depart in slightly more than a week. I have been using Scoot alot recently. But customer service, goodwill and ethical practice obviously has no place in Scoot's management! I will think doubly hard about ever using Scoot again. I had expected that its afiliation to SIA would count in ensuring a certain service level! I also thought my being a Krysfliier member would also be factored in their dealing of this matter. But obviously it does not!",1
2017,"Our first sector was Sydney-Singapore to meet up with our cruise. The supposedly new aircraft looked like a tired old wreck. The carpet was so badly worn. The cabin crew were aloof, and not that approachable. They have a 'no you cannot eat, drink any food-la but ours"" policy. One lady next to me opened a small bag of chips when one female attendant came and told her 'no eating own food, not allowed so put away'. The food we had paid for was bad. I understand about keeping prices down but what we got served up was so bad. No coffee/tea for that sector but you could buy soft drinks. You were charged for everything - Blankets, food, water. The flight home was even worse. An after midnight take off, freezing cabin (if your cold you buy blanket,  only $10.) Passengers complained about cabin temperature (no can fix-la) and off they would walk.",1
2017,"Singapore to Krabi. Essentially we had missed the time for check in and based on airport and airline procedure we would have been unable to board. One of Scoots on ground staff however went out of her way to help us with this, calling the flight captain who kindly agreed to open the counter for us. They went out of their way and were empowered to do so, and in so doing provided us a superior customer experience. A big thank you to both of them and shout out for the exemplary customer service.",0
2017,"Cebu to Melbourne via Singapore. The good thing about this flight is that you fly the Boeing 787 which is a comfortable plane. There are however lots of downsides flying Scoot:  no in seat power, despite this being common on the B787 - seats are extremely narrow, especially the window seat. Scoot charges a ridiculous booking fee per person per flight, which they hide during the booking process - airport tax in Cebu (php 750) is not included in your ticket and has to be paid separately, I find this extremely deceiving - if you add everything up they are not cheap at all.",1
2017,"Singapore to Penang. Scoot lost me in their systems and put me through queue after queue till the point where the system shut out my ticket and i was forced with the most condescending service to buy another ticket under the guise of an admin fee, its incredible how terrible Scoots service has become since merging with Tigerair and its the most contempt i have ever witnessed by service staff. Not only myself but i am surrounded by passengers with the same issues raging all around me as the service counter queues continue to stretch out.",1
2017,"Bangkok to Singapore. Most horrible airline ever. Reached the boarding gate 5 minutes late and the staff was unhelpful in trying to help me check in and argued with me about being 5 minutes late. I must admit I was at fault for being late, I felt that the staff made no effort to help and was rude. Lousy service. Definitely not book a scoot flight again.",1
2017,Flew Gold Coast to Singapore with Scoot. Was fine. I'm 6'2 (188cm) plenty of leg room. I read so many bad reviews here - people complain about not having what they didn't pay for. This is a good no frills flight on a modern plane and its run well. For the price I highly recommend it. Can't comment on the food.,0
2017,"Tokyo Narita to Bangkok. ScootBiz is not worth the money. Your bag does not get a ScootBiz label. Therefore your bag doesn't come first. I had to wait for offloading almost to the end - ScootBiz has no own exit from the plane. You have to go back through economy class to get out. What a hassle - seat is not flatbed and has small recline only. It was uncomfortable, I got back pain. No blanket, no pillows are provided - you can only close the blinds electronically 1 hour after take off. Enjoy the sun in your eyes for the first hour. I didn't know you need to download an app before getting on board: I missed the movies - the cutlery is plastic and such bad quality.",1
2017,"Bali to Chennai via Singapore. On check in I was informed that I have to pay 320,000 rupees more. No explanation as per why, and when I insisted that I have paid everything needed to my travel agent when I booked the flight, I was simply told that if I don't pay this extra money I won't be allowed to go on the flight. So I did pay it, and asked for the IATA reclamation form. The person in charge didn't know what a reclamation form is, let alone have it. On the first flight I think I understood what has happened. A very impolite flight attendant served a meal saying that I have ordered a meal. I haven't actually, and if I had decided to buy it on the plane, 2 meals (for 2 flights) would have cost 100,000 and not 320,000 rupees. What must have happened is that my travel agent wrote on all the tickets I have reserved that I am vegetarian, and Scoot interpreted it as if I have ordered a meal.",1
2017,"Singapore to Phuket in 2018. I wanted to book a flight for my wife, my daughter (1 year old) and myself but was not able to book a seat for my daughter online. So I called Scoot, they told me to just book a ticket for my wife and me and add our daughter to our tickets, and after booking I would need to call Scoot again to request for a seat for our daughter. It turned out when I called to confirm the seat that I had to pay the adult seat rate to get a seat for my daughter after already paying for the infant fee of 75SGD! So eventually I paid almost the double fee for my daughter than I had to pay for our own tickets! It is a ridiculous policy of which I still can't believe that they even dare to request this! With most airlines you fly for free with an infant but when you want to have a seat you pay a normal rate but with Scoot you have to pay double the normal rate!",1
2017,Singapore to Bangalore. Worst experience flying with Scoot. Was not allowed to put my cabin luggage in the compartment above the seats and the air hostess was rude. I had to fly with my legs folded throughout the journey. Never flying again with Scoot.,1
2017,"Singapore to Kalibo via Cebu. We are utterly disappointed with the service and food options on our flight from Singapore to Kalibo and Kalibo back to Singapore! While we were flying to Kalibo, we have ordered some food on Scoots menu but we were informed rudely by the cabin crew that it was out of stock. And when we return back to Singapore after four nights, the same food choice was out of stock again. When we asked the crew why is that so and he said that it was due to the food choice being only available on flights from Singapore to Kalibo - which is blatant lie! - because we flew the exact said route four nights ago and were told that it was out of stock. Disappointed! You guys at Scoot need to renew the on-flight menu and educate your crew members!",1
2017,"Singapore to Melbourne. Absolutely disgusted to find that our seats 1A and 1C, that were booked in February, had been changed to 3A and 3C. Complained at the desk in Singapore who just stalled for time until our flight was called. Advised that at boarding gate they will assist us, of course they can't help, as seats were already taken. On our return to Melbourne I complained and was advised that I was sent an email in July regarding a merge with Tiger. Although our flight, date and time did not change apparently our seats did, which we weren't aware of. They mentioned something about an upgrade at Singapore and after reading the review of 12 August, it appears our seats we booked were sold to a higher bidder. My advice fly Scoot but don't expect seats you book and pay for. Scoot are unapologetic and ground staff, either ignore you or use other time wasting tactics until flight is called.",1
2017,"Flew Scoot from Taipei to Tokyo. I thought since this is a cheap airline, the service would be horrible. However, it's not the case at all. I was lucky to have pre-selected my seat and paid a fee to sit in the silent zone. There were actually parents with small children taking the same flight (leaving 6.40am) I was shocked. What are the parents thinking?? I highly recommend the passengers to pay for the silent zone seats if you are annoyed by screaming kids easily. In general, a pleasant experience.",0
2017,"Bangkok to Kansai. Due to the fact that I was in a tour group, I couldnt choose the airline I was flying. I wanted to fly Thai Airways, however that wasnt possible. On a timeline scale, I reserved an extra ticket for my Mum in business, as it was on sale at the time. It was only $200 on the first sector, so we brought it. It would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. Initially, I asked for an exit row, and got the best seat, 4J and 4H. However, the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. Once I got on board, the flight attendant at the door greets you,  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. I call the purser, and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. They then say that this was a double seat assignment and that I had to sit in row 15. The seat itself isnt appealing, and some short haul aircraft have better seats. I couldve paid extra for seats with extra legroom, but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in, and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. Luckily, the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. But the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse! The most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call button/light switch, awkwardly placed on the armrest. I understand the 787 doesnt have call buttons on the ceiling, but cant you find a better place for it? After takeoff, I order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. The lasagne tasted unappetising, while the pasta tasted really bland. A little bit later in the flight, I had Ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. All this food set me back 50 Singaporean dollars. The equivalent amount of food on AirAsia would only cost me a third as much, and also tastes better.  On the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, the staff at the check in were friendly like Japanese people are, and I requested an extra legroom seat, and found out I wouldnt be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. However, my brother wasnt allowed to sit there, so we asked if he was allowed to sit in The ScootInSilence zone, which he wasnt allowed to, even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. There was a lady and her daughter talking in Japanese in the counter next to us, and later in the flight, I saw her and her daughter (who looked like she was 10) sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if I had a language barrier, even though the guy at the counter wasnt Japanese. The crew on this flight were much more friendly, but still considerably cold. I went to have some conversation in the galley, and after 2 minutes of pleasant conversation they all had their backs turned on me. Scoot is a horrible choice and I would pay much more in order to be able to avoid it. Not worth the $500 I paid round trip.",1
2017,"Singapore to Melbourne return. I took Scoot on a return flight from SIN to MEL and back The departure time was 1:15AM and at 630AM MEL time (or 4:30AM SG time), I was awaken because they were serving the Premium Meal that I ordered.  My Premium Meal breakfast came with Haagen Dazs ice-cream. At 630AM? While serving me Premium Meal, the stewardess was stacking more than 1 meal on the tray and knocked a container of salad from the tray. It fell in between passengers seat. Luckily my meal was served.  The stewardess (while still holding a tray of meal - minus the salad) was on her knees trying to locate the dropped salad. She then get another stewardess to help while still holding the tray of food. And when it was time to serve food to the rest of the passengers, the cart carrying food was being emptied and so a stewardess asked another stewardess to bring extra food to re-fill the card. The air steward bought 3 trays of food and simply just place it on the floor on the aisle. The tray of food was on the floor for a full 5-min before it was placed into the cart. Seriously?  Food is terrible. Why can't I order more than 1 meal per flight? This is an 8-hour flight! Please learn from AirAsia X to see how this can be done. Cabin temperature is too hot. I was sweating on both flights",1
2017,"Singapore to Bangkok. Started boarding and while in the airbridge next to the plane door the captain orders the closure of the hatch in order to perform an engine trial run. The passengers have to wait standing in the small corridor for this procedure for about 20 minutes. At entering is clear that the plane has not been cleaned from previous flight, there are papers on the floor and there is some food leftovers on the seats. Plane smells not being properly air conditioned, the seatsleg space is bellow the acceptable minimal and when the passenger in front of me reclines the seat it smashes my knees. Given the price its definitely not worthy since there are many alternative flights cheaper that offer better leg room and also better service and better food. I would definitely not fly them again.",1
2017,"Singapore to Sydney. At the gate we were handed photocopied pages of what was not available on board. By this stage we couldn't buy any food or drink. This was a Scoot flight operated on a Singapore Airlines plane, with a Singapore Airlines crew and flight code. Someone at Scoot thought it cheaper to pay for only the wet lease of the aircraft and not provide any services, drinks, or food. There were no soft drinks for the whole flight. No alcohol. No wifi. No IFE. We were offered a small packet of peanuts and a glass of orange juice for the first five hours. And nothing else. No movies, music or no magazines.  After five and a half hours breakfast was served. Beware if you're tossed onto one of these 'cargo' flights, it's a long flight if you can't sleep, nor watch a movie, nor listen to music, have a snack, soft drink or a beer or glass of wine. Take your own food.",1
2017,"Singapore to Perth. First time trying on Scoot. The seat space for Scoot is small and there does not provide any in-flight entertainment. i understand that as it is Singapore budget air. However, in this 5 hours flight, the temperature in flight is about 28-30 as it gets a bit suffocate, thus, create a great discomfort. other than that, this is what expected for a budget air.",0
2017,"Firstly, just as any budget airline, Scoot charges high fees for necessities, such as bag fee of $40 USD and seat selection fee $14 USD. Once on my 6-hour flight from Bangkok to Tokyo - they wouldn't even provide water to passengers without a fee. It was $4 USD for a bottle of water - something that should be provided for free as a human right on any flight. Thus, I find it highly inhumane that the airline will try to make profit on such simple things. I asked for a blanket (as it was an overnight flight) and was told I'd have to pay for that as well - although most long-distance flights will provide them for free. Secondly, I asked the staff if I could move to an empty row in front of my (empty row) seat for more leg room - only to be informed that I would need to pay more. Later I witnessed a few of Scoot flight attendants take up the whole row that I asked to moved to in order to take naps (as it was an overnight flight). I disembarked this flight with a very poor impression of Scoot airline and will never use them again. I recommend using proper (not budget) airlines, as the cost comes at to be the same.",1
2017,"Perth to Athens via Singapore. I booked a flight with Scoot in Dec 2016, leaving on 3rd September. A month or so later I received an email from Scoot advising the flight had been changed to 1st Sept, I changed my plans accordingly. Six weeks or so prior to flying I was advised Scoot was in partnership with Tigerair. I arrived in Perth on the Friday, caught up with some mates and arrived at perth Airport around 3pm by Taxi expecting my flight to depart at 6.15pm. I was advised that the flight had been delayed until around 22.15pm and therefore I would miss my connecting flight to Athens and I was to report to terminal 5 at Singapore airport upon arrival. I returned around 8pm, the departurs board revealed scoot at been delayed until 0230am - I hung around until 0130 and decided to not get this flight. I checked the Scoot flights going out of Singapore to Athens and it revealed I would have to wait several days to obtain a connecting flight. I am pleased I never got on the flight and had sufficient money to make alternative plans.",1
2017,"Athens to Singapore. Be very careful of what you pay them. I paid extra EUR90 to upgrade the seat. Days later, I accidentally downgraded my seat to a EUR20 one. I wanted to change my seat back. So I called. I was told that the difference of EUR70 is not refundable and I need to pay another EUR90 to get my original seat back, because it's their policy. What a ""nice"" policy to make sure that they keep everything that's in their pocket even if it doesn't belong to them. The first time flying with them, also the last.",1
2017,"When flying from anywhere else to Singapore, there is no online check-in or boarding pass. I flew into BKK on a separate itinerary and stayed at the (expensive) hotel inside of the airport security zone. Thanks to Scoot's lack of online check-in I had to spend hours going out through immigration and back through security so I could check-in at their only counter at 5am. Please be aware the you will not be able to stay in the secure area if you are using Scoot as a second leg of a separate itinerary on the way to Singapore. I will not be flying with Scoot again until they have a modern online check-in system, there is no excuse for this in 2017.",1
2017,"Flew Scoot from Male, Maldives to Singapore. Check in was a breeze. No line since we were so early. Friendly agents and quick passage through security and immigration. Walked on tarmac to gate so got to take a few pictures of the aircraft as well as others lined up next to our plane. Flight attendants all kind, smiling, polished and impeccable. Very consistent cabin announcements and service. All coach configuration with black leather seats. Everything is buy on board, including water. The food that was preordered smelled fantastic when served! Made me wish I ordered something. Cabin crew all friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend as the fare for an international 4.5 hr round trip flight was only about $300.",0
2017,"Kaohsiung to Singapore. We would like to thank the captain and cabin crew of TR287 on 19 Aug that they provided assistance to my husband who was not feeling well after landing. Cabin crew attended to us promptly. They provided him with blanket and water to keep him warm and secured him on a wheelchair in order to transfer him out from the aircraft to the airport terminal. The captain and crew even helped to carry my luggages all the way.  Without their kind help and teamwork, we couldn't be able to arrive home safely. We're very touched by thier kind concerns and professional assistance! Thank you.",0
2017,"Took a business class from Singapore to Athens return. We booked our flights pretty early, couple of months ago prior to the flight and booked our seats for the flight. Paid about SGD 2.2k per person. From Singapore to Athens, the quality of service and the standard of the service was way below par. The air stewardesses do not know what they were doing, some told us that we could have free flow water, some then told us that actually they do not serve water unless we purchase. Thereafter when it came to meal time, the stewardesses were clearly unsure of what was on the menu, i.e. we were offered the choices of pumpkin or turkey wrap, but actually, it was a pumpkin and turkey wrap. As it was an overnight flight, we were woken up 4 hours before the arrival for our meals, which was a little annoying for some of us whom have given them instructions that we didnt want our meals. From Athens to Singapore, during check in, we realised that our first row seats were given away to customers who did a 150euro upgrade. It was unprofessional of this airline as we booked our seats way in advance, paid much more for our business class seats, and the walk-in customers whom came by the counters, decided to pay for the upgrade with simply 150 euro, and yet they could take our seats which we have chosen beforehand. And we can all foresee, the counter staff, ground staff etc all said they cant do anything about it. We sent in a feedback to Scoot and as we can all expect it, there wasnt any response from them. We met another passenger who also told us that Scoot just cancelled his flight. Word of advice: If you really have to travel via business class seats, choose the first row as the rows 2 and 3 are not worth the heavy price tag. There wasn't any certainty and your seats can be given away to others.",1
2017,"Penang to Singapore. I was literally screamed at by a cabin attendant when I wanted to take a general cabin view picture during boarding (I grudgingly complied). With other airlines it's an ok thing so long as you don't take pictures of cabin crew, which is the regulation in Europe. But why do they have to be so rude towards someone who just wants to document his flight experience? My flight departed Penang late which resulted in a late arrival in Singapore. No Scoot WiFi on these planes. Probably the only plus point was the ground staff in Penang who were polite. So although the seat pitch and comfort was acceptable on this flight and the price was amazing, the service was under par.",1
2017,"Singapore to Penang. Almost non-existent customer service. Had a delay of nearly 12 hours for my flight from Melbourne to Singapore. All I received was an email sent the night before informing us of the delay for our morning flight the next day. Reason given in email for the delay was due to ""operational constraint"" which was rejected by my insurance. I understand from the cabin crew that the delay is due to technical issues but customer service staff refuses to provide a proper report hence I am unable to claim my insurance for the delay. Got a $50 voucher from Scoot for the delay, used it to book another scoot flight and was charged an additional mystery charge. Called and found out it was wrongly charged yet they refused to refund. When pushed further, the service staff insist that I upgrade my seat and use the amount to offset the difference and make additional payment on the balance. Mistake on their side but customer to bear the costs?",1
2017,"Singapore to Hong Kong. I bought business in May 2016 but Scoot cancel the route and change Tiger to operate and downgrade me to economy. All the business luggage and meal disappeared, just refund a little. I complaint to ask for better seat arrangement and free luggage to compensation. They change my request to 1st row seat & 30kg luggage but charge me.  I complained times to cancel the request, I said if I need to pay, I won't take it, ask them to revise me back for normal seat. However, their CS didn't amend, even on my travel day morning, I ask and ask in channel but no one revise for me. At counter, I refuse the first row, they assigned another row for me. Therefore, I ask for refund after my trip. However, I trace and ask, ask and trace million times, they didn't refund. Even until now, they still no refund.",1
2017,"Athens to Sydney via Singapore. Decent flights and seats but a few issues that left us all a bit disappointed. Their policy of charging over S$10/L for drinking water and refusing to provide any for free (even on an 11 hour flight) means their staff are constantly dealing with upset customers and are frequently grumpy as a result. As others have pointed out the call buttons are poorly places and set off constantly by people leaning on their armrests - the cabin staff mostly just ignore them. The menu was unimpressive, especially for an airline based out of SIN, and the hot meals (S$12) were tiny. The seat belt signs were on for more than half of our first two flights, with no turbulence, and with most passengers and the just ignoring them. On the whole feels even more budget than AirAsia / AirAsiaX or Jetstar, but a decent choice for the money if they're flying where you're going.",0
2017,"Singapore to Athens. While Scoot economy is quite good value for money, the biz section is totally the opposite. Besides the friendly crew and larger but uncomfortable seat, the rest was not there. Food and drinks are very limited and below par to any comparison. My WiFi and entertainment didn't work on both directions. ""Sorry about this"" was the reply when brought up to flight crew. Someone behind me gave them a 30 mins earful regarding same issues so I opted not to do the same and honor their politeness with just mentioning my concerns. Overhaul, Scoot biz not worth it. I would get better outcome on premium economy somewhere else. Their economy is not bad considering the price range.",1
2017,"A better experience on Scoot than my trip with Singapore Airlines. The plane is quite new and has excellent facilities. The seats, cabin and toilets are clean. Scoot crew somehow provide better service than my Singapore Airlines flight. I had a great experience flying Scoot despite being no frills.",0
2017,"Singapore to Hong Kong. Scoot is a decent airline for the ticket price that I paid. Online check-in was simple to use although I have no idea why there is a need for a further document check at the airport when I was eligible for straight-to-gate. Boarding was orderly and the flight departed Singapore on time. My assigned seat was comfortable and legroom was good. Cabin crew were also generally good although they didn't really smile very often and they generally left passengers alone. Unlike AirAsia Scoot charges for inflight WiFi streaming entertainment and I thought that was not worth it. The onboard menu wasn't so impressive and food was generally expensive. The flight arrived in Hong Kong early so that's a plus point in my book. I was not really happy with the placement of the attendant call buttons on the armrest - during the entire flight I could hear many instances of passengers accidentally pressing the buttons (myself included). All in all I'd be happy to give Scoot another try again, but until they fix that annoying call button and provide free inflight entertainment I would not look to them for long-haul flights.",0
2017,"Bangkok to Singapore on 9 June and Singapore to Bangkok on 18 June. Both flights with Scoot departed on time. Check-in at the counter in DMK had about 20-25 passengers in the queue at about 2 hours before departure. The queue moved quickly. Similar experience with check-in at SIN. Kudos to Scoot for having sufficient counters to handle check-in traffic. A quick glance at nearby counters for other carriers including full-service carriers tell a different tale; long queues of 80 passengers or more is common. The flight from BKK to SIN originated from Japan with a stopover in BKK. The flight from BKK to SIN continues to Japan. This being a B787-8, the cabin feels spacious and clean. Cabin crew provided clear announcements in English. Announcements were also made in Japanese. Cabin crew was friendly and had constant presence in the cabin. They were fastidious with safety checks before departure and arrival. What impressed me was the seats which had good recline comparable with full service carriers and the sufficient space in the overhead cabins despite the flights being full. Seats at other LCCs covering this route could barely recline.",0
2017,"Flew Bangkok DMK to Tokyo NRT. Scoot is the SG low cost carrier but travelling in Scoot Business gives you pretty much a full service carrier experience. Priority check-in at the airport, but no priority security or lounge access, free checked bag, meal on board, etc. Check-in at the airport was quick and efficient and DMK is not the busiest airport in the world so both immigration and security were quick. We arrived after boarding had started but given that we had ""board me first"" status we were actively sought out by the gate staff and whisked around the boarding queue. Seats in Scoot business are very much like the seats found in premium economy on most airlines, so 22 inch wide with 8 inch recline. They are very comfortable. There is no IFE but WiFi and a streaming service is provided free of charge in business. A hot meal is included in the price which can be either pre-booked or ordered once on board. After boarding we were given the choice of having our meal straight away or prior to landing. Everything else not pre-booked is charged for at reasonable prices. The crew were very warm and friendly and seemed genuinely eager to please. Given the excellent price point Scoot is highly recommended for 5-6 hour flights such as this one.",0
2017,"As of June 19, there is no online check in (even if you have only carry on or no baggage at all) so the only way to get check in and have your boarding pass is to have to stand in a very long line to get your boarding pass. I lined up before the counter opened and it took me an hour to reach the counter. The ground staff will allocate your seat on a first come, first serve basis so if you want a seat at the front without paying make sure you line up at least an hour before the counter opens (which is opens 3 hours before departure). Flight was on time and we even arrived 20 minutes early. There is no TV at the seat and no big TV to show you the map, so it's very boring as you don't know where you are and when you will reach your destination. The aircraft was hot, I was sweating so if you have a connecting flight after Scoot, would recommend to take a shower at Ambassador Hotel Transit (you don't have to go through immigration, the hotel is located near the gates in terminal 2&3) for 16$. Yes they are very strict about carry on and checked bag weight. They will weigh your carry on at the check-in counter (it's should be under 10 kg). But they won't re-check the weight at the terminal. Wifi wasn't working On my flight. Overall it's an ok airline.",0
2017,"My wife and I flew from Perth to Japan with Scoot in Feb 2017. We booked with Scoot as they had convenient flights to our destination and flew through Singapore Changi Airport (No.1 in the world according to us). We were flying Scoot Biz there and back, mainly for my wife's comfort. My wife has mobility problems, so we advised Scoot that we'd need Special Assistance at each airport we used (5 in all). Being that Scoot is a Low Cost Carrier, I was a bit dubious that they'd be reliable in actioning this request, but I'm very pleased to report that not only did they give us Special Assistance at every stage, but I'd have to say it was brilliant Special Assistance. Whether it was at the airport, where the service is provided by a contract company, or in the air, the service was nothing short of exceptional. I'd like to make special mention of the cabin staff on all of our flights. The girls in the cabin (no boys on our flights that I saw), were absolutely wonderful. My wife only had to blink and they sprang to her aid, helping her getting on and off the aircraft, as well as being continually attentive on board. I couldn't fault their service ethic and they were genuinely happy to help her, whenever she needed it. Operationally, every flight was ontime and their Dreamliners were beautiful aircraft to fly in. Just prior to our return to Australia, one of their Dreamliners was hit and damaged by another aircraft, in a ground handling incident at Changi. I thought that this may lead to delays on our flights, as I'm sure they fully use their 12 aircraft, but it had no obvious effect for us. Scoot was world class and any full service airline wouldn't have been able to do more for us than Scoot did. My wife and I were very satisfied with all aspects of Scoot's service and will definitely continue to use them and will encourage others we come into contact with, to do likewise. Extremely well done Scoot!",0
2017,"Flew from Melbourne to Singapore. Scoot are the budget of the budget. The staff are unfriendly and incompetent. The plane we took had the least legroom of a plane I've ever been on and being 187cm I was in serious discomfort/pain the whole flight. They do not have drinking water available (except to buy at extortionate prices) and even told us ""no outside food can be eaten on the plane"". This isn't written down anywhere and I'm not sure that's even legal? Avoid.",1
2017,"Singapore to Hong Kong. The flight experience wowed me. This was only the second week that Scoot was taking over this route (previously,it was operated by Tiger Air A320), and I was highly anticipating my journey, especially given the aircraft, a Boeing 787. This inflight experience was on par of that of full-service carriers (with the obvious expection of IFE, food that is included in the ticket price and the like), I found the seats to be really comfortable and the window shade was innovative, what with the feature to dim the windows to suit your comfort level. I ordered an item from the duty-free catalogue before take off and I received it quickly. Although being a budget carrier means that it has no free food or drinks, the service level was not compromised-on par with its parent airline, Singapore Airlines. If you are expecting the seat pitch to be on a level with other budget airlines, then get ready for a surprise-the seat pitch was as good as some full-service carriers! Although I would recommend anyone taking Scoot (as with any budget airline) to bring your own entertainment on board- but overall, the flight experience was on par with that of other carriers and they landed in Hong Kong 15 minutes ahead of scheduled! Was an amazing flight, given the low fares and the good service, I would definitely take this airline again. However, one complaint that I do have is with the armrests - the attendant call button and the overhead lights button were on the armrests, so you could accidentally press them really easily and I had to take extra care to not push them.",0
2017,"After reading negative reviews about Scoot, I am very surprised as we had such a wonderful trip with them flying from Singapore to Gold Coast. The food was great, the service exemplary, and the trip both comfortable and safe. I actually had a wee dizzy spell (I am a diabetic) and the staff were incredibly attentive, showing both professional and personal care. I think there are no complaints by the people who travel a lot. They know the ins and outs of low cost carriers, ie the no bringing food aboard etc, as this is pretty commonplace worldwide. I found the food and chance to buy more if we wanted was excellent and not expensive. I found the TV/movie choices to be great, and they show them the new way most airlines are doing so now on your own device. I loved the fact I could use wifi onboard. All in all, I give Scoot top marks, and we will be flying with them again if ever out that way.",0
2017,"I flew from Singapore to Melbourne (return flight) with Scoot. On both journeys there was a delay with no explanations or any compensation. From SIN to MEL, the flight departed with a 2 hour delay, around 2am. Families with babies were extremely tired at this point and not even a cup of water was offered by Scoot staff. From MEL to SIN, so far it's 3 hours of delay and counting. I will definitely avoid this company in the future and will not recommend it to anyone, especially not families, unless the one and only consideration is money. I'm used to flying low cost companies but this one is really the worst.",1
2017,"We purchased a cheap deal ticket from Perth to Athens via Singapore to fly in July 2017. We only decided to go to Athens as it was such a cheap deal. Scoot was selling cheap tickets to establish its first route to Europe. We then went on to book all of our ongoing flights to Italy and accomodation. We are having our wedding in Italy so it's a very special trip. Scoot then changed our outgoing flight by 3 days. At first they were only willing to give a travel voucher for a refund, now they are offering a refund but it will take 8 weeks to process. In the meantime we still have to purchase tickets to Athens at a premium price - a destination that we didn't need to fly into, we only decided to go that route to save money. Our trip is now costing us a fortune. Scoot have completely soured our wedding trip. What should be the happiest time of our lives is now completely stressful. I do not recommend this airline and would never fly with them or Singapore Airlines again.",1
2017,"I booked a flight through Scoot, it was a 17hr journey from Tokyo to Bangkok then to Singapore then finally to Chennai. The flight itself was comfortable but all the excess fees that have to be paid are ridiculous. Water cost $4, food was also extra and I was flying for almost an entire day. If I wished for my bags to be flown straight to my final destination that was also extra by purchasing their ""scoot-thru"" service. There was no inflight entertainment at all. Although this airline had a good flight they nickel and dime you for everything. If you are not traveling to Singapore, near by or if your total flight time is longer than 7 hours, I would not recommend this airline.",1
2017,"Perth to Hong Kong via Singapore. I made a online booking for my son and myself. Although I was on the Scoot Website, I booked Scoot on the Perth - Singapore sectors but the Singapore - Hong Kong sectors were with Tiger Airlines. I paid for food on the Perth to Singapore sector and the Singapore to Perth sector. As well as seat allocation, so I could sit next to my son. I also paid for extra legroom (it was 79 AUD for each seat allocation with legroom on the Perth - Singapore return sectors. When we boarded in Perth, we were allocated our seats, but advised that we didn't order any food. As I didn't print out a hard copy of my reservation, I had no leg to stand on, and as had no wifi could not retrieve my booking. When I got to Singapore, they advised, that I had cancelled the meals (even thought I had been charged for them.) I ended up paying again for meals on board with cash. Was annoyed when I got to Singapore that we were flying Tiger, I thought we were flying Scoot. Before we returned I rang Scoot (was on hold and on the telephone call for just shy of 2 hours) to try and reinstate my meals. Scoot advised that I could not get a refund for the food not used on the first sector and now they could not guarantee any food on the return sector as was inside 72 hours. (I thought issue was resolved in Singapore on the way up), I was actually ringing to see why a seat hadn't been allocated out of Hong Kong for me as I had paid for it. I was advised that I had not paid for a seat. When we got to Singapore and was issued with boarding cards for the Singapore - Perth sector our seats were not where we had paid to sit. When I queried this, I was advised that ""we are just ground staff, we cannot do anything, and you will need to put it in writing"". I did this when I returned to Perth. Only to be advised by Scoot by email 2 weeks later that they were ""sorry for the inconvenience"" would give me a voucher for the value of 50 Singapore dollars (even thought on face value I paid $82 Singapore Dollars for each seat), and nothing was mention of the food that was not provided ($36.00). In total I spend $192.00 Australian Dollars for services I didn't receive. I will not be travelling on Scoot again.",1
2017,"I flew Bangkok to Singapore return on 26 January and 5 February respectively. Scoot uses Bangkok's older Don Mueang airport (DMK) which is slightly closer to the city centre than Suvarnabhumi airport and smaller which means a shorter trek between immigration and the boarding gates. I was not able to do an online check-in in BKK (which may not be an option out of BKK) but was able to do so for the return flight in SIN. I arrived at DMK about 90 mins before departure. There was barely any queues for check-in. After the online check-in in SIN, I was prompted to print my boarding pass which I did but there are many self-service stations near the Scoot check-in counters in Changi which prints the luggage tags and also issues boarding passes. Both flights departed on time and arrived at the destinations ahead of schedule even though the flight arriving into SIN was placed in a holding pattern for over 20 mins due to traffic in Changi. The plane from Bangkok to Singapore seems a little older with prominent carpet stains. The plane from Singapore was newer and somehow cleaner. Cabin crew were well trained and did several rounds of checks before departure and arrival. The level of detail to safety is not experienced even in some full service carriers. Announcements were clear and made in both English and Japanese. The seats have excellent recline which is way more generous than the other budget airlines I have flown on this route. Scoot flies the B787 which is my preferred plane compared to the other budget airlines which tend to fly single aisle planes for this route. If I were to fly budget carrier for the BKK-SIN route, I would choose Scoot because it offers better comfort.",0
2017,"Sydney to Singapore with Scoot. Check in process running well, good ground staff handling. This flight delayed 30 minutes in departure, but on time in arrival. Passenger seat occupancy maybe less than 1/3 of capacity. No problem with limited Legroom, because passenger can occupying 3 seats or more. I order chicken noodle 5 SGD and heaven and earth tea 4 SGD, accept banknotes or credit card. Okay for flying 8 hours. Friendly flight attendant. Arrival at Changi airport transfer using only 2 buses. It is really low cost carrier.",0
2017,"Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. Good points, beautiful modern Boeing 787, seats better than most premier league airlines, all 4 legs of my return flight left on time and arrived early. Decent and friendly staff. No problem checking in and reasonable wait. Bad points, it is budget so even if you pay the food will be poor, no entertainment, no free glass of water. I am used to deleting all add ons but no escape from Scoot, though even if you only have hand bag, nor $20 booking fee, add a cabin bag and $230 is 330+, and for one leg I even paid for unwanted insurance. Still cheaper than the premier league but now 2/3rd price not 1/2. I feel Singapore Airlines heart is not in it, both good and bad. Web page seems unreliable.",0
2017,"Sydney to Bangkok via Singapore. Nothing to complain. As a budget airline, much better than some main airlines. Flight was very comfortable, even without paying extra, legroom was same or better than regular airline. Cabin crew were very nice. All the four legs of my journey was on Boeing 787,  three times arrived at destinations 20 to 30 minutes early. Definitely don't worry about travelling next time with them.",0
2017,"Flew from Bangkok to Perth via Singapore. I like Scoot's 787 aircraft and the Economy class seats are some of the most comfortable around. For point to point travel they are a good deal, but I won't be using them for connecting flights again and here's why. Although Scoot will sell you an itinerary with connecting flights, the transit time can be very long. My original outbound schedule was changed such that it would have taken over 29 hours to arrive in Bangkok. I decided to connect in Singapore to another airline instead. Scoot does have a well-hidden policy for Australian travellers only, which allows for refunds in very limited circumstances - I did eventually get a partial refund on my flight, but only after I involved the Consumer Affairs authorities (and I still had to wait 10 weeks for the money). My return flight was a mere 17.5 hours elapsed, which was just about acceptable. But even though I had only carry on baggage, Scoot forced me to go through immigration in Singapore to get my onward boarding pass (after telling me in Bangkok that I could do this at the transfer desk). System limitations perhaps? Well no, if I had paid an extra $20 for ""Scoot-Thru"" they would have given me my boarding pass. Someone must have thought this was a great idea to make money out of customers, I think of it as a great way to lose customers. Another thing about connecting flights - according to the terms and conditions if you don't pay for Scoot-Thru and you miss your connection due to a delay by the airline, the airline won't help you at all - you've lost your flight! For the Singapore to Perth flight I paid THB970 for a ""super seat"". In extreme cases these seats can give you an extra 4 inches of leg room, but in my case it was only an extra 2 inches compared to my outbound flight - definitely not worth it. Speaking of extra expenses, the food is overpriced and awful. Vegetarian choices are particularly poor - and you're not allowed to bring your own. Scoot could have been a great airline, but by their mean-spirited practices they have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.",1
2017,"Flew Scoot from Singapore to Melbourne. Purchased a more expensive ticket for their 'scoot in silence' seats which promises an adult-only zone which is silent so you can sleep. However my and my wife's seat was directly next to the toilet, and consequently the queue, the flush and the banging door. It was actually the noisiest flight I've ever had. I complained and was told there was nothing they could do. I've also added up the money I save by the cheaper ticket, and with all the other hidden charges it would have been cheaper to fly with a better airline. Yes, they are a budget airline, but there are some things which shouldn't cost money, such as good service. When our plane was boarding, the staff were just talking to each other and a huge amount of people were confused and not even sure what was happening. The food is also terrible - we paid for two teas (yes you have to pay even for tea), and they bought two foam cups and handed us two tea bags. We asked for milk, and got a strange look, and eventually someone came back with powdered milk sachets.",1
2017,"Singapore to Perth. The flight was delayed repeatedly and we were informed after we arrived at the airport. The baggage drop-off queue was about 100 persons long since there was only 1 staff-person attending that took 45 minutes of waiting which makes a mockery of doing on-line check-in. The cabin crew spoke poor and heavily accented English even for crucial announcements, and seemed flustered all the time - as when asked any question. They did nothing to stop a parent allowing a child to play with balloons which burst periodically sounding like a gun-shot. Nor did they stop another woman watching a kung-fu movie on her tablet computer without head-phones. By the time one adds the check-in luggage, meals and seat selection, the ticket costs as much as an SIA flight if booked a little earlier. Since they do not have the same facility to check luggage through to a connecting flight, one has to have the expense and inconvenience of entering a transit country immigration-wise just to collect luggage and check it in again when the other airline commenced check-in many hours later. So the parent company gets almost the same fare for an airline operating much cheaper and so makes a greater profit! Seems like the reason for having Scoot is to run it so poorly is to make SIA look better by contrast, and convince passengers pay the slightly higher fare. In compensation for the flight delay Scoot offered a trifling voucher to use on another flight in the near future - a highly unlikely scenario for most.",1
2017,"Singapore to Sydney. I will definitely fly with Scoot again. A last-minute booking, only S$220, excellent plane. Although a 'budget' airline, many other airlines could learn from this company. The plane is very suitable for long haul. I did not purchase the food options so cannot comment about them. The plane was not full so there was plenty of space; however, even if the plane was full I believe that I would have had a comfortable flight.",0
2019,"Chiang Mai to Phuket. Worst airline. They charged my family of Four 5,000 bht ($227 CAD = $56 CAD/person) upon arrival to check our bags. They go by weight. Apparently you can pay the fee online which is 400 bht but they dont advertise it much. They also offer the lower price if youre 4 hours early (who would come that early). When we complained they said thats how it is and werent accommodating. Also no flight entertainment or food service on our flight. Would highly recommend a different airline.",1
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Shenzhen. I came for an early flight to China at 610am, made sure there won't be any screw ups. Boarding gate was P1 on the boarding pass, and I waited for over an hour, and I realized things wasn't right when I do not see any crowd at the gate. Went to check on the screen and it shows the boarding gate is Q7, and it has closed.  Explained my situation to the staff, looked at me and said there's 3 other passengers with the same situation but they all boarded the flight. Other staff told me to work things out at the service counter. Went to the service centre and things went back and forth where it felt like they are trying to look for any fault in the customer. They gave me a replacement flight, which is at 420pm, and two RM20 meal voucher. The summary is that the replacement tickets are a courtesy/favour and I should appreciate it.",1
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi. One of the first flights of the day, we departed on time. I managed to get a more comfortable window seat and also bought a meal which was delicious. I also used the 10 GB free wifi allowance.",0
2019,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. Mobile check in allowed me to avoid queuing in Jakarta. The plane left on time. It was pretty full and my middle seat felt quite uncomfortable. Other than that, the usual AirAsia flight with business like crew and a good selection of food for purchase.",0
2019,"Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. The check-In was well organized and the staff friendly. The departure / arrival was on time and the aircraft made an average maintained impression. The seat spacing was felt a bit lower than other airlines. Food and drinks were, for a low-cost airline, only for a fee. Overall, a good but not special experience.",0
2019,"Bangkok to Medan. Significant delay and no real apology. Flew QZ155. It only started to board at the time it should have been leaving, with no obvious reason (eg the incoming aircraft had been on time). Then crew running around and finding a passenger was missing. But then it took a further 30 minutes to find and offload the luggage from that passenger. So finally a delay of almost an hour. Not really acceptable on a 2-hour flight.",0
2019,"Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Even after adding in seat selection and 20kg of baggage, the price was still affordable and cheap considering that I only booked a month before the flight. There were problems with the self check-in as I had checked in online with AirAsia, luckily this was sorted out very quickly. Immigration at Changi Airport was very fast. The plane left on the dot at 7:35am and the gate my plane was at was the closest to the runway, so we were in the air very quickly. The seat pitch was just about okay for my height, and it was comfortable for a short flight. The plane was one of the older ones in AirAsia's fleet, not fitted with the sharklets seen on the newer A320s, and the cabin did show signs of ageingty. As it was a 40min flight and a budget airline, there was not much the cabin crew had to do but they were warm and friendly. One interesting perk about this flight was the ability to stream the inflight entertainment into my own device without needing to download a seperate app; all I had to do was to connect to the inflight WiFi which was enabled even on this short hop and I found it very unique, setting aside AirAsia from other budget carriers, and the selection was quite generous too, with some movies, documentaries and even games. The flight landed in Kuala Lumpur early and we had a short taxi into KLIA2, very quickly we were disembarking. Overall, given AirAsia's punctuality and cost, I would definitely pick AirAsia again if I'm travelling to Malaysia or want to travel on a budget.",0
2019,Bengaluru to Bali via Malaysia. Worst international flight I have ever travelled. No meals even after paying thousands of bucks for the flight. Flight seats are horrible. I would not prefer travelling in AirAsia.,1
2019,We had to rebook new tickets halfway through our trip due to the booking of flights too close together to make baggage transfer despite paying extra baggage charges and being  told our bags would transfer. A  rude customer service employee at  Kuala Lumpur airport told us it was our fault since if they had told us we did not have enough time then we would have done it anyway.,1
2019,"AirAsia have provided an excellent customer experience throughout our journey. The cabin crew were very polite and helpful. I have found that most of the passengers traveling from Hyderabad to Mumbai are local travelers with ""Telugu"" as the native language. The announcements made in flight are in ""English"" and ""Hindi"" languages. It would be very helpful for the passengers if the announcements in flight are made in the native language for the domestic flights. All the elderly passengers would be comfortable with this change. Hope to see this change from my next flight with you!",0
2019,"Delhi to Goa. 2.5 hour flight was delayed by over 2.5 hours and no alternative was given to take another flight instead. If they had just informed appropriately instead of informing about the delay half an hour at a time, we could have taken a different flight.",1
2019,"I chose Air Aisa because I was travelling with a child and no other directs flight to KL was available. First of all they force people to use PSA which sells expensive tickets by making a bank error on online service if using cards from Maldives. They lost my luggage cover, which was never found after struggles.  On my second sector to Kota Bharu- the que was long and when I reached to drop off the baggage (like a minute) they said I was too late and send me from one counter to another and made me wait and said I can board the plane without the luggage (while travelling with a 2 year old). No other options. Had to buy buy 2 extra tickets for me and the child. 3. When I left the trolley at a side, Air Asia staff told me to take it to the another location, I said I cannot leave my baby behind to put the trolley back, he mumbled rudely.",1
2019,Singapore to Bali. What a disappointing experience. We went to automatic check in. That machine worked for only one of us. The other one had to go to the counter to check in. Later once we already passed the customs we found out about not sitting next to each other and asked for a correction. This could only be changed if we were willing to pay extra. I asked if they could put us on an earlier flight so that I would be home sooner. This was possible but we had to buy new tickets!,1
2019,Our flight on November 2 from Lombok to Denpasar became memorable only because of the inflight service. A talented steward serenaded the passengers with a most lovely original song that soothed and enhanced the flight. A most unique personal touch we've never experienced in all our years of international travel.,0
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta delayed by 2hrs 50 mins. This is my last flight them. If you have connecting flight this airline will get you in trouble. This airline seems to attract people attracted to low price and fly point to point only, where long wait in the terminal and extensive delays does not matter.",1
2019,"Tagbilaran to Manila. AirAsia is extremely gimmicky and unprofessional! I've flown with very many different airlines for almost 40 years now and I've never ever experienced such unprofessional treatment. They are the only airline that counts your personal/cosmetic bag as part of carry-on baggage weight. However, they only selectively enforce this policy so that makes them utterly unprofessional. I chose to fly with AirAsia for the first time because they had the cheapest cost for my round trip from Manila to Tagbilaran/Panglao, Bohol in the Philippines. On the Manila, to Tagbilaran flight, my carry-on baggage and personal/cosmetic bag were not even checked or weighed at all, but on my flight back the customer service agent chose to enforce their stupid policy and made me pay an extra baggage fee. The worst part about this experience was that I was made to open and repackage my personal/cosmetic bag, carry-on bag, and checked baggage while I was at the check in counter. I was struggling to get the weight just right for them and a security guard noticed me struggling and whispered to me to just take out my laptop from my carry-on baggage because then AirAsia won't count it as carry-on weight if I only take out my laptop and carry it by hand. It's so damn ridiculous! Why didn't the customer service agent just tell me this and save me money, time, embarrassment, and frustration in the first place? Why did she make me go through all that trouble and money and time wasted? I also asked this customer service agent to let me speak with the manager and she just kept telling me ""ok"" or ""they're busy right now."" I also noticed that very few other passengers were made to weigh both their carry-on and personal/cosmetic bags as I were. This horrible airline is the worst airline I've ever flown on in my almost 40 years of flying all over the world on so many other different airlines and I will never ever fly with this joke of an ""airline"" ever again. If you want professional and fair service do not ever fly with Air Asia! They're just a gimmick and a huge joke!",1
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Guangzhou. The 2 year old A320 neo aircraft has a 186 seat configuration. The seats are quite comfortable, although legroom is quite small. The toilets at rear are very small. The taste of food is good. Our flight departed on time and reached Guangzhou 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Generally, we have no complaints on the flight.",0
2019,"Hanoi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Worst seats I have experienced in a plane. Be sure to choose a seat that's possible to recline. The distance between the seats are tiny. Me and my girlfriend got seats as far away from each other as possible. Asked if it was possible to get a seat next to each other but no. Even I saw later that there were two seats next to each other.  The Airasia part in KLIA is also bad, really crowded and not many places to eat/shop.",1
2019,"Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. When I booked this low-cost airline flight online I saw no indication that the ticket did not include checked bags.  I ended up paying $400 additional for checked baggage. Onboard the flight there is no free meal, no free water, no in-flight entertainment screen, renting a blanket is 10MYR.",1
2019,"I flew from Cengkareng Airport in Jakarta to Changi in Singapore. There are too many bad things flying with this airline. I paid about $250 for a two-way ticket Jakarta to Singapore. At the website, I had to pay an additional $30 for check-in baggage. When I checked-in, the female staff were rude. No greetings and pretending to be busy like I was invisible. And them the flight was late. Scheduled to depart at 11.20 am. At 12.30 pm the plane was still on the runway waiting for take off. As a result, the flight was late about an hour arriving in Singapore. I had a meeting at 4 pm on the same day and I was late and it was embarrassing because they thought I was not punctual. When in fact, it was caused by Air Asia. And then, when returning home, the staff in Singapore were rather mute. They just saw us, say nothing and kept working. Hello? Are you human or robot? Can you talk? Wow? They call Air Asia a company? Even a 1 star hotel in Singapore does a better service. I would say improve the service or good luck in the future.",1
2019,"Hyderabad to Mumbai with AirAsia. One of the worst airlines ever seen who doesn't care about customers and who keep delaying flights indefinitely. Never ever travel by this airline as your important schedule is going to be gone, 100% guaranteed. One of the most lowest grade airlines.",1
2019,"Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. I had a 3 hour-ish flight with this one. The check-in was not really fast even though it's self-service and there are many security checks. The boarding time was delayed for roughly 20 minutes. The food I had on the flight (teriyaki chicken rice and curry puff) was just average. The crew is quite young, they did okay service. Seats can recline,  Legroom is terrible. The best thing you can do on this one is having a sleep. Don't choose this airline if you can afford any other options.",1
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu with AirAsia. Poor airline with excessive seat rows and extremely tiny seats. Flights were delayed on both ways with no compensation. Delays were an hour and felt like the delays were somewhat on purpose for the airline to save money. When boarding gates, no personnel came to check details and everyone just stormed into the gate. This is by far the worst experience I ever had on an airline. Only travel on this airline if you like to arrive late to your destination.",1
2019,Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was delayed one hour due to late arrival of aircraft. A little rough in parts due to the weather. Cabin staff were humorous and that made a big difference.,0
2019,Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. It was a flight delayed about one hour. The flight was comfortable and I slept a little. Did not purchase anything as I was not hungry. We arrived in Bali around 1:30am one hour late.,0
2019,"Sibu to Kota Kinabalu. I miss the flight due the aircraft left 13 minutes before scheduled departure time. When approached the ground staff the only explanation they gave me, is very common so is my fault that I miss the flight. I had to reschedule all my appointment and pay extra for a new ticket. The worst experience by far.",1
2019,"Bali to Bangkok. Chaos at check in counter in Bali! The counter opened late and passengers were nervous. There were many flights leaving around the same time, passengers from earlier flights tried to skip the queue and go first making other passengers furious. There were no sign indicating which flight should check in first and which flight later, so passengers clustered everywhere in front of check in counters. Very unpleasant experience.",1
2019,"Bangkok to Hat Yai. Lack of standard among ground staff. I pre-purchased 20kg of sport equipment baggage aiming to cover 2 bags of mine. (The combined weight of my 2 bags was 18kg.) A ground staff told me that I could only check in one bag and had to hand carry my other bag. Her reason was that the other bag could not be sport equipment! I've traveled with sport equipment several times with AirAsia, but this was the first time a ground staff refused to check in both bags because such staff believed that my other bag could not be sport equipment! I wonder why other ground staff from my previous flights never had a problem with me..",1
2019,"Bali to Seoul via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia sent us an email the morning of our flight stating that they pushed back our departure. We contacted the customer service chat and tried to resolve the issue. The initial agent said that they would put us on an earlier flight out of our current location, however, they failed to provide us a case number. Additionally, they stated that the flight change would be processed in 2 to 3 hours, which is ridiculous. We had to contact a second customer service agent through their chat service. They then provided us with our case number but reiterated that they could not expedite our flight change any faster than the 2 to 3 hours quoted by the initial agent. When we asked if there was a number we could call the agent stated that they are in the process of closing all of their call centers. They did nothing to ease the stress of having a last-minute flight change that would make us miss a day of work. This was unhelpful and led to the last few hours of our vacation being stressful and having to re-arrange multiple plans. Definitely not good customer service.",1
2019,"Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. I arrived at the Gate 4 at the Kuching International Airport at 9.20 this morning (12 Sept 2019) for the 9.30  Kuching-KL flight, but the push-back for the plane had already taken place. The ground crew gave me an excuse as to why the plane departed 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Consequently, I had to purchase a later flight (10.50 Kuching-KL flight) at a cost of RM349. If the plane in actuality departs 10 minutes earlier, then the Airline should state inform passengers that the flight was scheduled at 9.20, not 9.30 am.",1
2019,"Hanoi to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Customer service could not have been more unhelpful. We had credits towards a flight that due to a bug in their system they werent able to apply to our flight. Which is questionable - why should we pay for their error and incompetence? Every time we tried to rectify the issue we were issued a new agent and new complaint number and had to start from scratch every time. In the end, they said they were working to applying it towards our flight but it could also be used to pay for baggage. Of course the problem was never resolved, so we assumed we could at least check our baggage using our credits. Wrong. Apparently there is no systemic connection between the people at the air Asia counter and the customer service people online. The people at the counter were unhelpful at best. Ultimately, the customer service online system and the physical counter at airasia are somehow not linked. Very advanced system! We were told we had to request online 4 hours in advanced of the flight to use the credits towards our baggage. Of course this was not mentioned by customer service online. The people behind the counter were very rude and condescending and made no attempt to resolve the problem other than to tell us to contact online customer service - the same folks who had not responded to any of our recent inquiries/ noted we could just apply the credits to our baggage for our next flight. I have had the shit beaten out of me by a bunch of meth heads, and I preferred that to dealing with air Asias customer service.",1
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Flight was delayed by 6 hours and AirAsia could not accommodate me getting on to another flight. I was travelling for a specific event which I could not miss, so I had to purchase another ticket on another airline at KL airport. AirAsia could not be more unhelpful and told me to go through their AVA chat line to request a refund for my missed flight. I did - only to find out that my case was never recorded. Just tried to process the refund again and ran into technical issues. The ordeal was extremely stressful and expensive, and their customer service is a joke.",1
2019,Colombo to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. It was a nice flight with no problems. Boarding was orderly. Seats were comfortable and I got some rest. A nice budget airline. Will fly them in the future.,0

2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Nha Trang with AirAsia. Simply the worst airline in the world, many years running. Ive been unfortunate enough to have to rely on this sorry excuse for an airline for years and not once, not once, have I ever had a good experience. Not a single flight that went smoothly, with no delay or some other nonsense. Awful service, always late, anything to take your money and always unpleasant. The only thing they havent charged us for yet is oxygen on board, which at some point it will probably be charged also, 10 cents per breath. If only there were other options for certain destinations. Todays misfortune: retiming of flight the day before, only to come to airport, go to gate as indicated and find out there (i.e. at the gate) that there would be another delay on top of a change in gates. Still waiting to board, holiday ruined. Avoid this airline if you can. Pay more, get better service somewhere else.",1

What's worse is that the company makes airport staff charge people fees to check in bag. I had a total of 14kg with two small bags. The staff made me check in my bag and charged me nearly 90USD ""for 0-15kg overweight"".  To top it all off, the staff lost my bags' special cover during transit and took no responsibility for it. They said ""that's not covered by us"" I will not fly AirAsia for these reasons.",1
2019,"This was an evening flight. I was worried the flight might be delayed when taking-off or landing (because DMK and CGK packed with passengers!) However we landed 30mins ahead of schedule!

2019,"Actually I'm flying AirAsia Indonesia, the first flight of the day. Ground service is normal, quick check-in and baggage drop although when entering boarding gate (is it normal at CGK, one boarding gate could serve 2 different flights) did not put clear signs indicating which queue lines were for which flight, some passenger queued in the wrong line. Delayed take-off due to runaway congestion and bad visibility (maybe) but we still landed ahead of schedule. Food, I ordered Chicken Kungpao with rice and it was just bad. The rice and chicken were super dry, sauce too watery and taste like soy sauce. Not what you expect of kungpao chicken.",0

I booked a hire car through the AirAsia website which upon selecting the car diverts you to cartrawler.com - I received a congratulations for booking email and an updated itinerary with hire car noted. 45 mins prior to departure I received another email starting a hire car cannot be provided, I attempted to book another prior to boarding but was unsuccessful so figured Id just get one on arrival- this was unachievable at KLIA 2 as no office wanted the hassle an hour prior to closing. After an hour of phoning 24 hour hire car companies I gave up, which meant the Hotel that was booked and paid for in JB was not used and unable to be refunded and the trip planned to Legoland with my 5, 7 and 10 year old sons was now canceled. Shame on you AirAsia and your inefficient car hire partner  - you spoiled the highlight of our school holiday adventure",1

2019,Bali to Siem Reap via Kuala Lumpur. They charged me around 250 dollars for my baggage of 24.4 kg although it did not let me buy luggage online beforehand.  What kind of airline has such costs and flexible luggage rate based on which check in agent you get?,1

2019,"Phuket to Chiang Mai with AirAsia. Worst service I have ever experienced on an aircraft. I'm 6'4"" tall and literally could not sit in my seat without physically bruising my knees as the legroom is that short. I stood for entire flight apart from when seatbelt signs were on and came away with bad bruising to both my knees. Despite there being 11 extra legroom seats available the cabin crew would not let me sit there (even for extra payment that I offered) but instead just smiled at me as I stood. I showed then the damage the seat had done to my knees after take off and they just did not care. I watched them throw a lady out of the extra legroom seat who was trying to breastfeed a baby, this is how uncaring they are. On making a subsequent complaint I received a totally inadequate reply from them. If you are over 5'8"" do not use. I am now looking at taking legal action for my injuries and suffering as only way I can see these airlines learning.",1
2019,Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru. I bought the ticket online for 75MYR including checked baggage of 20 kg when I reached the airport they charged me 90.10MYR for 15kg baggage which is the only baggage I have because I didn't check in 4 hours before the flight. The flight got delayed 1 hour. They destroyed my bag.,1
2019,"Krabi to Bangkok. I'm 6' (1.8 meters) tall and my knees were touching the back of the seat. Absolutely no leg room.

By the time one adds luggage fees, choosing a seat fee, credit card fee and other fees, the prices generally are not much cheaper than other airlines.",1
2019,"Cebu to Manila. Customer Service useless. I had issues in booking, basically I have earned many Big Points along the years plus I had Credit Account Balance to get some discount during bookings. I have tried during different bookings to apply the credit I had with AirAsia but neither the Big Points or the Credit Account ever worked, I applied them but they magically disappeared whenever I click the magic button ""pay"" and the full amount has always been charged to my bank account. I have complained a couple of times but the only answer those ""customer service representative"" give is some template answer saying that they are sorry bla bla bla and my points are still there to redeem. This is ridiculous and disappointing, never had such a bad customer service being a Gold member as they call me.",1
2019,Lombok to Kuala Lumpur. The luggage fees are outrageous. Airport security tell us we cant take a tripod. The baggage people should be aware of what we can not take with us.  Will never be flying this airline again.,1
2019,"If you're a person with a disability, do not travel with Air Asia from Don Mueang Airport. You will have to climb the stairs to get on the plane. Even if you pay 600 Thai bahts for the wheelchair service, this stops at the departure gate! A family member or friend can do it. I guess they don't want to pay for direct access to their aircraft? Of course the bus does not stop at the edge of the platform, you'll have to get down a high step and then get on the bus, one more step. Then get off the bus, one more step and a nice stair is waiting for you and your disability! In fact, Air Asia has changed its slogan: ""Now the disabled can walk"" And Don Mueang airport is changing its name, it is now the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes Airport! The place where miracles happen, in this case, it's a paid miracle, a miracle that will never happen.",1
2019,"Wanted to order a coke can called the flight attendant saying excuse me thrice. On the third try the guy showed me his hand to wait.  I'll be skipping this airline due to the attitude of a flight attendant. As a low-cost airline no tv, no free food and the baggage allowance can't go more than 20 kg for which you have to pay too. The least they could do was to provide a good customer service.",1
2019,"Jakarta to Bali. So happy to see AirAsia finally use paper box for their food. I hope they will provide reusable spoon and forks instead of plastic soon.

2019,"Delhi to Bangalore with AirAsia. Knowing that my bags were overweight, I made sure to send a courier back home before flying back. Turns out I was 3 kgs overweight which even an airline like Air India was willing to let go of (yes, I had a connecting flight prior to my Air Asia reservation). When I checked-in I was told that my bags were overweight and that I needed to pay 1200 rupees. Had a bag less than 2kgs for cabin luggage which should have been taken into consideration but wasnt. Never mind the 1200 bucks. No big deal. What really angered me was learning that AirAsia charged a single mother travelling with her 9 year old son 300 rupees to get seats next to each other. I mean, Ive seen inhuman and now Ive seen AirAsia! What level of exploitation does an airline company need to adhere to make money? I mean, how do people who make money through these days extremely cheap and disgusting ways sleep at night? Its a 9 year old child. Knowing that parents will do anything to have a sense of security over their children, AirAsia has done the unthinkable!

I would understand the expectation to pay some kind of a fee for updating the flight destination, but the fact that they don't even offer it as an option is an extreme inconvenience.  Air Asia prevents you from changing flights is to force you into paying for an entirely new flight. I will be doing this as I have no other option, but I will certainly not be flying with Air Asia again.",1

2019,Hong Kong to Krabi. A couple that travel together and also book together the ticket should be seatead next to each other but at check in they say 'sorry seat are given by computer' so we didn't seat next to each other. Super annoying.,1
2019,Penang to Kuala Lumpur. Good take off and landing. Cabin crew are all very nice and informative. I always choose this airline. You get what you pay right. Dont be such a fussy when you only just a few pennies.,0
2019,"CGK-KUL flight was delayed by 45 min due to some runway repairs that we could see from the window. Flight arrived only slightly late. KUL-MAA flight landed 20 min ahead of time. Although I was flying on cheap tickets I could buy exit row aisle seats for both flights. The middle seat remained vacant in both flights probably because no one wants to pay for the pleasure of sitting in the middle seat! In both flights the meal that I had preordered turned out to be pretty tasty. This is what I like about this airline - at the time of booking you can buy the degree of comfort that you want, verify it and then pay for it. Many other airlines would not allow cheap ticket holders to select premium seats. After flying full service airlines on business for decades I have recently switched to AirAsia in part due to the simplicity of the whole process - booking, seat and meal selection, checkin and boarding. The entire meal service is over quickly and they leave you in peace for the rest of the flight. If you need any snack or drink you could walk to the galley and buy it. Also for destinations in the South, SE Asia region they seem to offer the fastest connections.",0
2019,Bali to Kuala Lumpur. The ticket amount excludes check in baggage which we did not notice while booking.  We had to add 25 kg luggage allowance at 3050 extra. There was no free food and not even a free cup of water on this low-cost airline. At Bali airport we reached 2 hr before and were waiting for boarding at designated gate. We just escaped missing our flight as they changed gate before 1 hr.,1
2019,"Kota Bharu to Kota Kinabalu return. Ontime departure & arrival (10-20 minutes earlier arrival for both journey). Reasonable crew, tasty food. Wished that AirAsia will increase the frequency direct flight to 4x week at least. Will fly with them again.",0
2019,"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya with AirAsia. Swift check-in and orderly boarding followed by a 25 mins late departure due to some passengers not showing up. Plane nearly full, crew all male. Uneventful flight.",0
2019,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. Everything went smoothly. Check in and boarding were painless, and the flight both departed and arrived a bit early. Seats comfortable, meals and drinks available at extra cost as usual.",0
2019,"Manila to Bangkok. The worst part was the check in counter. I had already checked in online but had to check in my pre-paid for luggage. I was there approx 3.5 hours prior to boarding time yet the line up took over 1.5 hours. It was  chaos and only 2 employees checking everyone in. Standing for 1.5 hours is outrageous. Then we boarded the plane 40+ mins late. Once we got on the plane we didnt leave the tarmac for another 70 minutes. I was unable to make my connecting flight to Chiang Mai. The next flight out was over 7 hours later and air Asia did nothing about it. No hotel, no vouchers, no compensatio.. I had to sleep in the airport, miss a half day of my vacation in Chiang Mai and forfeit my hotel I had pre purchased for in Chiang Mai for the night. Talked to several different air Asia employees in Bangkok airport, none of which were even the least bit helpful or simpathetic. Wont  fly airasia again.",1
2019,"Bangkok to Krabi. The check-in was fast and the ground staff friendly. For a low-cost airline AirAsia offers a good seating distance, for a small extra charge and food and water as a drink. The plane made a well-kept and well-maintained impression. With this airline you get a good price-performance ratio.",0
2019,"Krabi to Chiang Mai. Months before departure my direct flight was moved from 03:00 pm to 8:30 pm. Due to missing alternatives, I accepted this shift. Otherwise I was satisfied with the airline. Small, good tasting food and water as a drink. The flight was punctual and without any special occurrences.",0
2019,"Flew Kuala Lumpur to Penang with AirAsia. The airline generally offers a great price for my distance I have to travel. However, the cabin crew doesn't really greet us while we board the aircraft which makes us feel a little bit unwelcome. The legroom is also below average but fortunately it is just a very short flight.",0
2019,Clark to Cebu. Check in counter is not yet open even if already almost an hour before our boarding time. Your staffs here in Clark are not helpful nor accommodating!,1
2019,Jakarta to Penang. Cheap flight without free baggage and free meals. Worth it and value for money pricing for flight. Must book long long time before flight to get cheap price of the flight.,0
2019,"Perth to Bali. Absolutely shocking customer service. An error occurred when booking my flight, AirAsia was impossible to deal with and refused to change my return date unless I paid $150. I escalated the issue to management and after weeks of following up I have just received a response 2.5 months after first lodged declining to refund. Do not fly with this Airline.",1
2019,"Colombo to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. This is the fifth time that I flew with Air Asia. I've used a few other budget airlines and the services, seats, etc. are standard for any budget airlines - so no complaints. However, I made a purchase for food/drinks on Air Asia, the cabin crew would say that they did not have a small change & promised to give me the change later. On my recent trip from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur, they owed me RM4 and didn't give me the change (I forgot to ask them before I left).",1
2019,Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Flight departed & arrived on time. Cabin crew were courteous but distant. Lucky enough to be sitting in an empty row although flight was more than half full. Short flight so nothing much more to add on.,0
2019,Hong Kong to Chiang Mai. Both out-bound and in-bound flights were on-time. Very little or no turbulence experienced during journeys. This was very good. Check-ins at ground were fast and efficient. Will choose Air Asia again in the future.,0
2019,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Plane departed almost an hour late. Other than that, it was the usual AirAsia flight, with added comfort provided by the two seats next to mine being vacant.",0
2019,Utapao to Kuala Lumpur. On December 16th I travelled from Pattaya to Kuala Lumpur. It was a great flight and very comfortable. I like the Pattaya airport a lot and it is very small and comfortable.,0
2019,Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast. It was a great flight and very comfortable. The flight was not full and I had three seats to myself. I like the Gold Coast airport a lot and it is very small so customs and immigration is very fast.,0
2019,"Bangkok to Denpasar. Uneventful but fairly comfortable fligh . As much as such a flight can be comfortable. It helps when a flight is half full as ours was. Professional crew and as expected they will do anything to promote what ever they sell. If crew on regular airline would make water runs half as often as i have had the drinks sales trolley pass on airasia flight this would make flying more comfortable. On the flight to Denpasar we had what seems to be a new A320 from AirAsia indonesia , return flight on a very tired A320 from AirAsia Thailand. Enjoyed my flights, will surely use them again.",0
2018,"Sapporo to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. We had to wait 3 hours after arriving in Kuala Lumpur to board our next available flight. We promptly informed the fly thru staff that we have a checked in baggage on our ticket from Japan to Kuala Lumpur which also needs to be transferred. She said it has been done. However we reached Singapore airport to find our baggage missing! Still following up with authorities for tracking my missing baggage. Never have had such bad service.  They seem cheap but make up all their money on baggage, food, seat selection etc.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. AirAsia is known with low-cost fare, but does it mean Low cost = no service? Other than Low-cost fare, Air Asia well known with flight delay, flight rescheduled, poor customer service. It happens regularly that the flight rescheduled on every single flight. Other than the Air Asia low price on promotion is attractive, you'll not surprise if you heard any bad feedback comment about how AA disappointing customer. I'm not the first one and I believe will not be the last one. How AA Customers support system fooling customer around? It must be a platform to train your patience. AA customer support system has 4 ways to contact Air Asia which are Live chat (24/7), call centre, Twitter(24/7) and e-form. I have tried 4 of them: Live chat (24/7): it has been removed - 26 Dec 2018 URL No Longer Exists You have to wait for average 1 hour on live chat queue to say hi to a live chat staff. If you miss the screen when the conversation started, you will kick out from the chatroom by livechat staff, when you check back the screen, it showed ""thank you for contacted live chat"". You have to wait for another one hour. Live chat staff could simply end your conversation without your notice, so even your question not yet finish,you will be kicked out by the staff again. Call centre: I have called to call centre from Malaysia at RM2 per minute! I wanted to buy/add-on/upgrade my baggage to 25kg (3 days before my flight), but it is no longer available on ""modify"" at the airasia homepage. The only way is you have to call them (yes waste time + money), otherwise it would me RM45/kg (not sure they increase the price or not) at the check-in counter. waiting time: generally 10 minutes. Twitter (24/7) the so-called ""24/7"" Twitter service is totally a lie. You can tweet them 24/7, but they will only reply to you immediately, most of the time a few hours or few days. (tweet them for 5 months due to my lost bag case). When the staff is free they will tell you Please wait for the investigation or there's not much they can do, please contact live chat/call/e-form. Live chat, twitter and call centre will push all the responsibility to e-form. Ask you to contact e form. E-form has annoyed and wasted my time the most. It took few days/about 1 month to reply to you, they could just reply sorry that they have done their best and simply closed the case straight after. I've created the same case for 3 times because the staff closed my case without solving my problem, but it is written in the email that my case has been solved, or you didn't reply the email within 7 days. Here comes the tactic: at first you can still contact the AA staffs, but after 3-4 emails, suddenly your reply cannot reach to the AA support team and this will end up case closed because the system shows that you didnt reply to the AA email. When you reply, a no reply email message will tell you that your case has closed, if you need any assistant, please send an e form again! I strongly advise you be aware when you book the AA ticket. The price is really attractive, but please make sure you add on all the bag, meal etc. For the locals, I suggest you check also the price from Malaysia Airlines, Fireflyz and Malindo.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong. Traveling on Air Asia back home on Christmas day. KLIA2 was orderly, not too much that mad rush. Experience with the Premium Flex had been most positive, from check in to arrival. Plane slightly delayed by 30 minutes, which was minor. A surprising light load, with many empty seats, I had all 3 hot seats of row 3 to myself! Therefore, service is quicker and crew very courteous. The chicken rice was delicious. Rest of the flight was uneventful and relaxing. Overall, it's worth to pay that little extra on Air Asia.",0
2018,"I don't often fly with LCC, but given the good flight schedule and attractive price (even at premium flex, both way), I thought to give that a go. I was very pleasantly surprised how smooth things were. From check in to boarding, and through to KL. It was a nice touch that premium flex passengers were entitled a 30kg, a free meal, frontal hot seats, exclusive check in counter and priority luggage. I found out sourced ground staffs in HKG courteous, boarding was orderly, where priority for premium flex passengers were strictly observed. Seat pitch of hot seats were quite ok, just like any regular economy class of any airlines. Cabin crew are energetic and do their job well. Pre-ordered meal was actually quite tasty, mine was a kung-pao chicken with a free water. The duty free item I ordered was delivered to me with a smile. Plane took off and landed on time. KLIA2 is a good terminal with many shops and eateries. I am very satisfied with the whole experience.",0
2018,"Shenzhen to Kota Kinabalu. The FA leaned on the desk without smile at boarding time, after entering the cabin, the FAs didn't assist any woman or elderly person in packing their luggage. They just standing in the aisle. And the FA called me back to my seat, I just want to changed seat with others. I don't think I  can understand the flight attendant instructions in case of an emergency. It was a Red-eye flight, everyone wanted to sleep, but the cabin was always lit. And they spoke so loudly that I could hear laughter with earplugs. I  didn't sleep all night. Although I don't want any service, it's very uncomfortable for me to have a bad rest on a 3 hour flight.",1
2018,"Hong Kong to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur. During 4 legs of my journey, 3 are delayed. As we rush in the airport to go to the next leg, there is no notice about our next flight being delayed thus prompting us to rush even though we should not need to rush. During the delay, there is no compensation. The flight attendants is far from friendly. They seem to be more apt at ordering people around. The seating is cramped. They wanted all electronics to be switched off, not just on airplane mode during take off and landing.",1
2018,Penang to Bangkok. Late and there is no explanation nor updates. This is the 2nd air asia flight in less than a week and both are delayed. It wasn't like this a few years back. Has it expanded too big and they cannot cope?,1
2018,Bangalore to Chennai with AirAsia. Pathetic. Very unpunctual. Flight was delayed multiple times. Nearly 6 hrs delay to Chennai. If informed earlier could have caught a bus. Was travelling to meet a relative in critical condition.,1
2018,"Ubon Ratchathani airport to Don Mueang airport in Bangkok. The check in was simple the front desk personally was great and efficient. The security check point at airport was no hassle and simple. Overall my check in was fantastic. Cabin crew was quick and efficient with getting everyone ready and quick with serving all the meals. The only but I have about this flight or airlines was they have so many rules.  Specially seems like lot of rules now that they announced them in 3 languages, Thai, English, Mandarin Chinese.",0
2018,"Bangkok to Jaipur. It becomes painful when you travel with your family, don't travel with small kids as this flight has no space for your legs. Very bad experience, my little kid and wife had a bad time for over four hours in this flight.",1
2018,Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. We didnt get our assigned seats as the plane was changed last minute. We were told to sit anywhere until they have everyone seated which meant we had to constantly get up to give up the seats. This was not a good experience. The staff did not apologise. One staff member got very rude to us and shouted at us to be patient. Our flight got delayed by 70 minutes. Will not be flying with them again that's for sure!,1
2018,Singapore to Kota Kinabalu. Bad counter staff attitude on seating. Boarding pass error and staff was unwilling to assist. System error on web check in. Feedback casually sweeped under.,1
2018,"Cebu to Manila. Nearly 4 hours delayed. First it started with an email that the flight will be delayed due to further servicing then a second email on our way to the airport. However I heard at checked in counter desk a different reason that the assigned aircraft is not available but a new plane will be coming from Manila. And the lady at the counter told me that the plane will be further delayed. Once we passed security, we saw the departure screen was flashing further time of departure. So not sure who to believe anymore but I see lots of lies from AirAsia. This is the second time I actually experience this coming from Cebu so will try other airlines from now on and see who is better at keeping their time and also with communication consistency.",1
2018,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. It was my latest worst experience with AirAsia. During check-in, baggage check-in was quite fast. In the new airport, it was comfortable and many lanes that open for passengers to check-in. However, the flight got delayed for an hour and additional another hour. AirAsia which know for its time accuracy got hit really bad with this one.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Before I got into the gate, Airasia wasn't that strict with the baggage 7kg rule check, which is good. Boarding was quite efficient. It was quick and departed according to the time and staff were friendly and helpful.",0
2018,"I think this is the best budget airline in south east Asia. The cabin crew was nice, ground handling is fast, good online check in platform, good customer service. I got no delay when I go to KL but when i back to Jakarta, I got delay around a hour but its ok. The seat is so so, food was good, no inflight entertainment. The ticket from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur round trip is $30 cheaper than any domestic flight in Indonesia.",0
2018,Chiang Mai to Macau. AirAsia ripped my suitcase after the flight and everything broken. I connect by AirAsia application and complain about it and I didnt received any advise after one week. They ignoring me. Please dont fly with this company.,1
2018,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. I have taken several flights from AirAsia. Flight delay is a norm. Had enough of flight delay from this airlines. The turnaround time for plane is just too short. One delay will have an impact on the downstream flight.,1
2018,"Vientiane to Singapore via Bangkok. In Vientiane the check-in counter asked for $200 USD for 2 bags. That is airport/airline robbery. They said it was because we had booked a transfer but we booked from Vientiane to Singapore, they had the stopover in Bangkok included in the booking. I have flown hundreds of time on dozens of different airlines and never been charged for a transfer when the booking is with one airline through their website. Also the price is gross and disrespectful to their customers. My partner and I shuffled items around to fit into one checked bag, however, the whole process was horrible, ridiculous, and not customer friendly. I can't believe we had to pay $100 for one bag for one booking. I am very upset and irritated, I will never book with them again.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru booked to travel next week. They have the worst customer support, they ignore client when they answer you, they ask you to follow up with them after 5 days. I got problem in my account which was disabled, I contacted their support who answered me after long time them asked me to come back to them after 5 days, although they have all my contact details.",1
2018,Bangkok to Bali. I recently booked a flight with Air Asia through their website. I was very careful to uncheck as many of the automatically checked add-ons during the check-out process. There was one add-on for travel insurance that I missed. I was subsequently charged for travel insurance when it was not something I intended to purchase. I wrote to them requesting a refund that they promptly informed me that it was not possible as I did not untick the box for travel insurance. Why on earth would they require a customer to untick an add-on rather than ask them if they would like an add-on and have them initiate the add-on with a tick? I am truly disappointed that this is how they operate.,1
2018,"Short flight from Singapore to Kuching, midday flight on a Sunday. Flight was more than 50% empty, so obviously the overall experience was better. Boarding was on time and efficient, and crew were reasonably pleasant. For this short flight, I had paid for the first row of seats, and so legroom was aplenty. The A320 had obviously seen quite a lot of service, seats were clean but felt like the cushions had sagged a little. Halfway through the flight, was impressed that inflight connectivity (rokki) allowed reading of the AirAsia inflight magazine, brief travel guides, news and simple games on iPad, all for free. Impressive for a no-frills airline. Flight landed on time, and disembarkation was fuss free. If seat comfort was a tad better, this would be a 5-star low-cost airline flight.",0
2018,Hyderabad to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Because of delay of flight from Hyderabad we missed connecting flight and received a poor response from AirAsia staff in Malaysia airport,1
2018,"Denpasar to Hong Kong via Bangkok. This is my first time flying with Air Asia. I was apprehensive of the questionable standard since it's a budget airline which gives the bare minimum, but get you from A to B. I took the plunge and tried to return to Hong Kong from Bali with it. It was operated by Thai Air Asia. I booked fly+bag+eat combo, sat on front row seat. Check in at Bali airport was friendly and efficient. I am happy to report that the experience had been very positive. Crew were courteous and smiling. Ordered meals were promptly delivered, and it actually tasted ok. I like the fact that Air Asia makes no qualm about bringing outside food and drink on board for own consumption. Seat was bound in leather, well padded and comfortable for the 4 hour journey. There was a lay over of 2 hours in Bangkok old airport Don Muang, it was welcoming as one could stretch the legs and do some shopping, or eat a good meal before the 2nd leg. The same good standard of service continued for the next flight back home. I was able to check my bags through from bali to Hong Kong. Transit process was very simple and direction crystal clear. Upon arrival, my bags were one of the first to come out. The fly bag eat combo actually do include priority luggage, a really nice touch. I also noticed that the 2 flights left and arrived on time. Based on the good experience, I will not hesitate to fly with them again in future.",0
2018,"I had the best customer experience on this AirAsia flight flying from Manila to Cebu on 4th  September. Excellent inflight service and entertainment for the guests. Pleasant music played throughout the journey, food was very good plus an hitherto unseen entertainment for guests on flight. The airhostess(two of them) woke us all up by their energetic dance performance. This was followed by a quiz. Correct answers were awarded with AirAsia goodies. Perfect holiday experience.",0
2018,"Semarang to Kuala Lumpur. The flight departed from the new International airport in Semarang, which was great. Self-check in machines are available, which can cut down queue lines. Nevertheless, the line to queue to the plane was quite unmanageable.",0
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Semarang. I was able to checked in earlier, 2 weeks before the departure time. The flight was on time from KL to Semarang, and apparently arrived 10 minutes earlier. Stewards were friendly to the passengers. It was a good flight for low-cost airline.",0
2018,"I missed my connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, my own fault, reported my situation and was advised how to book next connecting flight and organise my retrieval of luggage, looking totally confused, I hastily took off to correct my mistake, hopefully. An agent caught up with me and explained it would be quicker and easier for him to organise.  He returned after a short period, having had to run from Gate K to Gate J and return with both my boarding pass and luggage ticket. I was so grateful as he had taken the initiative to go far and beyond his duties to fix my problem. This person should be highly recommended for advancement in the company as he put the company first for customer service which was so appreciated.",0
2018,"Phuket to Hanoi via Bangkok. I wasnt sure about AirAsia at first, but we had absolutely no problem. I am scared to fly, but it was a smooth ride. No food or entertainment provided, which was fine as it was under 2 hours flight. I would definitely fly again.",0
2018,"Kunming to Bangkok. I booked my ticket with them well in advance and also pre-purchased baggage as it is cheaper to do so. I realized my ticket would be non-refundable if I had to cancel this flight, but I expected them to grant a credit with the airline for future flights. But they refused to refund any amount, even the baggage fees, and didn't grant any credit for future flights. This level of customer service is appalling.",1
2018,Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City. What a joke. My friend and I bought ticket together under 1 transaction. Airline let us sit separately when checked in. Reason: all seats are full. We bought ticket 4 months in advance. When they heard that they asked us to request the in-flight attendant. Of couse that didn't work and we ended up sitting separately. Bottom line: don't buy this airline if you travel in group.,1
2018,Hyderabad to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. My flight scheduled at 11.50 pm and it delayed by 3.5 hours. I have a transit of 2.5hrs in Malaysia and need to catch flight to Melbourne which I cant catch due to this delay. When I ask the counter person about the connecting flight they said the next connecting flight will be in 2.5 hrs after I landed in Malaysia. But when I went to transfer counter in Malaysia they said the next connecting flight is after 12hrs and gave me couple of meal vouchers. Obviously very poor customer service and most unreliable. Counter people are useless as they dont have knowledge of the flight schedule. I requested them for  lounge entry which they rejected to give. I have spent $100 to book a room in the airport. Should reach Melbourne 8.00 pm local time and I reached next day morning 8.00 am and took day off from my work.,1
2018,Ho Chi Minh City to Phuket via Bangkok. My round trip flight should have cost me $130. But I ended up spending a total of $270 because they charged me to check my bag twice. They charged me $40 to check my bag from Saigon to Bangkok (a 3 hour layover) and then $57 from Bangkok to Phuket. They said they couldnt let my bag go all the way to Phuket from Saigon for some odd reason.  Do yourself a favor and avoid.,1
2018,Ranchi to New Delhi. Good service. Even though its a lost cost airline but the service was good. Professional staff and well mannered. Aircraft was pretty neat and clean with good aroma through out the journey.,0
2018,"Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur. My last experience with AirAsia was way back in 2012 to Sabah. This time, for a 1 hour flight I could say that I'm quite impressed. Ground service was good, even though I used self check in, staff assisted me in putting on my baggage tag. They redirected me smoothly and was quite helpful when I encountered a problem. This time around, I took this opportunity to survey on ""Allstars"", something which AirAsia is proud about and I wanted to see it for myself. Upon boarding, flight attendant greeted warmly, safety procedures were done (flight attendant did not smile, at least she looks serious), one passenger made a fuss and the stewardess handled it quickly and efficiently. Flight experience was good, take-off was smooth and views were fantastic. Even saw a rainbow for a moment over the clouds! I pre-ordered a meal and when I had some left over, they offered to tapao (take away) for me! Kudos for the Malaysian slang. Had two kids sitting next to me, so I helped them fasten their seatbelts, steward thanked me with a smile(I did not expect that!) Unfortunately, Roki was not working so in flight entertainment is boring. Landing was good, flight on time and had 2 captains for that flight. Overall experience was amazing for an LCC. Highly recommended!",0
2018,"Bangkok to Hat Yai, its a cheap and low cost airline, I have to say the ground staff and the cabin crew was every time really polite and friendly. Of course there are not many amenities or complimentary services but for the price I paid, the only thing which should be improved is the legroom space, this was really narrow, but this was ok for a two hours flight.",0
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Bali. As usual, online check-in for Airasia is available, until the last 24 hours before the flight. Departing to the flight is seamless and ground staff were helpful. When the plane leaving the aerobridge, there were some passengers that still stand at aisle and not on their seat, and pretty sure that is dangerous. During the flight, staff were really friendly and helpful. There were some turbulence during the flight, but no big deal. However, pre-booked meal that I had was terrible. Spiral pasta with sausages was plain and sad. Not recommended.",0
2018,As a low-cost airline AirAsia has no entertainment and food or drink should be paid on the flight. I found the leg space insufficient for a person who is 510 or more. I hope AirAsia provides better services to customers in the near future.,1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Manila. The first flight to Malaysia was fine, no problems. The return to Manila was terrible! I am 6' 2"" and I had no clearance for my knees.  This was not a planned trip. I have been in Philippines for 3 years and had to leave, for a silly rule. and come back again, so it was just a quick trip, away and back. For an international flight the seat configuration was uncalled for.",0
2018,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Self check-in machines are not available across the airport, but it is only available in the Airasia check-in counter section, which requires a bit of walking. This same goes to the boarding gate which is quite far. I hope Airasia could get a better spot of it.",0
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Check-in went well, as there are many self check-in machines in the KLIA2 airport. Boarding was relatively on-time and there was no issue. The best part is when landing in Jakarta, since Airasia is now operating in the new airport where they provide better services.",0
2018,"Very disappointed with Air Asia as a frequent flyer after last experience. Online check-in had errors and glitches which did not allow me to checkin early, charged 40,000 yen at airport. Showed pictures of website glitches and errors, airline does not care or understand. Then I was accidentally tripled charged on my return flight baggage. Had 5 transactions for baggage totaling over $800 USD! My two tickets cost only around $700. Was refunded for some of the excess charges, however such a hassle and online help and calling is very time consuming and stressful and not user friendly. I figured if I provided pictures and explained my problems the airline would understand the online checkin and website had experienced problems and was not working properly. Poor customer service using live chat and submitting cases on issues, just replied back with automated answers. Like talking to a computer. Nobody should have to get charged over $800 USD and worry about 5 charges for 2 small check-in bags, especially unauthorized charges. Very disappointed and will never fly again because of airlines poor recognition of the problem, poor customer service and failure to refund a small cost that should never of happened. Nobody should have to go through that stress while on vacation!",1
2018,"Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. As usual, Air Asia is a serious and comfortable company. The prices are very interesting, I have always used this company for 10 years from Bangkok to different destinations in Asia. I have never known any problems, continue like that, thank you. FR: Comme d'habitude, Air Asia est une compagnie srieuse et confortable.

Je n'ai jamais connu le moindre problmes, continuer comme cela, merci.",0
2018,"Kuala Namu to Kuala Lumpur. As usual, Air Asia always provide smooth experience without any hassle from check-in until departure. However, Airasia is now implemented a strict 7kg policy where cabin baggage has to be strictly only up to 7kg, or else it would be charge expensively.",0
2018,On the 5th June I travelled on Air Asia from Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. The plane was an Airbus 320 and very comfortable. I was able to get a lot of rest during the 3.5 hour flight. I had three seats to myself.,0
2018,On the 21st June I had a flight on Air Asia from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. It was a red eye flight and we arrived around 5am in the morning. I had to clear customs although I had a flight on Air Asia in the evening. The time went very quickly so it must have been a good flight. I was able to stretch out and get some rest.,0
2018,"Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Very good experience, bought the premium flex package and still cheaper than other airline e.g. Cathay Dragon. Also you can enjoy a better flight experience than the traditional airline. The lounge is good too. It is a good place for you the relax.",0
2018,"An hour flight with AirAsia was pretty worth it. Boarding of the plane was smooth. Stewards were really friendly and the pre-booked meal that I had which was Green Thai Curry was okay. But Nasi Lemak and Chicken Rice is way better. Overall, good experience from a low-cost airlines by AirAsia as usual.",0
2018,"My flight with AirAsia was from Singapore to Penang. Boarding was slow but we reached Penang before the scheduled arrival time. Cabin crew were friendly and were eager in helping passengers but they could have shown more warmth by smiling more. Seat was okay. Overall, the flight with AirAsia was a good one.",0
2018,"Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. As what I am expected from AirAsia low-cost airlines, decent service and flight are always present in the whole experience. The time of flight departure is quite accurate. One of the hassle is the flight is getting strict with their 7kg cabin baggage rule. The seat is quite comfy, in comparison with other low-cost airlines. The interior is more vibrant compare to the others. I experienced no turbulence, as what I remember during the flight. Overall, would love to fly with AirAsia again.",0
2018,"Hong Kong to Phuket. I booked the premium flex ticket to get good leg room. I was advised that this type of ticket allowed me to change my flight date at an extra charge.  I needed to change my flight date more than a month before flight date. I tried for days to access my booking on Airasia homepage and when the page finally allowed me to login (I had correct login credentials, the page just didnt work for days) it said I had no booking. Finally I had to call their customer service to have the flight changed instead. At customer support I explained that I needed to change my flight and was told that I had to sit on a standard seat. I asked if it could be solved. They didnt even try to have it sold but just said no. I end up with normal seat instead. I then asked for a refund since I was no longer getting what I paid for. Instead I was asked to pay 1500HKD extra for the change of the flight. I had known about this rule before, but I still asked for compensation due to not getting what I paid for. Also I later found out that if I had booked a new ticket instead of using my return ticket the cost of the new ticket would have been 1700HKD. That is 200HKD more than the fee I had to pay for changing my return ticket, but still several hundred HKD less than what I paid in upgrade for the premium flex ticket I had originally purchased.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Yangon. Flight on time, cabin crew friendly, pre-ordered meal arrived on time and hot, additional purchase prices for beverages are reasonable, pilots are informative, and your seats can recline on this budget airline in the newest aircraft. The fare is also very competitive. I could not ask for more. The only downside is KLIA2, low cost airport which is a shame, but this is not airline's fault.",0
2018,"Kansai to Ho Chi Minh City via KL. Very bad experience with luggage. They wanted to charge me $US 520 for one luggage of 23kg for an air fare of $US148. After arguing with them, brought the weight down to 19kg and coat $330. Will never fly Air Asia again",1
2018,"Miri to Kota Kinabalu by AirAsia. Booking and Check In were easy. Flight departed and arrived on time. Since it was less than an hour flight, flight attendants did not really sell a food on board, meanwhile i really wanted to order. they only served passenger with prebooked meal. However, definitely i will fly AirAsia again.",0
2018,"Went on an overnight flight from Osaka to Don Mueang Bangkok. The staff were lovely. One flight attendant in particular was very cheerful and made everyone laugh (and even applaud) as he sang in Thai over the intercom. Flight attendants are usually a little robotic so it was nice that the whole team seemed to be having fun on this one. I have found AirAsia flights to be very cold, so bring some layers!",0
2018,"Siem Reap to Taipei via Kuala Lumpur. Always check to see if baggage is included. I checked in for my flight online and did not see any information about baggage.  I assumed since I was flying international maybe they would not charge for baggage. I am very aware that they are a budget airline but I did not see a place to purchase baggage while checking in or I would have. I think you must have to pay for baggage when you purchase your ticket. Their staff at the Siem Reap International Airport was unprofessional and very unaccommodating, we are a budget airline is what they kept telling me when I asked why I was being charged for my check-in luggage. The baggage cost me $80 USD, it was only 11kg. The cabin service was just fine.",1
2018,"Jakarta to Denpasar. First time to Bali and bought these tickets on this airline based on price, did not really do any research before hand. The service on this airline was fine, I really had no complaints, the flight left on time, the seats were fine for the short flight that it was and the employees at check in and in the airplane were very nice. My only complaint is that due to my age and bad legs, boarding was done having to go down steps from the terminal to the tarmac and then up the stairs to the airplane. Similar situation upon arriving in Denpasar. Not the end of the world, just that those behind me had to suffer with my lack of speed down and up the stairs.",0
2018,"Chiang Mai to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. We needed to pay close to 4,000 baht just to check in our bag (weighing 23 kg). When we got on the flight the seats were so close together. They expect you to pay for any sort of beverage or snack during the flight- this includes water. On the way back, we decided to try to skip the hidden baggage fees and pay for it online, only we couldn't. Every time we tried to do so, we were met with the warning that their site was experiencing a 'glitch' and that we had to do this at the airport.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Sandakan. I enjoyed my flight. Check in, given KLIA 2 is such a hectic airport, was not too bad. The flight was quite punctual as well. The prepaid food I ordered was quite tasty. Much better in fact then Jetstar. The staff were efficient and helpful as well.",0
2018,"On board you don't get a meal unless you buy it before hand or on board but they will refuse to serve you a glass of water. On the first occasion I have been lucky enough to get a glass of hot water, on the second attempt I have been asked to buy a bottle, but unless you have MYR with you or a credit card you won't be able to get any water. PA s never stop, On one flight i have counted 25 that drive you crazy, trying to get you to buy any sort of things. You can just notice how they save and make money looking at the aircraft: one of them on the inside was covered with advertisements even on the table and the hand luggage compartment. Emergency doors they have two rows of seats on the immediate left and right of them, the so called 'vip seats' where for an extra 20 dollars you have extra leg space. If you are unlucky to seat on row 11 in front of them, your seat will not recline and if you are tall 1.90m like my husband and someone reclines the seat in front of you, you have no space for your legs.",1
2018,"Dont recommend. Originally flight from Jakarta to Singapore was canceled and we were rebooked 5 hours later. Multiple calls to support went unanswered. No response after two days to email ticket created through their support website. No response on Twitter. Service desk at CGK was vacant. Let the ads on the carry-on overhead bins be a signal: this is a bus with wings, so expect all the qualities of a bus company, not an airline.",1
2018,"Bali to Mumbai. My flight supposed to depart at 03.10pm, on 31 March. They allowed passengers to check in at 11.00 am but didn't inform them about the delay. Once the immigration process was completed, then they changed departure time to 07.00pm. Now passengers don't have any option other than waiting. There wasn't any AirAsia executive present at the gate. We also didn't get any vegetarian food at Bali Airport. The airline provided food as it was delayed, but they ordered Non-Vegetarian food only. They should have some common sense that Non-Vegetarian people can eat Vegetarian food, but Vegetarian people cannot eat Non-Vegetarian food. Most of the co passengers were absolutely frustrated. They promised us that they would provide Vegetarian food on the flight. But when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. I really will not recommend this AirAsia to anyone. While going to Bali from Mumbai, one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with AirAsia is different. Generally 1 INR = 210 IDR(app). But with Air Asia, 1 INR = 100 IDR. That was so pathetic. I wanted to choose twin seats while web checkin. The Customer support misguided me. They told me there wasn't any twin seats available in flight so I ended up booking different seats paying equal amount. And actually twin seats were there. This airline is bearable for those whose height is less than 165 Centimeters and a journey of max 3 hours. I will not travel via Air Asia again even if they provide me free tickets. I will not target the inflight entertainment and seating comfort as it is a low cost carrier. We should not expect more from it. It is just a plane which have seats with little cushion onto it. It take off from source and lands at destination. That's all. I hope this review will be valuable for all future travelers.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Bali. My flight supposed to arrive at 23:45, on 31 march they changed it to 12:55am on 1 April and offer a chance to change my flight time within the same date. So I called the customer support and moved it to 10:45am, which took me almost 45 minutes to finish the phone call. It wouldn't bother me until they told me my flight would delay to 14:35 on 30 March. I called to confirm and they told my flight was still the same time. As soon as I arrived KUL airport, I found my flight delayed to 14:35, then I asked them to move my flight to the 12:00 one, they refused my ask cause I didn't change it 48 hours ago according their policy. They changed my flight within 48 hours and ask me to make a change before 48 hours?! The woman in the counter was unwilling to face the sentences stated in the email that If the new flight is inconvenient to you, please contact our Customer Support for either one of the following options: 1. Change your flight to another time/date within 14 calendar days from the original departure date or rquest for a credit account of the value of your booking which is to be redeemed within 90 calendar days from the issuance date for your future travel with us or equest for a full refund of the value of your booking. She said she can call her supervisor but the answer would still be the same. After the call, she said although my supervisor still not agree, I can change your flight. So booking airasia can save a little money but waste time.",1
2018,"Not even a greeting getting on the plane? First time reviewer. The plethora of reviews surrounding this airline do not lie. To save time, let me first list the positives of my flights and then the problem areas. Positives: No delays. Flight arrivals were timely. Unloading was fast. Wifi was available for free. Problems: No staff acknowledgement getting on the plane to any passengers. Did not have Malaysian currency (coming from Vietnam) and was not allowed to pay by credit card so that I could have a bottle of water! Cue tip in the seat pocket from previous flight. Decor is most budget I have seen, carpet does not cover the whole floor of the plane and the stains/tears in the leather seating is obvious. Staff (not all) lacked a positive attitude toward the passengers. The rest is what you would expect from a budget airline i.e. tight, uncomfortable seating, no in-flight entertainment, no complimentary food/beverages, complimentary wifi was limited, no power supply, etc. This is a classic point A to point B service, which was delivered. However, there is budget flying and then there is Air Asia budget flying. Do not recommend.",1
2018,"AirAsia re-schedule my flight in April from Luang Pabrang to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur without prior notice. I try to contact AirAsia for a solution, there is no Singapore contact number. I have to use the e-form to contact them. The response from the Customer Service cannot solve my problem because I cannot accept the new flight schedule. I have requested AirAsia customer service to compensate me for cancelling my tour and my outbound flight because I have to cancel my trip to Luang Pabrang due to Air Asia re-scheduling my in-bound flight. The Customer Service Officer told me she cannot assist me because there is no such policy. I ask to speak to her supervisor and she told me she cannot transfer the call.",1
2018,"My flight timing was changed from 2PM to 8.45AM for 1st of April for Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur.  I was given the option for a full refund if the timing is not right. However I contacted them for the full refund and they never got back to me. I have been frantically trying to contact them via calls, emails, live chat, twitter, facebook since March 1. None of these methods work. There was no reply whatsoever from their customer service. I've tried calling every one of their physical office but none of the numbers work. There is no way to contact them at all.   Seat and aircraft dirty and magazine is never complete. Their budget ticket is quite expensive.",1
2018,"In short an incompetent and very poorly run airline. We caught 4 different flights with air Asia and only 1 ran on time. Delay after delay, said were boarding was at 10.20pm to still not being boarded at 11.15. Booked all my travel with my partner, requested to be seated together. When checking in not sitting together so I had to fork out $100 to choose new seats to sit together, after doing that on our last flight back to Sydney we find out AirAsia have moved our seats again and we are not sitting together. Disgustingly poor form.",1
2018,"Kota Kinabalu to Singapore. I arrived at check in 3 hours before the flight and proceeded to check in. At check in my wife was questioned as she was traveling on a Russian passport and even though we live in Singapore and provided evidence the staff still had a long discussion in Malay about whether to check her in. Eventually they did and they gave us our boarding passes. I  asked if we were all sat together and the check in agent clearly said yes. It wasn't until we got to immigration and i was asked to show our boarding passes when i saw they had my 2 year old daughter sat in a different row to my wife and I. This was very frustrating as it also happened on my flight from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu where the  check in staff told me i had to pay them if we wanted to sit together. I challenged the way the seats were allocated in Singapore to be told that it wasnt anything to do with them it was a computer who allocated seats. Clearly the computer doesn't have a family or doesn't want to sit with its family if it ever travels. The staff were not helpful at all in Singapore, it was only when i got onto the plane and spoke to the cabin crew did we find staff who were helpful and then helped us sort out seats together. On the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore i had to speak to the gate agent who helped us find seats together. I dont understand why Air Asia cause families problems at check in when they can clearly accommodate seats together. Why add extra anxiety and why cause cabin crew or gate staff more problems because the check in staff cant be bothered to help customers? Low cost airlines splitting up families so they can earn extra revenue is being investigated in the UK and the US Senate has stopped airlines splitting families.",1
2018,"Have not be able to register luggage due to downtime of their website. Has taken some weeks to register because of lacking password-updates and similar faults. Wrote e-mail to customer service to change to a later flight and add luggage, since web-site does not work - no answer in over 24 hours. Travel-date is 48 hours after my request, so I have purchased tickets with another airline. In KL there is full immigration, security check and customs at arrival and the same extensive checks on departure - so transit is a few hours hard work. I am 1.80 cm, too much for the allotted space. If you sit at the window, it is difficult to get in contact with the personnel.",1
2018,Flew AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to Manila. The check process at KLIA2 is crazy even if you arrive 2 hours early it's not possible to check into your flight without it being stressful. They require all sorts of crazy info. Automated check in doesn't work. Ended up making it with 5 minutes to spare. I'd arrived at the airport 3 hours earlier. If I'd missed it I guarantee no refund.,1
2018,"Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. I have to commend A*****n for being so helpful towards me for this flight. Service from the AirAsia crew have generally been mediocre in the past but A*****n showed me a different side of the airline  compassion and attentiveness. She assisted me when there was an issue with my boarding pass, going till the extent of walking me to the right person in charge to get things sorted. Thanks A*****n , for changing my perception about AirAsia in general. I hope more of their staff can be as helpful as you.",0
2018,"Flew from Delhi to Srinagar. AirAsia has always been my least preferred airline. Again I regret travelling by this airline. The customer service and support is zero. I needed to take a medicine and asked for water by pressing the Assistance button above our seat. The air hostess came and asked me what I needed, I said water. Then very conveniently she forgot that. I mean do they teach them the meaning of that button? Very unfortunate that such a big name has such poor quality service. Thank you for giving me another reason as to why I am definitely not going to travel AirAsia again.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. When I was planning the trip to Langkawi, AirAsia offered the cheapest tickets. So the price was the main factor while choosing AirAsia and I must say it was really good value for money. I checked in online and everything was really easy. At the airport we had to wait about 15 minutes in the queue for the bag drop, but that was totally normal. Boarding process was well-organised. The staff on-board was very kind and helpful. The legroom was quite short for me, but as the flight took only one hour, it was easily bearable. In conclusion, it was really good decision to take AirAsia for such a short flight, as their price was unbeatable and they offer really good variety of services for additional cost, which are very convenient.",0
2018,"Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. he plane left the boarding gate 5 minutes behind schedule and took off 17 minutes later. Take off was smooth and the flight was fine all the way to KUL, except for a few minor bumps along the way.",0
2018,"Puerto Princesa to Manila. We have now been flying with this airline 3 times, and two of these times we had delays for around 1 hour. When flying back from Puerto Princesa we were asked to check in what had been our carry on baggage going here. The bags weights were less than 10 kilos, soft, full of clothes, and size is according to normal standards for airlines and our previous flights with air Asia. When we asked for the reason they told its due to safety reason.  So we had to pay the check-in fee and board.",1
2018,"Yogyakarta to Kuala Lumpur. First time with AirAsia and it was quite satisfactory. Waited in line for about 20 minutes at Jogja to check in, but the line moved fairly quickly. My hand luggage was over 7kg so I bought extra baggage allowance, but the ground staff at Jogja never weighed my hand luggage. Boarding started at departure time so we got off the group 30 minutes late, but we arrived on time at KUL. Crew was attentive. Seats were reasonably comfortable. Announcements were frequent and easy to understand. Overall I was satisfied with this AirAsia flight.",0
2018,"Yogyakarta to Jakarta. Everything is okay, the legroom may be limited for people with height more 175 cm. If you want more spacious legroom buy emergency seat. Free baggage 15 kg for Indonesia domestic flight. Overall okay, especially as they have various pre-order meal with reasonable price (same with fast food price).",0
2018,"Ho Chin Minh City to Kuala Lumpur. Bad to worse from the start because I had a renewed passport (even though I showed them the old passport). On the return leg from KUL to SGN, whilst boarding I was pulled out of line, both the old and new passports taken off me (which I eventually demanded back). The staff checking boarding passes was suspicious of anyone handing her a smartphone boarding pass. What's the point of using the AirAsia App if we get dirty looks when using it for storing boarding passes? Anyway, her supervisor contacted his supervisor using WhatsApp then after sending pictures of my passports to him, I was finally allowed to board.  After boarding, the flight attendants serving food want to see your boarding pass, which means if you have it on your phone (and you are sat at a window seat) you have to pass it to be inspected.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumput to Denpasar. Our flight was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and ATC tech issues. AirAsia informed us about the first delay on 11:30pm the day before our 7:45am flight, while this could have happened faster I was still able to adapt to it. After boarding we waited an other 60 min with very sparse information about why, roughly in the middle of wait we were informed that there are problems with ATC and at some point later we pushed back without further announcements. The seats were fine but had little comfort.  No IFE or WIFI available. AirAsia is fine for the price if everything works, if you have a problem you have a big one. Our return flight was rescheduled and offered to refund or rebook. I tried to rebook. To me the saving on airfare is not worth the very real possibility that you will spend a lot of energy and time being stressed by AirAsia messing up.",1
2018,"Kuala Lumpur to Phuket delayed arrival of 45 minutes. I used this airline for the first time, with 4 flights in January and every flight was delayed, the one from Bali to Kuala Lumpur was a 3 hour delay. Rubbish time keeping.",1
2018,"The new seats were very small and not very comfortable. The old seats for the old A320-200 were a bit bigger and a bit more comfortable. For some reason the day I flew was a very nice day to fly but for some reason the turbulence was very extreme, the pilot had to cancel the distribution of meals because of it which I believe was not turbulence, it was the pilot using the plane on manual instead of using the autopilot. The flight was 50 minutes delayed but somehow made it 10 minutes late to its actual arrival time. I was happy for that but other than that it was the worst AirAsia experience. Note: The ticket was very cheap.",1
2018,Flew from Surat Thani to Bangkok Don Mueang for business. Booked for luggage and thus had a hot seat and also a meal. The service was standard Air sia and standard budget airlines. The staff members were polite as how usually budget airlines goes. Seat pitch at my seat (1D) was pretty OK. However I still cannot imagine taking budget airlines for long haul flights.,0
2018,"Flew Johor to Kuala Lumpur. Flight delayed 3 hours 25 mins. No advance notice given the day before. Very bad experience with AirAsia, poor service, not recommended. No compensation offered on flight delayed.",1
2018,"Flew Kota Bharu to Kuala Lumpur. Air Asia have made a lot of improvements especially in terms of punctuality. Staff were friendly. They even took the initiative to wish one of the passengers a happy birthday through an announcement. Cabin was clean, flight was on time and more importantly super value for money. The only thing lacking is probably inflight entertainment - but you dont really need it for such a short distance journey.",0
2018,Singapore to Bali. Have taken many flights with Airasia which have been largely positive. My last experience I arrived late (20 minutes before departure) and was prepared to be refused to board the plane. I was surprised to have to pay 3X my original fare to buy a later flight.  I could have made my original flight had I been allowed to proceed without issue initially as I had no baggage to check in etc. Extremely disappointed.,1
2018,"Vientiane to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok. Worst flight experience I ever had. The only reason I went to the check in counter at my first leg of the flight was to see whether I was correctly checked-in since I booked through a 3rd operator. Showed my boarding pass on my phone, that was all fine, and then they gave me a paper boarding pass. While boarding, I showed my boarding pass on my phone, as I had put my paper boarding pass away, they acted like I was from another world having a boarding pass on my phone. They took me out of line, saying paper boarding pass all taking my pasport out of my hands. Then at my stopover, I couldn't transfer like I normally would on connecting flights, because my boarding pass had to be verified.  Really inconvenient to say the least, almost missed my connecting flight because of it.",1
2018,Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. We booked 6 months before and we got a very good price lower than many others. True that you need to pre-book your meals and baggage allowance. But all went smoothly. The quality of their service is very satisfactory! However selling food and Duty free items on board is bit unprofessional.,1
2018,"I bought tickets for Kuala Lumpur to Penang return. At Penang airport I reached check in 30 minutes before flight time. However, they refused to let me board and simply said I had to purchase tickets with their next flight as gates are closed. The money I had paid for the flight was wasted and I was forced to purchase another one way ticket to KL from the airport with Malindo Air. I could understand if it was an international flight, but the fact that they refused to allow me to board with 30 minutes remaining is unacceptable.",1
2017,"Flew Kochi to Hyderabad. Worst customer service ever experienced. Flight got delayed for 3 hours and delay was notified after the actual departure time by SMS. When I checked with the AirAsia desk about the delay, they didn't even seem to know that the flight was delayed 3 hours. I dont want to travel with AirAsia again.",1
2017,We had a trip from Kochi to Ho chi Minh with 1 stop to Kuala Lumpur. Both of our flights were delayed. The first one for over 1 hour and the second for over 3 hours. The seats inside the aircraft are small. We ordered something to eat inflight and most things on the catalogue were missing and the food was very little for one person and the cabin staff didn't have enough change to give you back. I will not travel with this airline again for sure.,1
2017,"Flight was cancelled due to the Bali volcano situation. My flight was several days after the 1st sign of eruption, no updates were provided on the potential cancellation. I was notified a few hours prior to the departure. No proper communication on how to seek refunds. I had to do my own research to find out how to get the refund. After I made the submission, I had to contact them more than 4 times in the past 21 days with no updates. On 3 out of the 4 occasions, the customer service staff I chatted to ended the conversation abruptly without a conclusion. To hang up while someone is talking is very unprofessional. Their website couldn't find my refund status record too. During the Bali volcano eruption period, Jetstar offered their affected customers an alternative flight to another Jetstar destination.  AirAsia was silent throughout this period.",1
2017,"Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur. I have no words to express my severe disappointment in this airline and will never fly with them again. They have no concept of customer service, experience or satisfaction.",1
2017,"Perth to Denpasar Bali booked for 2nd December. Waited on hold the day before flight was cancelled to be told your flight tomorrow will depart as scheduled. Needless to say flight didn't go anywhere. I asked air Asia on the phone if there was any way that I could fly from my original departure city (Perth) - to anywhere in Asia within two weeks - was told no that is not possible by the most useless manager. Offered to change my flight to some time within 28 days to Bali (original route). After arguing for a refund for over two hours, I was offered no refund. Two days later AirAsia release a statement that they're going to offer everyone who bought tickets for this flight full refunds. 17 days, 3 emails, 3 phone calls, 2 Facebook conversations later, and several failed attempts to use the down for maintenance Air Asia app and website, I still have no refund.",1
2017,Singapore to Bangkok. My luggage was damaged. Counter at the airport was closed as there were no more flights from AirAsia. Wasted an hour on the phone trying to contact their customer service and received forms to fill up for the to even begin processing my request. The hoops you have to jump though in order to get a token refund from this airline is appalling. I found out that they have removed their review feature from their Facebook page.,1
2017,"We were travelling from Krabi to Jakarta, via Bangkok and when we arrived to Jakarta our luggage didn't arrive. We reported it lost at the CBTO office, they told us our bag was left behind in Bangkok and that they were going to send it back to Jakarta the next day at 3pm. We were flying back to the US next day so we couldn't claim it. It has been already 3 days since they got our luggage at CGK airport and they haven't done anything to get it back to us. We've been calling them many times and they either don't answer their calls or when they answer they hang up on us or they require us to provide a report ID number from the airline we flew back home so they can handover the bag to them. But, it's not that other airline's fault and because they don't have my luggage they can't give us a report ID number. It's not our fault, it should be the airline's responsibility to send the luggage to us. It has been a nightmare trying to get them send our luggage. Very inefficient staff in Jakarta. They don't respond to our emails and don't say anything about what they'll do with the luggage.",1
2017,"Bangkok to Chiang Mai. After boarded it was announced we need to get off and take another plane. This is the second time I have used AirAsia and a second unpleasant experience with them. First time was getting charged $140 for my first and only luggage at the airport, its only around 10kg.",1
2017,Ranchi to Kolkata. They only serve food to passengers that have done the required preibooking of meals and that's it. In a short flight like this Indigo cabin crew will sell food and water apart from pre booked passengers.  This is my last time.,1
2017,"Singapore to Bali. First and last time traveling with this airline. We paid double the fare to board ourselves to a later flight in the day due to arriving late at airport. The check-in staff assured us to board us onto the next flight. The price difference is nothing short of predatory pricing. AirAsia insists on an all-in tix plus luggage overweight charges, airport taxes and everything else. Fine, we did as per their recommendation and waited 2 hours to the ""next flight"". But the airline delays an extra 2 hours (this is only a 2 hours flight) and our first day of the vacation is almost over. Do yourself a favor and book Tiger/Scoot next time.",1
2017,"Penang to Bangkok via Medan with Air Asia Indonesia. This was my second worst flight experience ever. It is absurd that they do not offer Fly Thru service for International flight connections. It is absurd how small the pitch is between seats. It is absurd they will fill up an A320, with no one in the exit rows because that costs extra, and kick a passenger who relocated there during the flight, how many advertisements are in the plane and that after collecting our baggage and passing through customs, simply to catch a connecting flight, the Checkin Agent insisted I pay cash for an outrageous overweight bag fee because he didn't feel like entering my credit card information into the computer. This is 2017, I can pay anyone for lunch with Venmo, but paying a major airline for a fee is difficult? Are you kidding me? It is absurd they woke me up to hand me a meal which I did not order, only to realize that the meal was for someone else, so they took the meal away.  Wifi on plane? Advertised but doesn't work. Seat entertainment? Not on any planes. T",1
2017,"Shantou to Bangkok. With my knowledge having boarded AirAsia I simply lowered my expectation of inflight service to zero. Beautiful flight attendants were there greeting me. The plane took off as scheduled. The meal plan I pre-booked is served at a comfortable pace. They were using 2 flight attendants, one is to do everything and another is just to stand there and hand out the food. I have no idea whether it is the best way of serving on board but I see many flight attendants who are serving passengers more actively. They refused my Chinese money once I ordered a can of coke. I have given them 14RMB, the flight attendant returned me with 2RMB and said it is too old. As a passenger I can't the control or reject the legal money given to me from a supermarket, can I? Can they refuse legal bank notes?",1
2017,I flew on Air Asia from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi on November 9th 2017. Everything on this trip was excellent. Refreshments were available for purchase. Boarding was handled efficiently aided by the new design at terminal KLIA2. Was given seat 1B as the flight was full and I did not have to pay extra for boarding first.,0
2017,"Bali to Phnom Penh via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. In Kuala Lumpur there was a delay of more than 2 hours. Staff and company gave zero information about the delay. Moved to another gate, waiting for another flight to arrive and than just before boarding gave us a bottle of water, for over 2 hours of waiting. Even a meal does not compensate this delay. AirAsia is a budget airline with next to no service. Booked my ticket online and they charged me 10% for using my debit card, $48. Ridiculous. This amount does not show before you agree to pay. Do not fly. I prefer a regular airline.",1
2017,"Taipei to Kuala Lumpur. I would like to compliment one of the staff at TPE check-in counter. He exhibit professional customer service in handling customer case by case. He portray the mission of AirAsia, low cost and high quality. He repeatedly provide options for customers with patient.  I would like to thanks him for making my journey with AirAsia a pleasant one.",0
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya with AirAsia Indonesia. It was a morning flight from KUL to SUB. The flight took off lakte about 20 minutes. The senior flight attendant apologised for the delay. Weather during take-off was cloudy. Generally, the flight was pleasant all the way to Surabaya. Landing was okay.",0
2017,Bali to New Delhi via Kuala Lumpur.  No inflight entertainment and no free food given on flight. One has to pay. They defend that position by calling themselves a budget airline. Seats are uncomfortable. I'm  going to pay extra and travel with some other airline next time. The positives are that the staff is courteous and the flight is on time always. In fact they're before time.,1
2017,"My wife and I just returned from a trip to the Maldives on flights FD 177 and FD 178 (Bangkok  Male) on 26 Oct and 31 Oct and I must say they were the worst flights we have ever experienced. We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldnt a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for express handling. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1  hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority  everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal. So I ask you, would you put up with this type of service when paying premium fares for so-called better service?",1
2017,"I flew with AirAsia 6 timea this past 2 weeks, not a single flight was on time. There was zero courtesy shown by staff to the peaple they are delaying. The airline showed zero responsibility towards people with connecting flights on the same airline or other airlines. I hated every minute with them. All this while forgetting it was not really a budget choice nor was there any added value for the cost.",1
2017,"Flew Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia are cheap, but that's all they have going for them. The experience I have with them is as follows: Deceptive - they add lots of charges and it's hard to navigate their online system to avoid the extra fees. Website crashes - as said above, their site is 'tricky' to navigate. I think it's deliberate, to trick you into buying extras you don't want and to gain revenue from inadvertent double bookings of flights. Customer service - there is none of this at AirAsia. None. Ziltch. I asked for help and they arrogantly didn't listen, instead just threw 'policy' or 'rules' at me. There is no compassion, no fairness, nothing. Just everything their way. They won't even provide an escalation process if unhappy with their ruling. Unfair and unjust. Small seating - the seats are too small for taller people. I hate that. I will never book an Air Asia ticket again. Instead, I'll go Scoot or Jetstar - these companies have a heart and actually care about service.",1
2017,"AirAsia needs to step up its game! Flying from Penang to Kuala Lumpur so many times and most of the time the flight is always delayed by an hour plus. Same thing happened again this time, another delay by an hour plus. This is a joke, I have other flight to catch and life to live. The ticket price gets more expensive but service is non-existent. You are being hauled and hushed quickly by the staff and the prided best customer service is a joke. Not consistent and hard to get. Overprice F&B, seat selection and old entertainment and uncomfortable seating arrangement. I will go with a full service carrier in the future!",1
2017,"I flew from Kalibo heading to Kuala Lumpur via AK609 on 14.25pm - 24 Oct 2017. Before boarding, I caught a fever. I asked for panadol from the crew and they were very responsive providing me with the medicine together with hot water. I had pre-ordered the in-flight meal of coconut rice and they were very kind to offer to help me change to a sandwich in order for me to eat the sandwich before taking the medicine. They came around offering me hot water from time to time. In conclusion, we really enjoyed the personalized service and value for money despite this being a budget airline. The cabin crew were friendly and very helpful.",0
2017,"Among the worse airline in all respects. Terrible website, non-existent customer service, indifferent staff, horrible oily food and constant delays on most domestic and regional flights. And it has been getting worse with each passing year. Hardly remember a domestic flight in Malaysia which departed or reached on time.",1
2017,"Kansai to Kuala Lumpur. During my trip to Japan, I got news that my dad who lived in Indonesia suddenly got sick, he passed away few days later. I needed to leave Japan quicker than planned. Contacted AirAsia and they didnt have any availability anymore on the day, but promised to give credit or somekind of proportioned refund for the original ticket, so long I provided all the documents requested. Which I did, I sent all the hospital letter and death certificate. Now 2 months later and still no response from the airline, I tried to contact the by email a few times already. Bad customer service.",1
2017,"Air Asia 11.35 flight from Bangalore to Delhi is delayed for the second consecutive time we have used them. All the time they give same reason, incoming aircraft delayed. Fed up with this airline, would be better changing the flight time to stop wasting passengers time.",1
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Thiruchillapali. This is the first time I have experienced bad service by air Asia, and it happened in their KL terminal 2.  My wife booked a ticket for me to go to India via KL, but she booked it under my nick name because domestically in the Philippines I travel under that name. The ticket we bought however does allow passenger name change, but there is a fine print which is a total con. The chat service and customer support just kept throwing us back and forth and finally when we pushed they promised that it will be refunded we just have to buy another ticket for the moment. Well this happened December 2016. Till now no answer, just a template answer saying no refund because the name is different. To me, I don't care about the money it's a small issue. I still fly air Asia when there is no other airline available for the price and time, but if there is a better airline, I take that instead.",1
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. AirAsia always gave me a good journey to reach my destination, but one thing i dislike about the airline is the lack of inflight entertainment. I know its a low cost airline but that doesn't mean that they can't implement inflight entertainment. The  seats are small espeically the leg room,  but they are uncomfortable and quite disappointing.",0
2017,It was a morning flight departing KUL at 8:20AM and arriving DMK at 9:30AM. Flight departed and arrived on time. Proper announcements were made by the cabin crew and the pilots. Cabin crew on this flight were pretty active. Aircraft had a special livery (Allstars Livery)(reg no 9M-AFD). Interior of the aircraft was pretty worn out and the aircraft had started to show its age. Did not pre-order anything or buy onboard anything.,0
2017,AirAsia charges its passengers for practically everything that it possibly can. Did web check-in 14 days prior but could not select seat of my wish free of charge. Was alloted a seat by the system randomly. The ground service at Bhubaneswar airport was pathetic with the airline staff not clear about the transit rules. There was no line at check-in counter and people were literally crowding at the counters to get their check-in done. flight departed 15 mins late but arrived on schedule. The staff were a little cold on this flight. Did not have any issue with seat pitch (my height is 164cms). The pilot made periodic announcements regarding flight progress which was nice. Had pre-ordered kabali biryani which was served with coke. Quantity of the meal was fine.,0
2017,"I bought a ticket Padang - Kuala Lumpur in february 2017 for a flight in August. With this flight we had 6 hours in Kuala Lumpur to catch the other flight. After a month I a got a message of a reschedule for about two hours later. It still should be enough for the transfer in Kuala Lumpur. On the day of departure when we arrived at the ariport a next reschedule of the flight. This means about two hours for transer. This is very tight for a transer in Kuala Lumpur, due to the two different terminals. We informed the AirAsia staff, they arranged a Priority luggage handling. The man took a picture of our passport and ticket and send it to Kuala Lumpur to inform the office there and probably inform the Oman Air counter, our connecting carrier. Finally, at the gate we waited for three hours to found out that the flight was delayd for almost an hour! The plane had a fast and smooth trip to Kuala Lumpur. At arrival we ran to the luggage band, picked up our luggage as first and run to the next terminal. At the second terminal we found out that the connecting flight of Oman-Air has left already.  The result was that I had to buy 4 new tickets to Amsterdam. Back home filling in the e-form and ask for help or compensation. But the only response of Air Asia, sorry we are not responsible. We can not be charged for costs due to delay or rescheduling. This means that you cannot trust AirAsia if you have a connecting flight. If you cannot trust the schedule you better don't fly with AirAsia.  Im sorry because the flight and onboard service is okay. The lesson is that a cheap ticket can turn to be very expensive.",1
2017,"I was travelling from Bali to Hong Kong, where I had to transfer at KL. I only had a cabin size suitcase, and a drawstring backpack with me. I have been travelling with AirAsia many times in the past, due to the it's competitive price, even though the seats are uncomfortable, but I don't mind it for short hauls. I have always been using the same cabin size suitcase when travelling with them. So size wise, I know my suitcase is definitely fine. For my drawstring backpack, anyone who has one knows you can't really put much in it. I only had my personal documents in the bag, plus a jacket to use while on the flight. After I finished checking in, a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. The total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg (the total permitted weight is 7kg for AirAsia). This is exactly what I came with, perhaps less. I threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. They weighed my luggage on my outward flights, I can't remember the total weight for that, but they let me through, but gave me a little advice to make sure I was within limit the next time. However, on my return flight, this guy did not let me through, he took my boarding pass away, even when I told him I was running late, I only had less than 10min left before boarding time! He said I had to check in my suitcase. So I had to quickly rearrange things in my suitcase again! After all this messing around, my suitcase was finally ready for checking it, and I was charged IDR 800k for that! My flight was only IDR 1,380,400! I could have pay a little bit more, and flew with Cathay, which comes with 20kg check-in luggage, a much comfier journey with entertainment, plus direct flight. What really annoyed me was that after I went to the other side at the boarding gate, I saw so many people with over-sized luggage. I spoke to 2 staff there to make a complaint, but they ignored me. As soon as I landed, I sent an email to AirAsia to make this complaint, there were a lot of emails back and forth, but they were not willing to do anything about it. I'm fine if they want to follow their rules strictly, but please make sure it's consistent.",1
2017,"This was AirAsia, AK356, an afternoon flight from Kuala Lumpur to Surakarta. The flight departed on time and arrived at Adi Soemarmo International Airport 20 mins ahead of schedule.

2017,"This was flight AK329 from Semarang to Kuala Lumpur, a morning flight which departed 10 mins behind schedule. The captain made a flight-related announcement after attaining cruising altitude.

2017,"Our booking from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu was for 17h30, got email that delay until 19.30. Checked in 16.30 and went to departure area. By 19h00 notification of another 1hr delay. 20h45 no official communication but flight staff member informed us that entire flight crew for our flight had been rerouted to another flight. All AirAsia staff disappeared and at 21h00 an announcement over public address system informed us that flight was delayed until 02h40. At customer service cubical in departues there was one AirAsia person with a queue of at least 50 customers waiting to be served. We then went home, no point staying in KK for 30 hrs as our return flight was at 15h00 on Sunday",1
2017,"One of our passengers wanted to upgrade to the Emergency Upgrade Seats. For two days before the actual travel date we could neither reach the AirAsia listed telephone no, nor could we re-login. After boarding the flight we saw a vacant seat and offered to pay but we were not allowed. Same thing happened on the way back from Bali. Neither the online check-in works nor the telephone no. Customer Service is non-existent. There is no AirAsia counter in KL Airport for the service of en route passengers. Even water is not served, which is being too stingy. The A320s flying to India are too cramped. On the way back from Bali to KL, we were unfortunate to get the last row seats. besides the constant sound of the toilet flush, the Cabin Crew, who did not have much work, were chatting away at the top of their voices like excited school children. Flights were late by minimum 1 hour on all four legs. Overall one of the lousiest flights that we have travelled. No professionalism at all.",1
2017,Hong Kong to Male via Kuala Lumpur. Horrible experience with AirAsia.  We suffered a delay of 2 hours so we lost the conexion flight and after long time and queues we were re-scheduled 24 hours later. We were provided a horrible hotel voucher and received very poor attention.,1
2017,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The flight departed late, I had to wait about an hour. There was a technical difficulty, it seemed. The announcement about the delayed departure was made at the airport about 30 minutes before departure, and through email, which surprised me since the email was received shortly before the originally scheduled flight should have left. The flight went well.",0
2017,"Bandung to Kuala Lumpur. The check in was fair, but I asked to pay the baggage fee - I didn't know that the ticket fare I bought online was not covering baggage. The airport boarding room in Bandung was not too big, some passengers were standing. The flight delayed for 30 minutes. The ground staff didn't arrange the queue according to the seat area, so people started to queque 30 minutes before call. I was not aware about pre meal order and decided not to order on board. The seat space was enough for me, maybe near emergency exit was wider. For low cost flight, I think I would recommend AirAsia.",0
2017,"AirAsia is by far the worst airline experience I've ever had. I had four AirAsia flights in the last week for my trip to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and Penang and back to Changsha) three of which were delayed. The ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. The chairs are quite uncomfortable, when it was time for landing, I didn't even realize my seat was reclined. Many of the passengers used their cell phones at inappropriate times which made me very uncomfortable. I would rather pay for a more expensive flight than take AirAsia again.",1
2017,"Hanoi to Bangkok. They offer cheap flights, but tack on a bunch of other costs. I tried to get the website to allow me to select baggage but it did not work. When I tried to call the phone number they provide for the Vietnam office, it did not go through. As a result, I was charged 40USD to check a 15kg bag. The staff was rude and unaccommodating.  This may just be a problem with Air Asia in Hanoi. Aside from the booking process. They do not provide free water (let alone snacks) on flights as a low-cost airline.",1
2017,"Cengkareng to Denpasar. I am quite dissapointed with the service of Air Asia, they are not punctual with the schedule. Although they are cheap, they gave us poor service. On 7th July passengers were asked to proceed to the plane by bus. However, we were asked to stay in the bus for 30 minutes and asked to go back to the waiting room until further notice. Today, 4th August, using the same route, I experienced delay for my 21.00 flight. I just want to assure that cheap flights cannot degrade its service and punctuality, because, next time, I will rather use other airline (even more expensive one) in order to fly on time.",1
2017,"Penang to Langkawi. s overall a good experience, Check in was a little confusing as you have to label your own bags. There was a staff member on hand to assist if needed though. The line was a bit long and slow, Boarding was so organised, everyone had a line to be in which was according to seat number, very efficient, The plane seemed new, the seats were very comfortable, it was a very short flight yet it was surprising sine had ordered food however it wasn't served due to turbulence which was a surprise as we felt none, It was a nice flight and now I am seriously considering Air Asia for future flights - it was much nicer than the Malaysia Airlines domestic flights,",0
2017,"Check-in line management was extremely slow, that it took over an hour and 10 minutes to get to the counter. There was an unintelligible announcement that was later claimed by the airline as last minute check-in announcement. I was denied check-in more than 45 minutes before the flight time, when the boarding pass clearly said that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure time, for a delay caused by the airline's poor line management. I was not offered the option to pay a chhange fee. Instead, I had to pay the price difference for a same day flight, which was between as much as I had paid for the whole trip, up to double that. This has been the worst customer service I have received from any airline, anywhere, and I travel a lot. Will never fly this airline again, nor recommend it.",1
2017,"Yogyakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Flight departed on time and touched down Kuala Lumpur 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin was very clean despite the rather short turn-around of 20 or so minutes.

As with most of AirAsia flights: very good value for money and overall good level of service in the air and on the ground.",0
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Mal return. My very first flight AK 72 was considerably okay but the return was terrible. Both female flight attendants were rude, discourteous when they served the food.

The male attendants were nice and were trying to do a good job.",1
2017,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The boarding was chaotic but still effective, the only problem is using 1 gate for 3 flights. This flight arrived early and the food is ok. The seat pitch is tight but considering the price paid it is okay. Some of the crew is not so friendly but overall it is quite good.",0
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Krabi. We booked our flights online, and our reservation was changed by Airasia without notice. They changed the time of the flights, changed the bagages allowances, etc. That caused a big problem at Male airport in Maldives where the staff was especially not collaborating and unfriendly. We have big the victimes of their unfair online system as still had to pay the price for this. Booking on Airasia is like playing russian roulette. I started my trip at Krabi airport where my 22 kg bag was accepted as a 20 kg check in bag. Then the same bag wasn't accepted in Kuala Lumpur and I have to waste 10 minutes and make the queue even worst to take out things from my bag. On the way back from the trip, same problem at the Cebu airport. You can take 25 kg ++ carry on bags without paying a check in bag while people like me who try to respect the check in system are just treated rudely for 2 kg in excess.",1
2017,"This is my return flight from Labuan to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia pride themselves as a low cost airline and indeed the fares are very low. However, yet another delayed flight.

2017,Singapore to Kuala lumpur. Worst budget airline flights I have taken the ground staff and cabin crew were rude.  Not consistent with safety checks. Some people where allowed to continue to use their phones some were watched whilst they turned them off.,1
2017,"Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia's well-known low-cost airline with technically unbeatable fares, which is really like a local bus service. My flight was smooth, check-in for domestic flights is also possible at self check-in kiosks, so it saved a lot of time. Seats were a bit tightly packed and if you didn't order meal or not planning to buy duty-free stuff, there is no contact between you and the crew. Basic flight experience, but highly recommended for anyone, who does not require sumptuous conditions for travel.",0

Now, my last flight to come back to Singapore is announced on last minute with more than 1h 30mins delay, supposing a technical issue. Staff disappeared and screen even not updated. This is a poor experience and the lower one I have experienced in Asia. Does it worth to waste time and money when again in theory you caught a good ticket fare.",1
2017,Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. I have to say this was the worst travel experience I have had. We bought our fares through an online booking service rather than the airline. On the way there it was bought as one package i.e. one flight to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur then connecting flight to Ho Chi Minh City and we also bought a package of 2 flights for the way back the exact same way online. When arriving at Sydney no problem for the airline staff to print us both boarding passes for the Kuala Lumpur flight and also the Ho Chi Minh City flight at the same time. On the way back different story. They said that these were two separate flight bookings that our online booking service had made for us. So in KL we then had to go through all their security and customs and then check our bags again and this took us about 1.5 hours. Many times I have brought my own decaf coffee with me on the plane as airlines never serve decaf coffee and I don't drink caffeine. I usually just ask them if I can have a cup of boiling water with some milk and I add my own decaf coffee.  I got told by a very nice air hostess that she would give me the hot water and milk (powdered) for free and that if I asked on another flight for this that I might be told to pay for a drink. There is no in flight entertainment and meals are not free as a low-cost airline. When you  pay for a meal on the plane you must pay in Malaysian currency or credit card. Then if you don't have credit card you can't purchase anything. Fortunately I had some US dollars in cash and they made a quick conversion and I paid in that for my items.,1
2017,"Flew with AirAsia from Denpasar Bali to Yogyakarta and back. Both times were delayed, one by 2hrs one by 35mins and I did not receive any notification of this delay.

2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. There are so many check-in counters in KL airport that it was not easy to find the right one and then it took about 50 minutes in the queue. The flight was delayed for about 1 hours. As bought value pack I was given a small bottle of water and small sandwich. In addition I bought a seat near exit row, so I felt comfortable and I think it worth the money paid. There was some inflight magazines in English. It's a low cost airline and it it's under 100$ it'd be a good choice.",0
2017,"The AirAsia flight from Padang to Kuala Lumpur was delayed and arrived late. We had to wait an extra hour. The boarding was done quite quickly as the plane wasn't full.

2017,It was a morning flight from Kuala Lumpur to Padang with AirAsia. The flight took off a bit late but arrived on time. The flight was quite full but everything was done in an orderly fashion. The flight went well and did not encounter turbulence nearly all the way. Landing was smooth.,0
2017,"It was an early night flight from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was nearly full, and boarding commenced early and was efficiently conducted. The plane was able to leave the terminal building early but because of numerous aircraft waiting to take-off, departure was behind schedule. The flight was smooth almost all the way except a few minor turbulence in mid-air. Take-off and landing was good.",0
2017,"I first bought the upgrade pass in 2015 via Air Asia site and I purchased 6 upgrades to business class for more than the amount if you go directly to optiontown and request a non guaranteed upgrade but I thought the guaranteed one was worth the extra money. I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money. On the pass they only give you useless 'credits' which you will never use in the limited time period.",1
2017,"AirAsia offer four flights a day to Singapore from Bali Indonesia. Unfortunately it is difficult to rely on any flight time as they have started consolidating flights to fill planes. My booking for the earliest flight was to allow time to take my daughter to Singapore for her 21st birthday. First flight in, last flight out would give us 12 hours in singapore. 2 days before the flight to Singapore AirAsia resheduled it, ok fair enough, it was only by 2 hours. But then 6 hours before the flight they rescheduled it again by 3 hours. Then to add insult to injury the rescheduled flight was also delayed by 50 minutes. We finally got to Singapore but our entire whole day shopping trip turned into only 3 hours. Why offer such an extensive array of flights you have no intention to fulfil? AirAsia have lost all credibility",1
2017,"Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia has to be one of the all around worst airlines I have ever flown. I don't write reviews, this is the first. I travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. It takes a little effort to get me annoyed. Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others. Maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where I come from, but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. Being kind, courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. Unfortunately, there is no recourse for me. They don't care. They are so big, it will be hard to avoid them in the future, but I'll will do my best to use other airlines.",1
2017,"A good flight from Surabaya to Johor Bahru return. No delay at all (arrive earlier). It is better to prebook food, but price onboard is still fair. The aircraft cabin is clean and the cabin crew was so attentive. I got separate seat from Johor to Surabaya, crew know about it and give me permission to change to my family in hot seat (front row). I really appreciate it.",0
2017,"Jakarta to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala Lumpur. We've been on Air Asia and its subsidiaries a few times, mostly enjoyable, no nonsense and good value for money, so was this flight. One unpleasant experience on this particular flights; we were separated between KUL-SGN due to full flight - apparently and was advised to see ground staff at transfer desk KLIA2, where there was no help. We went to the boarding gate and they gave us 31B/31 C at the back of the plane. Once onboard, it wasn't a full flight, there are plenty of seats available. AirAsia system obviously cannot see that it was a single booking for two pax, hence they do not allocate seats for two.",1
2017,"This Bandung - Kuala Lumpur flight was a morning flight. It arrived in Husein Sastranegara Airport on time but departed 10 mins late. The plane encountered mild turbulence on the early and later part of the flight, but generally it was smooth. Landing was okay in KUL. Arrival was on time. This time I ordered the satay wrap, and it was succulent.",0
2017,"This was a morning flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The flight was nearly full and departure was not as scheduled, it was at most 10 mins. late. The flight was generally smooth, and landing was good. Even though we departed late, the plane arrived on time. This time, I didn't ordered any food as I remembered my bad experience with the food on my last flight.",0
2017,"Flew AirAsia from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur. I have flown with Airasia for a year now and I travel often. Their customer service is the worst, its really hard to contact them. Online there is over an hour wait and there are always issues. AirAsia tries to charge for everything it can think of, even for making a payment. Cheap, but not worth all the trouble.",1
2017,"Ho Chi Minh City to Penang. This was a very straightforward flight experience with an easy check, boarding, flight and landing. As it's a budget airline you don't expect any frills but the experience was fine all the way through. We'd paid extra so we got express boarding (more so we can be sure to get overhead luggage space beside our seats). No complaints at all. Good value for money.",0
2017,"Seoul to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia has terrible customer service and tries to overcharge passengers at every turn. I purchased 2 25 kg checked bags, but at check in, they claimed I had only purchased one, which resulted in by baggage being 11 kg over the weight allowance that I purchased. They then offered to check the remainder of my luggage for 42,000 won per kg, or 1.5 times the cost of my original ticket. They wanted 640,000 won for my 11 kg of checked luggage which they falsely claimed that I had not purchased. I am never flying AirAsia again.",1
2017,Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. A really nice and comfortable flight. I've also noticed that AirAsia arrives earlier or on-time despite being delayed for half an hour. The cabin crew was really friendly. Thus this shuts all my negative views towards them before. I would fly with AirAsia again.,0
2017,"Bali to Perth with AirAsia Indonesia. It was my first time flying on AirAsia. Unfortunately I did not have a great experience. This is because throughout the entire flight two little kids kept grabbing the top of my seat like little monkeys. When they weren't dangling from my seat or my boyfriends seat they were kicking our seats, for 4+hours. The odd thing was that these kids did not seem to have a seat of their own, and were either sitting on their parents lap or torturing my boyfriend and I. I don't know that I can fault the airline for this, as we never voiced to the flight attendent what was going on. On a side note, I thought the airline provided plenty of decent looking food and beverage options.",1
2017,"Siem Reap to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. The flight was fine and the staff were nice. We were unaware that checked luggage was not included in the ticket price and as a a result we had to pay 72USD each on the spot to have our bags put on the plane. This has never happened on other flights I've flown. How can they justify charging that much for a bag to be put on the plane? That cost is almost as much as the flight ticket!  Be careful of this little money maker, if you don't check that little box when buying your ticket online you'll be paying through the teeth to bring your luggage.",1
2017,"Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu in October 2016. All flights were cancelled due to the supertyphoon, we got offered to get a refund of the flight. I filled in the form the same day, now like 3.5 months later my refund is still in progress. I got an email that I got my miles for that flight (I had to open one of those accounts at Air Asia just to check my refund status which is not nice as well), but the flights were cancelled. Bad customer service.",1
2017,"Booked and paid for a flight on AirAsia a month before travelling. The night before our flight to Phuket (less than 8 hours) we were informed our flight was cancelled. We were offered a full refund, or rebook on another flight. We had a commitment in Phuket so chose the refund and purchased tickets on another airline. Sent everything for the refund. Nothing happened. Talked to their live chat Oct 21 and was told my refund was in process. It is now February 4 2017 and after waiting in a live chat queue for 62 minutes I was told they are dealing with massive requests and are sorry for the delay - 4 months of delay! They have no clue as to when I might expect a refund. They don't handle that. I asked for an email to send a complaint to and was given the e-form. Already had written them but no response.",1
2017,"Yogyakarta to Denpasar with AirAsia. I used Web check in and boarding pass printing at home and no baggage (although for domestic always include 15 kg baggage). Direct to departures after security check. Good boarding process. Nice livery. I pre order 2 pax food (nasi lemak and chicken dijon) and get free 2 drink (hot coffee and still water). Total price only IDR 67 k (USD 5) for delicious food and drinks. I eat one portion in the flight and one in waiting next flight. I always love flying with Air Asia Indonesia because if the humble flights attendant. Although this is low cost carrier, they work professionally and friendly, like full service airlines. And this is always better than AK or D7. Delay in departure, on time in arrival. And I get high fare, because I see 25% lower price several days before flying. Overall okay and worth it.",0
2017,"Flew AirAsia from Denpasar to Perth. Had booked Red Carpet to eliminate queues through security immigration and passport control, and it did work very well, including access to a very good lounge. The whole thing was ruined by imposition of a fingertip search of cabin baggage - 30 minutes in the queue. AirAsia - we approve the need for security measures, but you must provide those who have paid for red carpet to receive the benefits they paid for.",1
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi in December 2016. I and my partner have always chosen to book with Air Asia as our preference for Asia. I booked and realised that I had the wrong date, it was the 22nd and not the 23rd. Okay, I should have seen this but I didn't. It may even have been the sites fault as I am so careful booking. I noticed this within seconds after the confirmation came in. I tried to call and after a wait of over 100 minutes, the call was answered. I was cut off by their agent. Infuriating and an absolute disgrace and contempt for their passenger. A wait of this length says it all about their attitude. Wait long enough so you hang up? The problem then goes away? I emailed 6 weeks ago and am still waiting for a reply. I had to book again and lose the first flight for both of us. Why do AirAsia not allow minor changes within a set time, say 12/24 hours? Not have a proper customer service centre that will call you back if wait times are over, say fifteen minutes or reply to your email? AirAsia has lost their shine for us.",1
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya with AirAsia. The flight departed and arrived on time. The ground staff for check in were not very efficient as there were only some counters that open and the ground staff were quite slow to handle the passengers. The cabin staff were kind and helpful. The seat was standard of LCC. The nasi padang that me and my family bought was delicious. Overall, my experience with AirAsia was quite nice.",0
2017,"A 7.50am flight from Kuala Lumpur to Makassar. Predeparture announcement was made by the Captain. Departed 15 mins late as heavy traffic at KLIA. The departure gate was right at the end, a real hassle to walk to. It was a smooth flight except about 45 mins before landing, where we encountered slight turbulence. Other than that, the cabin crew were attentive and took care of the passengers.",0
2017,"I took this flight from Makassar Sultan Hasanuddin Airportback to Kuala Lumpur. It was a late morning flight and it departed on time. The flight was nearly full but everything went smoothly, thanks mostly to the cabin crew expertly managing the passengers. I bought a prepaid gift online that was delivered during flight, as promised. The flight was more or less smooth along the way.",0
2017,"Singapore to Penang. Cheap flights but the seats are narrow and the pitch is not great for long distance flights. Only 29 inches pitch means you will struggle to sit comfortably if you are above average height. Front row (Row 1) seats and Exit Rows 12 and 14 have more leg room but no under seat storage in front of you and overhead lockers can be limited. If you book the front rows of seats (Rows 1 - 5, 12 & 14) at an extra cost you do get priority boarding so can manage to get luggage overhead. Service is good, on time departure if the flight arrives on time, you can book food at an extra cost but only a 1h 20m flight so not really needed.",0
2017,"Flew Sydney to Yangon via Kuala Lumpur. OK, AirAsia is a budget airline, no trouble. Unless you have no money on you and no water, you are in trouble. Everything here has a price ticket, which was absolutely ridiculous on a 13 hour flight: since when do we have to pay for a human right (water). The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all. We were boarding the aircraft while the previous passangers hadn't even left the plane! Secondly, because of the lack of legspace, it will most likely be a very uncomfortable flight.",1
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The check in was quite long and the ground staff not fast to handle. The flight initially was on time, but by the time we were onboard the aircraft, the pilots said that the air conditioner was not working and we need to wait for another 30 minutes. The flight in the end was delayed by around 1 hour. The cabin crews did not greet the passengers and involved in their own conversations. The food that I ordered was quite nice, which is nasi lemak. Overall, the flight was quite disappointing as the flight was delayed and the cabin crew not that friendly. It was worse than my previous AirAsia flights.",0
2019,"Sydney to Dubai via Manila, I tried to add extra bags to my ticket, so many times, unfortunately, it was kind of impossible to do that, clearly, it was meant to build that way so the passengers won't be able to do that online, thus, they will be charged more money while they checking in at the counter. That's not the issue only, they charged me two time for my 25 kg bag, once when I checked in from Sydney airport to Manila, and the one more time when I checked in from Manila to Dubai, however it's the exact same airline, same flight booking. They just simply reaping off the passengers' money, for nothing, underlining of the claim of company policy. It's my first experience with Cebu Pacific Airlines and for sure it would be the last, so kindly be advised and take the right choice not to book with this airline.",1
2019,"Sydney to Manila. As a budget airline it sits amongst similar airlines. I am yet to see a Cebu Pacific flight leave on time. Whatever the quoted departure/arrival times are, allow at least an hour more - often longer. Being a low cost airline, there is no entertainment apart from the staff who really only attend to Philippine travelers. They have played a quiz game on each flight I've been on - unfortunately the question is shouted form the front of the plane, so good luck in hearing it. The seats are generally comfortable enough for the roughly 9 hour flight. Take a snack with you, the food is not that appealing. Be aware: Sydney to Manila, you can take water with you. Manila to Sydney you can't. No Wifi - I hate to think what they would charge if the had it.",1
2019,"The worst all-round experience we have had. We flew form Manila to Dubai on the 20th November 2019. From the minute we arrived in Manila airport it went from bad to worse - firstly we were unable to check in on the self service kiosks so we proceeded to the counter where there was a relatively short queue with three check-in desks open it took over an hour to eventually get served only to be told we had not booked check-in luggage (luckily we had proof of purchase) as you can imagine there were a lot of disgruntled customers at the slowness of the process. Once we boarded the plane we realized there was no entertainment, no charger ports for a 10-hour flight some form of entertainment should be provided at least for this length of time. There was no complimentary meal on board if you are flying at 3 pm and do not arrive until 1 am you would expect to have some food provided. When the refreshment and snacks trolley came around there were no hot meals available only snacks. We wanted to pay with card and we were told the card machine was not working we can only accept cash - 2019 or 1920? We only had a small bit of cash on us so could only buy one bread roll each (2 passengers) to last 10 hours. On top of this, there was no communication from the cockpit to inform us of the length of the journey, where we were etc. Terrible service under no circumstances will we be flying with Cebu Pacific again. Anyone else flying Cebu long-distance, bring cash, some snacks or prepared to be starved.",1
2019,"Kalibo to Manila. Worst airline experience. Delays can last as long as 8-hours with no meals. If complaints are filed whether online or written, you will only get an electronic reply and won't hear from them ever after. Fare is cheap so don't expect a responsible service.",1
2019,"Manila to Singapore. My experience with Cebu Pacific was okay actually, the seats are fine and they have a charging port so i can charge my phone and use it as the inflight entertainment, The food though is not that good and it is quite expensive but over all if you are in a tight budget you can choose to fly with this airline and about the meal you can bring your own for you do not have to spend for food.",0
2019,"If prices do not differ much, go with AirAsia or other airlines. Cebu Pacific is ok if you're travelling lite on a budget. With baggage fees and meals and other add ons, it might end up costing you more or about the same price as competitors. Domestic flights are almost always delayed! Especially flights to/fro Manila. Very early morning or very late evening flights are fine and usually unaffected by delays (if you're fine flying on that time). There is no entertainment and seats do not recline for all international flights I've taken. Prepare for hours of discomfort and boredom if you didn't bring anything to read. Domestic flights, however, do have reclining seats. They have inflight games with prices which are usually CebuPac merchandise. This is the inflight entertainment, and lasts for about 5 minutes.",1
2019,Flew Cebu Pacific Manila to Legaspi City at 5:00PM. Chose this timing for the extended baggage limit due to aircraft being used. Was carrying about 55 kilos and I didn't face any problem at check-in as I purchased 40 kilos baggage allowance and Sports Equipment which is maximum 15 kilos ahead of my flight. Baggage handled well and was first to arrive at the destination. Ground service was great. Flight was full but slightly delayed due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was fine. Cebu Pacific is the best option for me when carrying more than 40 kilos of baggage.,0
2019,"All-in-all an unpleasant experience. Manila to Melbourne. I thought Id done everything to cover the two pieces of luggage I needed to check-in. I admit, it was my mistake (I think) in concluding that the two pieces I pre-paid for online had a weight allowance of 20kg each, when in fact it turned out it was for a total allowance of 20kg. This mistake was made from my experience on other airlines sites that usually either have a straight weight policy, or an individual baggage weight limit. Anyway, I got it wrong, and the penalty for being 6kg over was 6,000 pesos, thats close to 100, two thirds as much as the original fare. Id already paid an extra 3,000ps for a seat with extra legroom. The fare that looked very attractive at the outset had more than doubled. As others have stated, the seats are narrow and uncomfortable, and the food I pre-paid for was bland. There is no in-flight entertainment. If youre flying internally in the Philippines, Cebu Pacific might be a prudent choice, but in future, for international flights, I will certainly be happy to pay a little extra for a more pleasant experience.",1
2019,Legazpi to Manila. Checked-in online using their app to avoid any hassle at the airport and so I can go directly to the boarding area as I didn't have luggage to check in. Flight left on time and arrived a little bit early from schedule which was a plus. The weather was fine and the view from window was great. It was a good day to fly.,0
2019,I travelled with Cebu for an internal flight in the Philippines back in July 2019. I rebooked with them for a flight from Melbourne to Manila for Dec/Jan 2019/2020. I had to cancel my flight due to personal reasons. Instead of giving me a refund Cebu gave me a credit note that I had to use within 3 months. When I rang them and explained my need to cancel I got the usual terms and conditions excuse and they refused to refund me my fare. When Cebu had the opportunity to act with compassion and fairness they chose not to. This is unacceptable from Cebu.,1
2019,"We had an early flight out of Bangkok, we came early, no long lines before we came to passport control, there we waited around 20 minutes. Departure and arrival on time, I think Cebu Pacific are pretty clever to get their planes on time, even with the airport conditions they have to live with in Manila. We had a pre-ordered meal, that was a waste of money. The bad thing about Cebu Pacific is the very narrow seats. I am 1.83 and I sat with my knees in the seat in front of me for three hours. On the first leg to Bangkok, I had an aisle seat, I sat looking at the boarding passengers, when a very big guy, entered. He came down the aisle and of course he had the middle seat on my row! He took around 1.5 seats when he sat down, we were very lucky that the plane was not fully booked. They will get new planes in the coming years, where their seats are even more narrow, no thanks.",0
2019,"Legazpi to Manila. First time flying on Cebu Pacific on this route. I must say that it was beyond my expectations. Flight left on time. Crew were cheerful, it was value for money. Bought my ticket for around 700 Php which is way way better than taking riding 10-hour bus ride to MNL for double the price. Cebu Pacific is an excellent choice if you're able to chance upon their seat promotions 3 to 4 months before your flight.",0
2019,"Legazpi to Manila, August 2019 flight was on time. Perfect weather in LGP and a little bit of rain in MNL but didn't affect flight in any way. Bought my ticket less thank 1K Php so it was a steal. Ground & in flight service were good. I cannot find fault on this flight.",0
2019,"Manila to Siargao. Generally, from the booking to my actual flight to the improved after flight customer service experience, no issues at all. I am going to give a low rating because I feel that Cebu Pacific management will not care. This is because of how my nephews changed flight was delivered and relayed. Flight time change should be handled with care and consideration. He missed his flight therefore, ruined our vacation plans.",0
2019,"Caticlan to Manila. I have been flying with Cebu for my trip in the Philippines and every single time, the flight is either delayed or mad rushed with gate changes. They cant keep their story straight with the delayed flights, your plan left Manila 10 minutes ago it should arrive in 45 minutes 45 minutes later, your flight has still not left Manila, it will be leaving in approx 20 minutes. All lies. Waste of time for an airline. They simply just do not care. Poor customer service, unreasonable delays, high costs for extremely economy flights with below average planes. This airline is so bad and I wouldnt recommend it.",1
2019,"The personnel at Cebu Pacific Terminal 2 Departures were rude and unhelpful after overcharging me for a tax that applies to Philippine passport holders. They refused to issue a refund for the fee (around $50 USD) unless I traveled round trip 40 minutes to their terminal 1 ticketing office rather than opening the Terminal 2 ticketing booth. Luckily, I unexpectedly arrived at the airport over 2 hours early do to a lack of traffic, yet the service was still highly unprofessional. The staff seemed annoyed with me for asking for the fee to be refunded, and they were even more aggravated to help me reach the necessary desk.",1
2019,"Although this airline is famous and known for delays and cancellations, I thought I will give them a try anyhow. My flight leaves at 0850 from Caticlan to Manila and my niece leaves at 1000. I was told that my flight was delayed for 1 hr so I asked the agent at the counter if I could join my niece in her flight at 1000 since my flight was delayed anyhow. She said I have to pay $200 for the change and to me that was unsatisfactory since we will be arriving in Manila almost same time already because of the delay.",1
2019,"Cebu Pacific is so hit and miss. And when it misses, you wait for three additional hours. Do not use this airline, pay the little bit extra for Air Asia or Philippines Airlines Limited (PAL). I've been waiting in the airport since 2pm, and it is now 7pm, and I still have not boarded. The management of this company is hopeless. Aircrew are friendly, but management, my goodness!",1
2019,"Manila to Osaka. There was very poor assistance in terms of making sure their passengers are on board. We were in the airport 2 hours before the flight which is in line with their terms and conditions. The line in check in counter and immigration was too long and was very slow moving. We asked immigration officers for any assistance but they said a representative from the airline will come and assist us so we can just go back to our lines. Few minutes passed and Im more worried so we tried asking people to let us skip the line as our flight is already boarding, no one allowed us. Then the officer finally helped us. We rushed through the gates and when we arrived there are 2:50pm, they said gate is closed and we cant do anything about it. The next best thing they did after that is just assist us back to the counter which we all know is nothing! They let us sit and wait for an hour for nothing. No more further consideration in terms of our wasted money and time. Even when we talked to the supervisor, all that he said is hes sorry. Just that. It feels like they left their passengers on purpose for additional income for new tickets that well book. If they didnt want that, the best that they can do is to let 17 passengers board the plane few minutes before the flight which they didnt do. It was a very poor management on difficult situations. They let their passengers waste so much money and time and theyre a source of stress! This is not acceptable Cebu Pacific. All for the money. Thats why your customers cant be loyal to you. Because money is all that matters for this airline. They really need to do something about considerations they give to their customers. As much as possible, wont be traveling with this airline again. And Ill never recommend you to any of my friends who love to travel.",1
2019,"Our flight 5J 620 from Bohol to Manila was cancelled because of a short storm that occured the evening before. There was no need to cancel an 8am flight because of a thunderstorm that happened the evening before! Luckily we were reassigned to a 12pm flight later that day so we got home the same day, the flight was smooth but the overall experience was not nice at all! Also heard that there was a flight delayed for 20 hours! Try to avoid Cebu Pacific and get yourself a ticket with a better airline.",1
2019,Manila to Iloilo. You think you get a good deal. You better off paying a little more with trusted airline than them. Customer service is the worst I have ever experience. Never I will recommend this airline. Their website sure you dont do any changes because is you do even you dont confirm the changes it will go through and it will change you again. If you cancel with all the changes that they will deduct you get about 1-2 % of what you paid. Big big mistake on my part to try this airline.,1
2019,"Manila to Hanoi. Following a short storm and some disruption there was a delay to the flight of over 4 hours. Cebu Pacific staff failed to apologise, had very little information, appeared to be disorganized and unprofessional and did not inform passengers of their rights. Flights with other airlines appeared to be leaving. In short, shambolic.",1
2019,"I bought a ticket for my sister to go to Butuan from Manila. They took my money and then after about an half hour later.... they sent an email that stated the credit card was declined as it did not follow safety protocols. so I called them to verify that it was a good transaction and gave my consent to use the card .. they refused to use the card even after verifying all the information to be true. They also refused to refund my money that they took, as well as request that my sister pays for the ticket at the airport in cash, so I told them, not until you refund my money,  they still refused.

Allowing only one luggage check-in and we were charge a very expensive 2nd luggage amounting to $350 US, food and drinks are not free, pillows and blankets are not free, and seating are narrow and cramp.  My message to those checking out this airline, go check other airline and never fly with Cebu Pacific.",1
2019,The only positive I can find about this airline is the time given to you as a result of their constant delays and cancellations is the time to write a review about them. I was not aware of the recent issues this airline was having in the Philippines.Unfortunately this airline issues have been overlooked by the Countries Avaition Authority so better to avoid until there is a change in attitude and they show more concern towards the People who decide to visit this incredible country and its local people. In one of my situations a 1 hour flight between 2 airports resulted in a 12 hour flight across 3 airports. Dont spoil you holidays and look for alternative airlines.,1
2019,"Manila to Osaka. I am a solo female traveller on a budget not looking for lavish airlines or awesome plane meals, basic service is fine. Cebu cannot offer that and they screwed me over. 4 hour delay, desk was not saying why or when we would go. Delay caused me to miss my connecting flight booked on the same booking and Cebu will not provide any reimbursement. Had to repurchase two flights, would of been cheaper to fly with a legitimate airline. No one from Cebu was at the gate or terminal to help once arrived and before departure only 1 of 5 people sitting at the desk was actually helping out. Told one of the people at the desk about my concern for my connecting flight after 3 hours delay and he barely uttered Cebu is only responsible to get you to Osaka and walked off in the corner on his phone helping no other customers not even giving me a certificate of delay. On arrival there is absolutely no one from Cebu to help transferring customers and no other staff to talk to as its 11:30pm (5 mins after my flight left) and the airline phone number is closed till 9am. This cost me a sleepless night in an airport and over $500 dollars to fix. Cebu has offered me no help. Avoid at all cost.",1
2019,"To say this airline is bad is an understatement. In putting together a complex itinerary for my wife, it was overlooked to prepay for one extra bag (weighing 22kg) on her flight from Manila to Bohol. A simple oversight, right? Nope. We had to shell out $110 USD not only for the extra bag, but they also weighed the carry on and it was like 1kg over the ridiculous 7kg limit. How much did the charge me for this? more than 5x the prepay.  My wife was supposed to arrive a good 5 hours before the flight, but due to delays by Hong Kong airlines, she was there 3 hours and 50 minutes before the flight. 10 minutes after the 4-hour cutoff (where we could have paid <$20 for all of it). The staff (including the supervisor) refused to do anything or make any considerations. Robots. All of them. Customer support (online) was the exact same. Nobody cared and everyone just cited the online details. So we had to pay more than the cost of the entire ticket (which was $80 or so) just to bring on an extra 22kg suitcase AND we were charged extra for a carry-on which was not heavy or unusual. This airline is nickel and diming its customers and essentially extorting money from them at the ""last minute"". Well never fly this airline again and hope others make the same decision.",1
2019,The worst airline flying from Manila to Iloilo. The flight was delayed and going back from Iloilo to Manila was delayed 6 hours for no reason they do not inform you as of why they are delayed. They had other flights that came and went but were priority flights but not ours lots of upset people.,1
2019,"Manila to Iloilo. Probably the worst airline, located in the worst airport in the world, NAIA 3. From the check in process to flying delayed, it is hell on earth. Checkin was a mess. Employees were rude and inconsiderate. Plane is old and smells bad. Fly on another airline. Avoid this at all costs.",1
2019,"Jakarta to Manila. I have booked Cebu Pacific for the first time not knowing that eventually I have to book 2 separate booking for my flight without paying a luggage with Cebu Pacific. I was trying to pay the baggage online unfortunately the situation made me not to do it as I need to speak to Customer Representative in person to express that I prefer to pay 1 payment since it is the same airline and there is no sense to pay 2 times  for the same day flight. At the end the representative who checked me in at first country, could not help with the reason that it is different booking, and very likely He did not put any effort to speak with his superior. Very much disappointed booking with this airlines. Seems the customer satisfaction is number 10 (if it can be the last).",1
2019,"In the last 3 days, I have seen this airline cancel flights without warning and leave people stranded. My girlfriend and I tried to fly to Hanoi but her passport did not have six months left on it by 2 weeks. We were informed that if we got an emergency passport we could fly. It took 3 days due to holidays but we finally received it (passport). Excited to head to Vietnam we arrive at the airport to check in and the gate attendant tells us we now need a visa with a stamp. Something we were told we could apply for when we landed. Vietnam during this time was under a national holiday so nothing was being processed for at least another 3 days. We had already miss several tours and visits we were excited to see and a much needed spa day. Cebu Pacific knew there was nothing we could do with this new policy of theirs. They are getting 3 stars and not 0 because we have had one flight that was uneventful.",1
2019,Manila to Melbourne. Very poor customer service and extremely lengthy check in periods. I was asked to arrive 3hrs ahead of my flight which I did only to waste over an hour queuing to check in and drop my bags. The most frustrating fact was that there were over 9 Cebu Pacific check in employees standing idle with only 2 employees actually at the check in desk. It is such a shame and regretful waste of time for customers.,1
2019,"Every time I travel, I always take a nap during the flight. Unfortunately, the flight crews were very noisy chit-chatting about their personal lives. Me and my husband were seated at the back, literally the last seat, so we could really hear them talking about their credit cards, their colleagues personal life, the bag, the shoes etc. So, I looked at them just to give them a hint that they were being loud, but they ignored me and continued with their personal business. The flight was full at that time and one crew put her luggage under my seat. She just grabbed her luggage without saying excuse me which made my chair shake and woke me up. For the number of times I have travelled with Cebu Pacific, one thing I have noticed is that the cabin crews are rude and have no empathy. Their eyebrows are always on arch as if they own the world. Their service will depend on who they are talking to. We filipinos are known for being respectful and hospitable. I hope the company should pay attention to their staff attitude. We are all equal here, paying more or paying less, passenger is a passenger.",1
2019,"Ho Chi Minh City to Manila with Cebu Pacific. As the reviews say avoid at all cost. There's something about the Philippines and their welfare flight delays. Flight for was suppose to leave at 1:10am, April 28. Got pushed back to 2:45am. Don't know if we'll make our connecting flight to Princessa.",1
2019,"Bangkok to Manila. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I am a Filipina and I love my country. However, this is one of the things I become ashamed of. Cebu Pacific, you need to do a better job. Your lack of organization will put someone's career in the brink. For all the 4 flights I had with was all in delay. I could have missed my flight to go back to Germany and might cause me in deep trouble.",1
2019,Manila to Legazpi. Worst airline I have ever used. My flight was delayed for over 6 hours. All other flights from this airline were also delayed on this date. It seemed to be due to them not having enough aircraft for the amount of flights they scheduled. I have no idea how this could be a problem with an airline and must just be awful organisation. Avoid flying with them at all costs.,1
2019,"If you can, choose another airline! This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown in my 5 years living in Asia. It was terrible from the booking process and through the whole experience. When booking, the website didnt work and customer service was useless. 5 phone calls and 4 attempts online I finally got a flight. Then, the price was increased. When I finally got the air airport, the staff was clueless.  Once on the plane, we waited for over an hour without air conditioning or staff telling us why we are delayed.",1
2019,"Manila to Dumaguete. Absolutely the worst airline I have ever encountered in over 40 years of world travel. I have multiple bad experiences with this airline since I live in the Philippines. Here's the latest. Arrived at their check-in kiosk with 50 minutes till flight time. After waiting in line for 5 minutes, it wouldn't allow me to check in, said to see a gate agent. Then waited in line for agent for 10 minutes. She would not give us boarding passes, because we weren't there within 45 minutes of departure time. (Note that the flight departure was delayed over an hour). Our only option was to pay a 4000 peso rebooking fee to get on the next flight, at 4AM the following day.",1
2019,"Hong Kong to Manila. Honestly the worst airline in the world. After flying with them the past few years my very long patience has finally grown thin. Been waiting hours for our flight, even just to check in because of their unorganisation and unprofessionalism. You'll get a refund of your flight after a year, no one can give you any information, no one even communicates with you. They dont communicate to their own staff about flight problems!",1
2019,"Manila to Bacolod. Flew all the way from Houston,TX to get here and a few hrs before my flight find out its been cancelled. Missed my speaking engagement. My trip was completely ruined. Over $2000 of travel expenses that I was not compensated for because I wasnt able to make it to Bacolod in time. No reasons and no apologies.",1
2019,"Manila to Legazpi on Cebu Pacific was a flight nothing to write home about except that it was a good flight. Meaning it left & arrived on time. Ground crew at check in were cheerful and considerate. On this flight, we depart using Domestic Terminal or T4 that was packed with holiday-makers, good thing though our flight was not full so boarding was a breeze. With ATR-78 aircraft means the flight took a little longer, but enjoyable though. Baggage with breakables were handled well. Good job Cebu Pacific!",0
2019,"Hong Kong to Legazpi via Manila. HKG-LGP via MNL flights were on time, understandably enough since it is summer in the Philippines with less possibility of delays due to excellent weather. Return flight to HKG had a slight delay in MNL due to the usual traffic congestion which is not the airline's fault. Purchased 20kg baggage but was allowed with 1kg excess which was a good gesture. Clean aircraft. Beautiful crew.",0
2019,"Butuan City to Manila return trip. Both flights were a breeze, from easy online check in to boarding. I didn't buy extra baggage allowance so I went directly to the boarding area. It is almost summer in the Philippines so it was a beautiful day to fly complimented by Cebu Pacific's on-time flight, one cannot ask for more. Cabin was clean and well-maintained. Great crew from ground to sky. Highly recommended.",0
2019,"Iloilo to Manila. The flight was delayed. Yes most of the time the reason is traffic, which I would assume, is not the airline's fault. Wish they could coordinate to provide a decent wifi service for passengers in case flight gets delayed. It helps to keep our attention from the delay. We did online check in so no interaction with ground crew. Smooth booking process and online check in. Cabin crew were friendly, could smile a bit more at passengers.",0
2019,Manila to Legazpi. Flight left Manila on-time. This is the second time for me flying on Cebu Pacific's ATR-78 and the experience was great on this small aircraft resulting to fast & efficient service both on ground and on air due to aircraft's small carrying capacity. The flight time though is a bit longer. All in all it was a good flight in one of the aircraft I like.,0
2019,"Terrible experience at Cebu Pacific. No hotel accomodation for affected passengers on this diverted flight. We are all tired from waiting more than 8 hours now here at Brunei Airport. We got no choice but to rest at the gates itself. Sequence of this nightmare experience: 10:00pm departed Manila and supposed to arrive Singapore past 1am 1.45am Announcement of Emergency Descent 2.30am rerouted to Brunei airport 2.30am til 5am waited inside the aircraft! 6am asked to deplane! No supporting docs for those affected passengers who may not be able to go to work in Singapore due to the delay! 6.20am queued for the breakfast! Minimal ground staff assistance, we cant find them! Flight crews promised that ground staff will assist us upon deplaning but there were not in sight!!! We are clueless where to go. We found the gate by ourselves 9.30am current time but no further updates from anyone here",1

2019,"Flew Manila to Cebu with Cebu Pacific. One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. 5 hrs delay on departure, automatic rebooking on a flight later without information. Unable to provide full refund (only voucher) even under these circumstances. Staff lying at the ticket office.",1
2019,Very bad logistics and management. Very bad in providing information. We arrived at Manila domestic flight terminal 4 with 2 hours in advance only to board the flight 15 minutes before departure in a congested airport with not enough seats. The gate was called past what was supposed to be the boarding time. We then waited almost one hour on the airplane with no A/C (thus with very high temperatures) with no information whatsoever provided on why we were not departing and when this would happen. Overall bad experience and waste of time. Overpriced ticket and bad customer service from Cebu Pacific.,1
2019,"Jakarta to Manila. Just got cancelled flight twice in 24 hours, spend whole night and day waiting, just to get cancelled flight again (yes right, 48 hours delays). Refund policy takes 4-6 weeks, no explanation, no staff available - all is outsourced staff, not 1 Cebu Pacific staff available, outsourced staff cannot give any definite anawer. End up losing all meetings and lost all money on booked hotels because 48 hours delays. No compensation whatsoever. Would give 0/10 if I can.",1
2019,"Butuan City to Cebu City. Cebu Pacific is a no frills airline, a basic flying experience without food, etc - which I like if you're travelling on budget.

I can consider myself lucky though as one flight to Tagbilaran was cancelled due to ""technicial issues of assigned aircraft"". Bombarded with delays while same destination Philippine Airlines (PAL) flights in the other departure lounge were flying on schedule. Cebu Pacific is king of delays/cancellation.",1

2019,"First leg of the journey, Hong Kong-Manila, boarded 5J111 and we were delayed for an hour so our 4 hour layover in Manila was now a 3 hour. We landed in Manila and we were waiting to enter the gate but there was no marshall to guide the plane, we had to wait for 15 mins. Next was Manila-Cebu, we waited in the crowded terminal for our flight, we heard over the terminal speakers, that all Cebu Pacific flights were on hold, so I thought to myself, great, we are not leaving for a long time, we were delayed for probaly another hour and when we boarded, we were sitting in our respective seats and we taxied to the runway, there we were probably delayed for half an hour but that was fine, we took off and flew to Cebu. The worst part was that we were not seated together with the family. I would not recommend this airline if you hate delays.",1
2019,"Puerto Princesa to Shanghai via Manila. If I could give this airline a 0/10 I would.  Our flight in Puerto Princesa was supposed to leave by 4:30pm and but there were constant delays and we didnt end up leaving until 6:50. One of the passengers got sick on the flight and started throwing up. They made him pay for water. Our connecting flight was scheduled to leave at 8:20pm. We told the airline to please hold the plane for the 7 passengers who needed to go to Shanghai. They told us that they would do everything to make sure we get on the plane. That was a lie. When we arrived they didnt help us rush through immigration and we missed the closing of the doors by 5 minutes. They also told us the flight didnt leave yet and we can make it! That was a lie. We ran through the terminal as fast as we could. When we got to the gate there were two people at the gate The customer service pretended they didnt speak English until we started yelling. They didnt have a plan for us stranded passengers. They didnt have any reconnecting flights planned or hotel accommodations ready. They had no protocol for this situation and highly unprofessional. The made us wait in the airport for an extra 3 hours and tried to get strangers to room together in a hotel room. We didnt end up getting to the hotel until midnight, the same time we would have arrived in Shanghai if they just waited 5 minutes.",1
2019,Dumaguete to Manila. Who is crazy enough to fly them twice? Someone must because they are growing. But I will never ever fly them again! Got to airport 2.5 hours early. Sat past boarding time. About 15 minutes later announced plane was on runway. Over two hours later it arrived. I had another flight leaving Manila for Los Angeles. Talked to Cebu three times. They never offered to do diddly-squat! My phone didnt work there and had no internet! They said there was nothing they could do. Missed flight that left at 6:40pm. Spent the night wandering airports. Finally got a 3:40AM flight out. Will get to LAX tomorrow midday. I have been traveling  24 hours already and have still getting to LAX and then Atlanta!,1
2019,"Manila to Dubai. I have been traveling a lot lately and this is the worst airline I have ever used. I didn't have a pre-ordered meal, but I was planning to purchase in the flight some food. The stewardess told me that the Credit card system is down and I only have to pay in US $ or PHP. I didn't have both of these and it was a 9 hrs flight plus 1.5 hrs of delay on the ground. I told her to check if I can pay in UAE Dirhams since we are going to Dubai but she refused with a fake smile and not willing to help. I asked her to check again coz 9 hrs without drinking or eating would be too much but she was not willing much to help and just said No and left me. This stewardess was on flight 5J 014 from Manila to Dubai on the 6th Jan 19 at 4:10 PM. I can understand a cheap ticket flight comes with uncomfortable seats, no flight entertainment at all and not good food and beverages but people treatment is above all. This is definitely my last time to use Cebu Pacific. Another stewardess, agreed to bring me 2 cups of purified water after telling her that I will be hydrated for this 9 hrs flight and it is not my problem that the system is down.",1
2019,"Legazpi to Manila. I was surprised by how the generous legroom of this aircraft. Initially I thought seats are cramped as it is a small plane but I was wrong, though the flight took a little longer by 20 minutes which is fine by me. Flight was on time & crew, as usual, were amazing. Treated to a beautiful evening sky. Good job Cebu Pacific.",0
2018,"I travel sometimes dozens of times a year internationally, and this is hands down the worst airline I have ever encountered. Horrible service, rip off checked bag fees, fake smiles from the flight attendants, zero entertainment, and uncomfortable seats. Let me make it simple for you - their fares may look cheaper at first, but they will reach into your pockets and nickel and dime you at every possible opportunity! They charged me $60 for one checked bag (within the regular weight limit)! That is just one-way by the way, not including the round trip. Fly any other airline and you'll be better off. At least other airlines wont keep nickel and dime you, stealing your money like Cebu Pacific Does. You'll end up paying less with another airline just from how much you'll save on the checked bag fees alone.",1
2018,"Denpasar to Bali. I had a ticket already purchased for Dec 27 to return to manila. I purchased an additional ticket to return really because of a family emergency. I checked in for the flight 2 hours before. Was waiting at the proper gate 30 min before boarding. The only available seat was with my back to the gate. I was surrounded by people all waiting for the only scheduled flight at that gate. I thought maybe a slight delay. All of a sudden everyone got up and responded to a gate change. When I approached the gate they said the gate was closed. The flight hasn't left yet but they refused to let me on. No other flight that day and said I was considered a no show. I was escorted out past immigration and just left there. I called the online customer service number and asked if they could rebook me for the next morning. Was given the runaround and told that nothing could be done. Even though I showed up at the proper time and went to the proper gate I was tricked into believing I was waiting with fellow passengers. Absolutely no compassion for my case with this company. So I purchased 2 tickets with this company, ended up using neither and was forced to purchase a flight with another company. Never again.",1

2018,"Tokyo to Manila. Airline will trick you. High baggage fees, no checked baggage allowance, 7K max carryon, over priced low class airline, does not accept credit cards at the counter for baggage that you dont know about. So you have to go out and get Japanese Yen and come back to the back of the line. If you can avoid this airline at all costs. Its cheaper to pay a little more for your ticket with checked baggage included for free. Cost me 40 dollars for 50 kilo of luggage.",1
2018,Macau to Manila. This is the fifth time using this airline. Not once on time. Im sitting in Macau airport and over an hour late already. So sick of this airline and how being on time is not their priority. Ive missed one connecting flight already thanks to them. I will be using Philippines Airlines or other airlines if possible.,1
2018,"Manila to Legaspi, November 1. It was a 45-minutes smooth flight which left MNL on-time and arrived at LGP slightly ahead of schedule. Cebu pacific allows maximum of 40 kilos checked baggage on purchase per passenger. However, if you have more than that to check in you may purchase their 15 kilos ""sport equipment"" which is fair enough for its price. I have to commend the lady at the counter for helping me check in an item which was not allowed by the boarding gate security. All in all it was excellent flight and was able to take some pictures of the beautiful evening skies.",0
2018,I book for a 6am flight from Manila to Hong Kong and when I wanted to check in they replace it by one at 3pm on a Wednesday ! So i called the customer service : 15 minutes trying to convince me it was my mistake then i had to find back the original booking email. 30 minutes telling me there is no flight till the evening. I had to check a e-travel agency to prove them it was a lie. A bad and stressing experience.,1
2018,"Puerto Princesa to Ho chi Minh via Manila.  I booked 3 flights with Cebu Pacific and not each one of them was a proper service. The first flight has been delayed for 10 hours and they let me know with an email just 3 hours before departing. I was obviously expecting a refund - what they could give me was only 10 dollars of free food in the airport. Do you call it customer service? The second flight checkin process was a nightmare; regardless I booked a connection flight they said the system was down so they were not able to check me in the connection. Once again I have not been updated; so I needed to exit the transfer area and check in all over again in Manila. Of course this was not finished, they gave me the wrong gate number for the departure and once I get into the desk the flight was already departed. The next available flight was 24 hours later and  Manila Airport is not pleasant at all to stay. Once again, the staff was only able to laugh and play with each other even on my frustration. I experienced the worst customer service ever with Cebu and I do not recommend it to anyone. C",1
2018,"Manila to Cebu. Could customer service get any worse? I have flown on over 50 Cebu Pacific flights over the last 10 years and none have been on time! Today I am sat at Manila whilst my flight is yet again delayed. The scheduled departure time came and went, without any announcement from staff. I approached staff and was told boarding in 10 minutes, that was 2 hours ago! The next staff member said flight had arrived and expect 20-30 minute delay. Again that passed a long time ago. The third staff member said flight was due to arrive in 30 minutes so expect up to 2 hours delay!

2018,"Manila to Kota Kinabalu. Up to now I enjoyed to fly with Cebu Pacific because of the low price.The planes are new, however, most of the flights are delayed. The reason might be the overcrowded airport in Manila. Right now I am fighting with them for the refund of a cancelled flight. They said that they refunded the fare to my credit card but it never arrived there. E-mails or Twitter to the customer service are answered with standard phrases which are in no context to the problem. Right now they ignore all e-mails. So I think I have to go there with a lawyer to get my money back. I will never use their services again.",1
2018,"Dumaguete to Manila. The promo fare is already a big reason to be happy flying with Cebu Pacific as they give people opportunity to travel and visit beautiful destinations in the country. The flight was delayed for 45 minutes, not a big deal for me. Ground crew and cabin crew were friendly. As for the flight experience, there was nothing very special but I was not expecting much. Seat was comfortable. No reason for me to give them low rating. I am just simply satisfied. Keep it up.",0
2018,"Melbourne to Manila. A truly awful experience, poor catering options, dismissive staff who seem more interested sitting in the galley gossiping, filthy toilets that staff never checked and a delay of 4 hours plus.

2018,"Melbourne to Manila. This airline is not worth it. You have to buy everything, even a blanket. We been delayed for 7 hrs for stupid reasons, there is no onboard entertainment. The plane is a 1 year old A330-300 with a poor seat.",1

Out of 20 flights, 19 were on time and 1 was heavily late but luckily it did not disrupt our journey too much. They offered a voucher for free flight that we could use for an really expensive segment of our next trip. In the case of advance schedule change, Cebu gave us opportunity to adjust our flights, everything was smooth and professional. Most of our long-haul flights were landing ahead of time so we even took the risk to book a connecting flight DXB-MNL-IAO with only 1 hour for transfer between intl and domestic terminal in Manila and it worked perfectly.",0
2018,Manila to Legazpi return in August 2018. Both flights were OK. MNL-LGP delayed for about 1 hr was was fine for me and not airline's fault. Return flight was on time. Cebu Pacific is budget airline so everything is buy on-board. Service from both ground and on-air were commendable. All in all I can say the these two flights exceeded my expectations.,0
2018,"Manila to Cebu. Cebu Pacific has improved on some points I had issues with in the past. For one, there was no delay, flight actually arrived on the destination earlier than scheduled. And online processing of booking was easier.",0
2018,"Worst flight ever, a normal delay of 20 minutes without any announcement until passed the boarding time. The seats cannot recline. The flight arrived on time, but instead of letting the passengers get off the plane first, they will ""park"" the airplane to the overnight position first; before letting the passengers get off. That's extra 10-15 minutes of delay + slow luggage services from the Cebu airport. A short 35 minutes flight will become a 1 hour major production. Please improve your customer first services in your SOP.",1
2018,"Tokyo Narita to Manila to the usual system is that once youre in the check in they weigh the check in & hand carry luggages. If the handcarry is too heavy, there will be an opportunity to move stuff to the check in. The lady at the counter didnt do so, so we assumed that everything was ok. Once we got to immigration, the officer started checking the weight of our luggage. Ive never seen an immigration officer check the weight for airlines because each airline have different standards. This was already sketchy to us because it felt like a scam. This didnt give anyone an opportunity to rearrange the luggage to suit the required weight and you would have no other choice BUT to pay for the extra weight. 2nd JPN-MNL we still havent flown but Im just really disappointed with Cebu Pacific so Im writing this. Aside from the flight being delayed for an expected 4 hours and more, we had to pay 2900 yen for our check in luggage. Apparently we only paid check in luggage for one way (MNL-JPN) and we didnt do so the other way. But when I did the online check in, I clearly saw that we had one check in baggage. The lady said that she cant find it in the system and that we would have to take it up in the Philippines. We tried to explain that this was an online booking and if she cant find it in the system. Most likely they wont be able to find it in their system too. Assuming that they run the same system. So we paid and the lady said we should just try to get reimbursed. We left the counter and my mom realized that we didnt get a receipt. We went back to get it because they didnt accept any forms of card and only accepted cash. We almost couldnt pay for it since we didnt think wed have to pay again. Without the receipt, we have no proof that we paid for the check in luggage. No cards, just cash? Really? I understand that cash is a necessity at places that dont have the proper technology or whatever. But this is an airline that should accommodate every person, especially when they start adding up costs. The point is, this entire airline seems like they are running a scam and I am so disappointed. Needless to say, I will be warning all my family and friends about this airline. Id rather pay a little bit more for a better airline.",1
2018,"Bali to Dubai via Manila. Just want to give people a heads up if theyre flying internationally with Cebu Pacific! We had a 9.5 hour flight from Manila to Dubai. Please be aware that theres no comfort/service at all. Make sure you buy enough water at the airport/refill to keep yourself hydrated on this long flight. You have to pay to get water otherwise and youll pay twice the price for half the amount of water you can buy at the airport. If you are like me, and dont like the food on planes in general, have a decent meal at the airport and load up on snacks for during your flight. Prepare yourself for no inflight entertainment! No screens, no movies! Make sure your devices are charged, have a fully charged power bank and things to watch etc. Or you can bring a book/get book on pdf on your phone. Theres WiFi but you have to pay and I dont know if its any good. You dont get a pillow and a blanket so make sure to bring your own or something similar to make you feel a bit comfortable.",1
2018,"Cebu to Manila. We booked 5 flights with Cebu Pacific during the month of May in order to get around the Philippines. Not one of them was on time. One delay caused us to miss our connecting flight and they refused to help us in any way forcing us to simply pay for another ticket and the overnight hotel as well as the hotel we were supposed to be staying in at our planned destination. All this even though we paid for their ""insurance"" which is a total scam. The lack of efficiency is actually baffling. It is acceptable if a flight is delayed for mechanical or weather related reasons, however most of the times our delay was because they did not even have the plane at the airport at the scheduled time of departure. The difference between this airline and Phillipine Airlines is actually eye opening. Please if you have the choice and want a stress free holiday, do not book this airline.",1
2018,"Cebu to Surigao. This airline is shockingly bad. I have never had a flight with Cebu Pacific that has flown on time. I have even had the first flight of the day at 5:20am delayed by an hour (they switched us to another plane on the tarmac). We watched our luggage sit on the tarmac getting rained on even though they have plastic covers to stop this happening the ground crew simply do not care, they were nice and dry hiding under the plane instead of fixing whatever issue was causing delay. My luggage also now has yellow paint and scratches all over it and my padlocks are scratched as well presumably this is from contact with the tarmac at some stage. When leaving Cumiguin our flight was delayed 2 hours, check in staff took this extra time to pedantically weigh each item and charge for overweight baggage, selectively charging foreigners more than locals and allowing some but not others to have more than 1 bag as carry on and charging extra for checking these bags in. When boarding us onto the plane they walked us past the engine while it was running, the noise from the turbine engine was deafeningly loud and high pitched. The seats are uncomfortable and inflight service is non existent. There is nothing good about this airline, I will never fly with them unless there is no other option.",1
2018,"Osaka to Manila. Your typical budget airline. They don't really care about being nice to their passengers.  I was in the airport gate waiting area at Kansai Airport. There was a lot of vacant seats and I decided to seat up in front. I was already one seat apart from another person, who happened to be the First Officer. He asked me if I could move to another seat since the Captain was sitting there next to him and I should sit one seat apart away from him. I moved one seat next to the one I was sitting to, but I felt insulted.  Don't they have their own lounge?  Well, I think I got what I paid for, despite paying extra prepaid charges for the baggage and in-flight meals. I could have taken Philippine Airlines if this was the case. On the bright side, at least the flights were on time. It gets you from point A to B safely and my checked-in baggage was handled without any problems.",0
2018,"Manila to Davao. I don't recommend this airline at all. I was waiting since 2:00 am today and waiting right now for 4 hours already ans they still dont know when the Boarding time will be. They are distributing biscuits and a bottle water for breakfast but I hope they would realize that our time is more precious than those foods.  They have different promos to attract some customers, and in exchange are the Delays of the flights. I always pay the regular Price of this Airline, but still it does not make difference at all!",1
2018,"General Santos to Manila. Cebu Pacific has one of the youngest average fleet age. The staff, especially flight attendants, is eager to help the passengers. They have no IFE, but they  host these trivia games where three passengers can possibly win prizes. Their catering is good too, although no much variant, its a great value. I've flown with them 5 times now and all delays I've experienced is caused by air traffic congestion in Manila.",0
2018,"Bangkok to Manila. After a positive experience on my last Manila to Bangkok flight this was back to true 5J form. The flight was late by one hour, the explanation was the usual stupid ""late arrival of turnaround aircraft"", with no reason given for that late arrival. There was no information given at check-in about the delay, only the airport monitors started showing it. In flight it took the cabin crew 1 hour to finally offer food and drinks and then no Sandwiches or any other fresh food was available, only cup noodles. ""Sold out sir"". As usual. After 2 hours the toilets were soiled but never cleaned by the fa's. Upon arrival they added to everybody's delay by parking the plane at one of the bays most far away from immigration.",1
2018,"Manila to Cebu. Probably the worst flight company. We've booked 4 flights with Cebu, one was cancelled 2 weeks before the departure date (it was a connection flight) and the other 3 have been delayed (1h to 2h30). We have lost a connection flight. No one assumes responsibility they just told us that ""planes are delayed all the time"".",1
2018,"Dumaguete to Cebu. Worst airline in the world. No service, period. There is no pre-boarding cooling procedure apply. People are boarding in a hot cabin without air-conditioning. The seats are straight 90 degree without reclining support. They never clean their seats between flight since there always delay. Always late without any announcement, or the announcement are not up-to-date information just reading out of script. One of my friends even got canceled flight and bus to Cebu early morning via a van. Keep changing their flight schedule also every quarter. I wish there is another airline to join this route to compete.",1
2018,"Due to fly Cebu to Manila. Fly Cebu Pacific only if you have all the time in the world. As I speak, we have been delayed 3 hours and are expected to be delayed for more than 4 hours. If you have connections or value your time, fly Philippine Airlines instead. People have been asking Cebu Pacific to review their operations for many years now (they bump off groups at will also even if the flight was not cancelled, they've recently done it for an upcomimg international trip just last week) but they've not improved. Very much a budget airline operating in a near monopoly market. Avoid if your budget permits.",1
2018,"Flew Ho Chi Minh to Manila with Cebu Pacific. Typical budget carrier, no free seevice of snacks or even water. Friendly crew, clean cabin, no inflight entertainment, no pillows and blankets for a night flight. Seat comfort is zero, especially if you above 510, no leg room at all, my legs still pained 3 days after.",1
2018,"Manila to Bangkok. I'm critical of Cebu Pacific many times, yet today it was a perfect flight. On time, in a wide body aircraft with good lighting and the feel of space. Even the food carts were well stocked. The cabin crew kept their announcements and other botherings to a minimum, the entire flight from boarding to deplaning was smooth and calm and fluent. A perfect flight. I never thought that Cebu Pacific would ever warrant a 10/10 from me.",0
2018,Bangkok to Manila. This is the worst airline I've ever dealt with. To cancel or change a flight be prepared to recieve a refund of not even a tenth of the original flight and to be charged ridiculous amounts for add ons. The in air food also consists of nothing but unhealthy foods. There's zero confidence or protection with the airline of something happens and things need to change. Keep this in mind when booking.,1
2018,"Bangkok to Manila. A shambles of a check in at Bangkok, queuing for ages until after the last check in time! Told to run to the gate - this was not my fault but their very slow check in service. The plane was old but serviceable, with no IFE but some pay for snacks available - which I didn't buy. The plane landed at the new Manila terminal 1 which is very nice and we were out to the Yellow taxis in minutes. All in all not a bad service especially for the price.",0
2018,"Have a flight from Hong Kong to Puerto Princesa the 28th of April this year. When we booked the tickets we compared times and prices, and then decided to pay quite a lot more to fly home Sunday 6th of May. We did not have to wake up too early, we didnt have to spend a lot of time on the airport in Manila and we didnt have to arrive in Hong Kong too late. The flight time was perfect and worth the extra money. Then they changed our time and we ended up with 20 minutes between the connecting flights. We therefore had to change flights. In the email they stated that it could easily be done on their website. When I tried to do so it said there was no flights available and that I would have to contact them by phone. It was almost impossible to contact their customer service. I tried every number I could find and their Facebook page, but no answer. When we finally got through they could only offer us flight early in the morning where we would have to wait hours in Manila. I tried to tell them that we paid a lot more for the flight we originally had, and that the flight they were offering was cheaper on their website. Spent more than 30minutes on the phone with them asking for compensation. They told us the compensation was that we could rebook the flight free of charge. The flights they are offering us are obviously a lot less convenient, and I think its only fair that they compensate us for that. Making up for their own mistake is not a compensation, and Im really disappointed by the lack of help.",1
2018,"Manila to Coron. The worst local airline in the Philippines.  Our Flights have been changed two times and yet we couldn't even get empathy from the  people working in this Company! They are always going on overbooking and would just reason out that its beyond their control as they are doing flight realignments. How many times would you do that  flight realignment in one month if you are not going overbooked? We cannot always accept your lame excuse Cebu Pacific! You are getting 3stars here because you are giving low fares that just a plus factor on you, but if these people will experience the worst things that we had for you negative score is what they'll give you (if that could only be possibly given in a review!",1
2018,"We already experienced several inconvenient situations with this airlines such as delayed flights, boarding changes to name a few. But this Manila to Singapore flight we have is the worst. The day before our flight, our schedule was changed. We paid more for the schedule we took but you scheduled us to the cheaper priced schedule which has very inconvenient time for us thus we did not take it. Our important appointment was cancelled because of this. We called their contact center but we were answered after 1 hour of waiting on the line. We travelled quite a number countries already and experienced different budget airlines and I will say that this airlines is the worst.",1
2018,"Iloilo to Manila. Flight was delayed. Very rude employees collecting tickets to board the plane. They dont even know what a pwd (person with disability) id is. They asked if my mom has a senior id card for boarding ahead. She showed her pwd id card! This is in Iloilo airport. If i was given a choice, i would fly a different airline. Definitely not this one.",1
2018,"Officially the worst airline I've had the chance to fly. Ryanair, doesn't even come close and they are a pretty terrible airline. I am a very reasonable person who believes customers should be treated as if they were going to fly with the company again, in Cebu Pacific's case I don't think the staff have heard of the term ""customer service"". Here's my story - I flew from NRT (Tokyo) to SYD (Sydney) and I purchased this ticket with the thought of having a good tourist layover in Manila. Oh was I wrong. I had to add a bag to my checked bag luggage, well this airline expects 48 hours notice in Tokyo so naturally I assume okay, I will need to pay an extra baggage fee because it's outside of the time slot. Not great but I didn't read their regulations ahead of time. My mistake was thinking I would be covered on my second flight. The airline was less than accommodating because there was a 24 hour layover in Manila I had to pay baggage fees twice and ended up spending over $100 in fees to ship a backpack which weighed 10kgs back to Sydney. I spoke with the manager in Manila and he said there was nothing they could do. To add to the matter, the seats are bricks, and the food was terrible. All in all, I hate to complain but when a company is strictly after profits and does anything to get their employees to act this way there is a huge problem. Pay the extra $50-60 to fly any other airline!",1
2018,"Cebu to Caticlan. Worst flight company ever. I booked four different flights with them on January 2018 and all of them were delayed of at least one hour. Don't book with them, trust me, you would rather prefer spend your money with another company and not waste them. We had to book several accommodations because of them.",1
2018,"Flew Cebu Pacific from Manila to Bacolod. Staff not helpful at all! Flew from Manila to Bacolod and while I was checking in the staff didnt say anything that I need to check in the baggage. The staff said it was okay not to check the bags. I only had one suitcase and one backpack. They weighed 9.8kg altogether. So, after the check in I headed over to the security check area only to be stopped by the other staff telling me they needed to check the weight of my bag because I had 2 pieces of carry on baggage. When they weighed it, they said I needed to check in the suitcase and led me to the counter. I didnt have any idea that I needed to pay. For 2.8 kg excess they let me pay 800php just because I had 2 bags with me. I was annoyed because I wasnt informed ahead of time. This airline mostly has cheaper flights but you only get what you pay for. Staff not helpful at all of giving you other options. They are only after what they can benefit from.",1
2018,"Tagbilaran to Manila. Flying Cebu Pacific is like riding a bus! You pay what you get for! No service at all times. At the Check-In staff always well trained to seek for additional sales. Like when you are in your limits of baggage you can see the disappointment in their eyes that no money can be taken from you! Delays are not being announced. My travel partner was not able to make the flight. All reservations from my side were done through my credit card accounts and I booked everything through their website! As we had one booking, I needed to call 5J as I was not able to split the booking myself through their website. Calling them takes quite a while time, getting hold of them takes time. The agent I spoke to was friendly, providing me options within my case. As a rebooking for my travel companion was out of question listening to their options in our case, he decided to fly a different carrier! I was given the option that I could not refund the ticket although the ticket was refundable, instead I would be given a travel fund for 90 days! I was OK with that option cause I knew I would be flying again sooner. I asked the agent to split our booking and I was advised all further processes you can do through our website as you will be able now to change/rebook/cancel yourself online. I asked also the Travel Fund will be processed through my option to cancel and I was confirmed. Trusting the fact that I could manage all on my own, I did cancel the booking one day after in the knowing I will have a travel fund. What I was not told that the travel fund will now be only claimable under the surname of the booking carried in the booking! Which was now my travel companion and not mine. I paid all tickets and I did pay above 10.000PHP for this one way flight from Bohol to Manila. I felt sure and assured through my call that I can cancel it through the website and not needing to place a call again as waiting time and costs to save! So I cancelled all through the website! Doing this with the secure feeling of eveything I wanted to purchase a new ticket for myself. After being back in Europe I called 5J at least more than 30 minutes to find out that I will not be able to collect my travel fund on my name and to being told that I did agree to the conditions given as it clearly states online. I explained the call center agent the situation and she forwarded my case to an escallation team, and I was told I could call back within 24-48 hrs to find out of further results. I called back 27 hrs after, no updates spending 20 mins to find out, I callled 57 hrs after after spending 40 mins with waiting on hold in line due to busy agents noone available. I decided to contact 5J through Social Media - answer after 10 hrs NO UPDATE. After additional 2 hrs I was contacted by 5J via phone. My request was declined. Clearly 5J does not really care who pays the tickets of its passengers - their policies are clearly made to keep funds pending and to make it difficult for someone to claim their money! 5J does not care about their passengers, they just care about your money. 3300 PHP will be a gift to them as they stick to their policy not understanding the customers side.",1
2018,"Cebu to Manila. Constant delays on every flight I have had with them. Not only were we delayed at our airport of origin, we were delayed on the ground in our destination as well - we had to remain seated for more than 45 minutes because of the disorganization of this company. An absolute joke to say the least, spend your money elsewhere or you will regret your decision.",1
2017,"Booked to fly Cebu Pacific from Manila to Iloilo. First, they cancelled my confirmed booking just hours before my flight. I wasn't able to change it via the web due to their system issues. Secondly, they have rescheduled this trip a couple of times, around 4 times. Now I have no free schedules for December and have told them that but they keep insisting on their 30 day rule policy. When I scheduled and booked this flight, I needed to set everything almost a year prior to the trip, and they cancelled it just like that. Now, they insist on their rules not even thinking of any customer service or customer satisfaction.",1
2017,"Manila to Sydney. Was on a big tour of all the Philippines for 3 weeks and used Cebu Pacific for 3 flights. And every flight I took was delayed by at least 4 hours each time. Every time, the only thing the staff said was: We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause. Never using this airline again just because your sorry. Also on long flights; small seats (regular size as for short distance flights) no entertainment, no included food, no blankets nor pillows available.",1
2017,"I've been flying Jakarta-Manila-Jakarta route for many times since last year (2016) with Cebu Pacific as they are the only budget airline that flies directly on that route. In general, all my flights were a pleasant experience. Often times the Jakarta-Manila leg is on time. When it gets delayed, it's usually due to long boarding process (around 15-30 minutes) because passengers need to be moved by a shuttle bus from gate to the aircraft. Meanwhile, the Manila-Jakarta leg lately was always on time. It's worth noting though that both flight schedule are considered off-peak hours of the airports. Cabin crew service are so-so. Some were nice, welcoming, but also some were not. Though, I am usually not expecting too much from a low-cost airline. When it comes to food, so far, I've only tried their Beef Tapa and Chicken Tocino. Nothing special honestly, and in fact it is overpriced. The serving is too small for it's price tag. The only good thing is that they accept payments in multiple currencies: PHP, USD, and IDR. Lastly, their A320s look well maintained. In the inside the cabin looks clean, smells good, and is cold. Leg room is bad, so I always try to get the seat in emergency exit row where generous leg room is available.",0
2017,"I bought tickets from Caticlan to Shanghai via Manila. After some time, the airline changed the time of departure of both flights. The new departure time for me is not convenient and uncomfortable, so I wrote to the support service of Cebu Pacific with a request to fully refund the ticket for the reason of changing the schedule for the fault of the airline. In the return of money I was denied referring to the rules of the airline. However, if the airline changes the time of departure of its flights, the right to agree or disagree with the new departure time remains with the passenger. Thus, the airline's service is not customer-oriented at all.",1
2017,"Hong Kong to Cebu via Manila. I concur from experience with much that has been written in complaints as warnings to prospective passengers, but the worst scam from Cebu Pacific, and most likely it is Company Policy, is their one of an onward or return ticket requirement. My partner and I have both experienced that demand from their check-in staff, yet from no other airline during our frequent travels. In one instance my partner's destination visa was clearly annotated Return/onward ticket not required, and we subsequently found that it was not possible to obtain a refund for the return ticket purchase demanded by check-in as a condition of boarding. I was told just several weeks ago that return ticketing (to where? country of departure or home country?) was a requirement"" for my return to the Philippines, despite holding a 59 day visa as I have used regularly for 5 years, taking usually 4 flights every 2 months, almost exclusively with Cebu Pacific. On arrival at Manila I was granted entry, and no evidence of an outbound ticket was requested by the border staff. Both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bureau of Immigration suggest that this an ""airline requirement, which means that everyone, every time they fly international routes with Cebu Pacific, may be scammed into purchasing a new ticket with no refund option, reschedule fees exceeding the value of a new booking, and only a smug reply from the Customer representative suggesting you Put up and Shut Up! My experience suggests that any further correspondence or discussion will be ignored. So if the check-in delays dont steer you towards another airline; as untrained staff study the worlds immigration requirements, then check with their superior, before eventually accepting the next Guest from the queued backlog; maybe the very real likelihood of your ticket actually costing you twice as much as advertised, and reasonably expected, will find you seeking out an airline which cares just enough to complete your journey without further blackmail. Im not willing to take that risk again, despite their cabin crew, aircraft, and timeliness being quite acceptable, as their admin staff and I-hate-to-call-them managers have finished them for me! I have seen many other passengers subjected to this same arrogant inconvenience and expense, our experience appears very common, but Ive seen it only with Cebu Pacific check-in staff. Online booking hassles are a warning of things to come, both price changes and charge confirmation difficulties requiring calls to CP. When you finally are accepted at check-in there are pedantic baggage weight limits applied indiscriminately, apparent separation of baggage for customs scrutiny at the destination, last minute flight cancellations with no alternative offered, musical chairs boarding gates and unintelligible announcements - its an impressive list, and dont think youll forget the hassles over a delicious in-flight meal, either!",1
2017,"Bad service, bad planes, bad organization, bad Webpage and bad customer service. I've tried to buy a flight 3 times, and it doesn't work. I also have call them to solve the problems, and it was impossible. Finally I bought a flight with another company. I won't use Cebu Pacific any more.",1
2017,"Iloilo to General Santos. I booked this ticket last February and did not purchase any seat then. When I checked in online through the Cebu Pacific app, I was charged with a seat I supposedly purchased. I called and asked when I purchased it. It was the same time I checked in online. Now if I want to cancel it, I could. But I have to pay the same amount as spoilage fee! This is madness and unfair. I would like to say I will not fly Cebu Pacific again but this is the only airline operating this route. I feel robbed.",1
2017,"Davao to Cebu. Arrived about 2 hours early for my flight. But the flight was delayed for about 1 hour. When we were at the gate, ground staff were handing out free GetGo membership cards. GetGo is the loyalty program of Cebu Pacific. Boarding commenced, the seat was quiet clean and modern, but one of the tray table's arms were damaged, so it wouldn't stay put. Tried out a Kalamansi Muffin, which was a decent snack for the 1 hour flight. There was abit of turbulence but I could handle it. Cabin crew were very generous and friendly. Overall, great airline and would love to fly with them again!",0
2017,"I flew with Cebu Pacific from Manila to Boracay MPH, which was a much quicker option. I was hesitant to book as reviews were claiming poor service, cancelled flights and delays. I can't speak highly enough of the airline. Check in smooth, Aircraft was brand new and they tried to keep passengers entertained through the short hour or so flight.",0
2017,"Manila to Cebu, I waited at the gate for around 2 hours, since I arrived early. The problem started, at boarding time, which was suppose to be 740pm. The ground crew announces, instead of 119 boarding will be at 120! It turned out to be a chaotic ordeal everyone. Another gripe is with carry on luggage, rule is 1 carry-on luggage per person, 7kg carry-on plus a small personal item such as a handbag, or a small backpack. But they allowed people to board with a Carry-on plus another more than 7kg bag. And to my surprise, even the forward bins where occupied by people who had brought more luggage than it is permitted. I specifically got the 2nd row of seats, so I could get enough space for my 1 carry-on but the FA allowed people to use the bins, even though they had been seated in the middle cabin.  I had to stow my bags under the seat in front of me. It is a budget airline, but come on Cebu Pacific, improve your service.",1
2017,"Hong Kong to Cebu via Manila. On Cebu Pacific, things go ok until they don't, and when they don't go ok, they become disastrous very quickly! I and two business companions booked a flight to Macau for an important business meeting in China. Instead of trying to make connections on the same day of the meeting, we broke the trip up into two days. We chose one day to travel and rest up for the meeting on the next day. We had a 3:00 PM flight to Manila and a connecting flight to Macau at 7:30 PM that evening. We were at the airport in Cebu at 1:30PM. Our flight to Manila was delayed 3 hours and when they finally told us we would be leaving we asked for help because there was no way we would be able to make our connection. The ground staff helped us by checking us in for the Macau flight and giving us our boarding passes so we could proceed quickly to the departure gate once we arrived in Manila. Then they told us they would notify Manila that were delayed and coming! However, when we got to Manila, we missed the connection! Turned out that no one in Cebu informed the gate personnel at the Macau flight gate that we were coming. The ensuing ""remedy"" made us extremely late for our China meeting, cost of over $1000 in extra expenses we should never have had, and aged us all by at least 10 years. We expected Cebu Pacific to transfer us to another carrier so that we could get over to Macau, but it turns out that Cebu Pacific does not have any relationships of that sort with other airlines. The extent of the ground staff's attempt to find us a flight was limited to scanning airline websites looking for possible flights for us. In the end we had no choice but to stay with Cebu Pacific and let them get us to Hong Kong (not Macau) the next morning. Several days after arriving home I filed a complaint and the result was an email messages saying how sorry everyone was for all the delays and hassles, but that an investigation concluded that personnel followed acceptable procedures in handling our situation. I guess saying that you are ""going to call ahead"" and then not calling ahead are considered to ""acceptable procedures"" for Cebu Pacific. Never again. Most of the staff were very great during our crisis, except for one representative, whom when we first arrived in Manila and were trying to get to the Macau flight gate as quick as possible, we approached for information about our Macau flight. After calling on his radio, he informed us that the plane had already pulled away from the gate and that we would have to ""go outside and buy another ticket"", without even so much as telling us how sorry he was that the company had caused us to miss our flight. Cebu Pacific is good when it is good, but when things go awry, don't expect too much in the way of a remedy. I really hope they change.",1

Before this, they changed our flight times without notification. They don't offer any refunds or compensation.

2017,"Sydney to Taipei via Manila. My experience with Cebu Pacific was horrible, and I will never consider flying them again. Over the course of 4 flights we experienced, a flight cancellation, two delayed flights, a scammy feeling bag search, a freezing cold airplane, the worst meals I've been served in flight, being locked into a departure lounge in Manila and to top it off damaged luggage. The flight from Taiwan to Manila was cancelled, they sent a friendly email saying there was an issue and they'd call us, The resulting call was on the Tuesday where they informed us that our Friday flight was cancelled (no indication of that in the email) and we could rebook. Our rebooking options were:  a flight that left in 5 hours time (1am Wednesday morning), or a flight that left on the following Tuesday (eliminating half of our vacation). We had to make an emergency booking with a different airline at great expense due to their issue. The flight from Manila to Sydney was delayed by an hour. The return leg flight Manila to Taipei was delayed by almost 3 hours, (it took off after the projected arrival time) there was no compensation offered, breaking Philippine airline regulations. At Ninoy Aquino Airport Terminal 3 we went through security, emptying our drink bottles, the Airport water fountains were empty/broken. At the boarding gate there was a bag search by airline staff emptying water bottles a second time to ensure that during the delay at the gate (with no bathroom access) and on the flight you would only have access to water you could purchase from the airline at ludicrous prices. Boarding the flight in Manila the aircon was on so high it looked like and felt like it was snowing presumably to increase blanket sales. The meals on the flight were terrible - Chicken Tangalad was a measly portion of oily chicken and indeterminate vegetables with far too much rice, Chicken Tocino was basically the same thing but with egg instead of vegetables. Our flight from Manila to Taipei was severely delayed (over 3 hours) after an hour and a half at the first gate a flight attendant yelled ""follow me"" and led a crowd of passengers to a different gate, then the airline staff placed a row of chairs in front of a door and locked all the passengers in, you could see passengers walk towards the entrance heading to the bathroom then turn around realizing they were trapped. Finally after arriving in Taipei one of the 2 suitcases we had checked was damaged, To summarize, the service was terrible, the flights were delayed, the food was barely edible.",1
2017,Manila to Singapore. Flight was fine but booked 3 premium economy seats. At check in they couldn't honor our seats so I applied for a refund of the seat upgrade online. They agreed to refund my credit card but that was 30 days ago. They are holding my money and seem to be very slow about issuing my refund. Based on this horrible customer service I will not be a customer in the future.,1
2017,"Manila to Bacolod with Cebu Pacific. They notified me thru email that my return flight will be cancelled / delayed, and they booked me to the next flight (this is a good touch which I did not expect). I had to cancel and ask for refund which they did promptly. I only had to cancel because it was going to affect my next international flight. I was very pleased with initiative and pro-activeness which gave me time to change my plans.",0
2017,"Christmas vacation in Boracay with friends. Early AM departure from ICN, but as this is the only Cebu Pacific flight at that time, no need to arrive 2-3 hours ahead. 1.5 hours was sufficient as ICN has long lines lately in the morning. Slightly late departure, but plane clean and in good condition with friendly, fast crew. Booked exit row seat both directions, but empty rows meant I could move and lay down without any problems. Also used transfer service sold online and onboard and would absolutely recommend. Only two complaints: cabin crew really focuses on selling snacks and drinks too frequently, even on our red eye home departing at 1.50 am with again another pass before arrival at 6 am. Also, they didn't actually black out the cabin for this flight, just dimmed the lights down to faint brown. This made sleep difficult. Seat tip: stretching out in the last row is difficult for any taller person (180 cm for me). The curvature of the plane means a much narrower seat row. Also, the crew has to stay awake, and as such talks throughout the flight in the rear galley. Kalibo airport is tiny and is recommended to use the free lounge across the street. In the evening, five flights to Korea within two hours means a hectic departure area and wait to get into the airport. Wait in the lounge until they call your flight about an hour and a half before departure. Much more comfortable. If using transfer service, you will arrive at 10 pm for 1.50 am flight. Ask for help if you don't speak Korean as no English was used (I can speak Korean).",0
2017,"Manila to Jakarta with Cebu Pacific. Arrived at NAIA T3 I checked in to my flight. The ground crew personnel were not friendly. Boarding was quick but there's a hold before enter the jetbridge about 15 minutes. Another delay after all passengers entered the aircraft summed up to a total of 45 minutes of delay, which means we would arrive some 30 minutes behind scheduled arrival time. Later in the flight, I purchased a chicken meal and a blanket. The meal was okay, it's a typical meal that you'll get on convenience store but a little pricey and the taste a bit worse. The blanket is very thin in my opinion. Finally landed 50 minutes behind schedule. Overall the flight was good but I would consider whether to fly or not with Cebu again, since the ground experience was bad and the flight was not really that good.",0
2017,"BKK-MNL-BKK with Cebu Pacific. Check in in BKK was poorly organised with frequent queue jumping and a competition to see how many baggage trolleys could be jammed into a 10 square metre space, no control by anyone. Flight departed 30 minutes late but was mostly made up en route and arrived pretty much on time. Completely full plane with not the most comfortable A320 seats. Cabin crew did a good job in getting everything and everyone stowed on a really full aircraft. I'm not sure who was enforcing the carry on baggage restrictions but it wasn't happening, and contributed to the late departure of the aircraft. I don't bother with the fairly dull meal service on Cebu Pacific preferring to bring my own snack and I didn't bother with the Duty Free on either flight - and there's no IFR, so it's a pretty uncomfortable seat on a crowded, not very cheap 3hr flight. Check-in in MNL was an hour, despite arriving at T3 3.5hrs before departure. Flight was pretty much as before. Really not much to choose between Cebu Pac and PAL on this route - T3 is a much better terminal than T2 but PAL seem to have better slot times, less crowded planes and a better 30kg free baggage allowance. Cebu Pac are cheaper to change flights, but ticket prices are a lot higher than a few years ago despite lower fuel costs, so I guess the airlines are maximising their prices on a busy route.",0
2019,"Denpasar to Semarang. Probably one of the worst airline in the World. Delay has become a bad habit and they keep announcing delays without ever giving you the right information. Instead of being able to go to a restaurant, they make you wait announcing that you will fly in the next 20 minutes. 2 hours later you are still waiting. You are left with no food or drink that they should legally provide. Add prohibitive luggage fee (Im not talking about excess) and you could fly a decent airline for the same price. Avoid at all cost.",1
2019,"Jakarta to Jayapura with Lion Air. Flight left and arrived on time. Managed to score one of the rows of empty seats at the back, good for sleeping on this overnight flight. A decent selection of drinks and food were sold on borad, unusual for Lion!",0

2019,Denpasar to Surabaya. I have been reading a lot of negative reviews but I booked my flight 2 days prior to flying. It was the cheapest option as budget airlines should be. On the day of the flight the flight was 2 hours delayed. They gave every passenger a meal for the inconvenience and then kept apologizing which I think went above and beyond. Would recommend Lion Air to anyone.,0
2019,"I have at least 4 flights with Lion Air per month. Staff friendly, no complaints yet. Seats narrow, less legroom, for tall people a torture. No meals included, no baggage included. Additional baggage quite expensive, outrageous. The baggage fee can exceed the flight price. In all a cheap airline, uncomfortable, no service, baggage cheating by asking for high fees. No WiFi, no entertainment.",1
2019,"Denpasar to Jakarta. Lion Air is better now, even they still have no free baggage but it suits with the price. The ground staff was very helpful, they print out my boarding pass and gave me front seat. The cabin is clean and comfy, their flight attendant were very helpful. The lavatory is clean. Smooth take off and the flight is on time.",0
2019,"Lombok to Surabaya. By far the worst airline I've ever encountered. The person checking us in didn't even look at us, she was too busy flirting with someone else. Just unbelievably bad service. Previous times I've flown Lion air have been equally as bad. Terrible customer service and the flights are nearly almost always late. I will never be flying with them again.",1
2019,"Terrible experience! The airline delayed my morning flight from Denpasar to Jakarta by 4 hours and did not notify me. They do not even tell me about the delay at the check-in counter. I figure it out by looking at the time on the boarding pass! I reason with them that if I take this flight Ill miss my connection to Kuala Lumpur. They dont seem to care at all. All they kept saying was if youre not happy, well provide a refund. Nobody even moves a needle to help a customer out. I had to run from pillar to post to cancel my ticket, book another flight and obtain my refund. Horrible airline. They should be banned!",1
2019,Jakarta to Singapore. This is the most horrible experience ive encountered. They didnt have any sort of organisation or communication skills towards their customers. I was waiting in line at the checkin counter almost for 30 minutes and i have been asking which checkin counter is for my flight and it turns out that it was different. When i got there turns out I missed my flight because nobody was there to help or answer my question. Never use this airline ever again,1
2019,"Jakarta to Denpasar. After the flight was already 30 minutes delayed, I had to search for information myself, only to find out that there would be a delay of 45 minutes because of ""technical difficulties"". The airline's zero information policy towards its guests is shameful. Passengers are not ""customers"" at Lion Air, but simply ""numbers"". Not even the minimum requirements in the linguistic handling of passengers of other countries are met by the cabin crew. The crew speak a gaping English and can barely communicate with simple sentences. Even though the planes are outwardly standard, the care inside the planes is miserable. The cabin is dirty and more like a citybus instead of an airplane. Departure times are more of a guideline and changed at will, information will not be shared, the airline's constant delays are really ""remarkable"". On the returning our flight should have been 3 hours late without any advance information. It was not until I took a look at the boarding card that there was a different departure time than planned. Asked about the new departure time, the check-in staff member from Lion only commented: ""Yes a new shedule time ... we have technical problems with our aircraft"" ... then it would be better to rebook and return to Jakarta with another airline. As a passenger, I would like to be informed about changes to the timetable, etc. without being asked to do so and not have to do my own research first. There is also no service on board. Unless you pay. Is so far to agree with the pricing policy of the airline, but not that one can not even place his orders in English. For me it is by far the worst airline with which I have flown so far. Never again!",1
2019,"Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. We feel like the airline has been very unfair to us and so will not be looking to fly with them again. The main reason is that we were charged extortionate prices for luggage check in despite having no other option. We could not add luggage on their website, and even if we could, they would not only accept Indonesian cards for payment so we had to use an alternative booking site which gave us no option to add luggage in advance. Then when we turn up and we were charged outrageous prices, more than I've ever paid before. We complained to absolutely no sympathy. Very unhappy with the experience. Will not be looking to fly again with Lion Air.",1

2019,Bangkok to Krabi. My friend and I paid for return flights and hold luggage. We could not check in on-line for the return journey as their website was not working and when we got to the airport we were told we had not paid for hold luggage. Despite showing a receipt they made us pay THB 3900 and THB 3000 on our debit and credit cards or we could not fly. We both felt totally humiliated and it ruined a good holiday to end it that way. I will never fly with this airline again!,1
2019,"Singapore to Jakarta. The airline entered my name twice on the ticket and upon calling them they kept on asking me to ring another number, noting that not all were local numbers. At one stage I was on hold for 45min (international) before I spoke to a person and then they hung up on me! In the end they charged my $32 for removing the duplicate name from my ticket. The worst customer service I have ever experienced!",1
2019,"Bali to Labuan Bajo. Immense high cost of checked baggage. Ultimately, we paid more for our luggage than for the flights. How much is the amount, we have learned only at the airport. Intransparent baggage policy The scheme is arbitrary - even the call center is obviously not informed. It was not possible to know in advance what the costs are. Very bad customer service. To 5 E-Mail inquiries I received until today no answer. There are several service numbers that no one answers. After the 11th attempt, I finally managed to reach one of the call centers. Unfortunately nobody could help me there any more. The staff can not speak English, but that's not the problem. Even a friend from Indonesia could not get valid information from the airline. For me, that's systematic and deliberate rip-off. The fact that the flight was delayed by more than three hours and we spent a total of 8 hours at the airport is no longer significant. There are many other airlines that are not or only slightly more expensive. Save the ordeal with Thai Lion Air and Bay another flight. DE:  Immens hohe Kosten fr aufgegebenes Gepck. Letztendlich haben wir fr unser Gepck mehr als fr die Flge gezahlt. Wie hoch der Betrag ist, haben wir erst am Flughafen erfahren. Intransparente Gepckpolicy Die Regelung ist willkrlich - selbst das Call Center ist offensichtlich nicht informiert. Es war nicht mglich vorab in Erfahrung zu bringen, welche Kosten entstehen. Sehr schlechter Kundenservice. Auf 5 E-Mail Anfragen habe ich bis heute keine Antwort erhalten. Es gibt verschiedene Servicenummern, auf die niemand antwortet. Nach dem 11. Versuch habe ich es schlielich geschafft eines der Call Center zu erreichen. Leider konnte mir dort auch niemand weiter helfen. Das Personal kann zwar kein Englisch, aber das ist gar nicht das Problem. Auch ein Freund aus Indonesien konnte keine validen Informationen von der Airline bekommen. Fr mich ist das systematische und bewusste Abzocke. Das der Flug dann noch ber drei Stunden Versptung hatte und wir insgesamt 8 Stunden am Flughafen verbracht haben, fllt gar nicht mehr ins Gewicht... Es gibt viele andere Airlines, die nicht oder nur wenig teurer sind. Erspart euch die Tortur mit Thai Lion Air und Bucht gleich einen anderen Flug...",1

2019,"Malang to Jakarta. Absolutely appalling.We booked tickets that said they came with checked baggage, yet when we looked the day before flying it said no bags. Pre-paid bags can only be paid earlier than 6 hours prior to the flight. Impossible to purchase online within 48 hours of the flight. Clearly we were not able to go to the airport the day before our flight to pay a slightly cheaper price for our bags. The worst part is they charge by kg, so our heavy bags cost us about 800k rupiah (~$80) at the airport. The staff understood nothing and looked almost smug taking our cash (oh yeah, they only accept cash). Completely shady and unprofessional.",1

And on 27/01 in Banda Aceh airport when I do check in, I forced to pay 1.820.000; IDR on the spot which is half price of my travel fees, after 2 hours tried to get some help from customer service and they can't do anything just asked me to pay first the baggage and then the next day asked me to call customer service for comparing or claim.

2018,"Denpasar to Jakarta. Lion air is notorious for late flights with no information. You will not find cheaper tickets and if you are OK with waiting at the airport indefinitely then this airline could be for you! Typically flights accrue delays as the day goes on due to ""operational reasons"" which typically are late accumulated arrivals over the day. The staff is obnoxious about the delays and have heard all complaints from passengers over the years to the point that another one is but a grain of sand on a beach. Lion air, always delayed, always disappointing on everything except the price. The number of times I promised myself to pay the premium to fly anything but lion somehow got beaten again by the stated schedule.",1

However, Lion Air staff at Jayapura tried to blame missing the connection on me (despite their first flight being an hour late) and insist that I buy a new ticket to Jakarta! It took almost an hour of arguing to get them to rebook me for next morning's flight at no cost. Other than this issue, both flights were uneventful.",1

So we had to wait over 5 hours until we could take off so we  missed our connecting flight. I asked the staff at lion air to help us but they were totally unsympathetic and refusing responsibility and we had to buy replacement flights with Garuda air instead.

This last trip, unfortunately, the flight was delayed for over 5 hours. Now, I do not speak Bahasa so I was fortunate that my friend is Indonesian and was able to keep me posted, English is barely spoken at the airport and none of the announcements were made in English.

For the return flight I received a text message, the day before departure, informing me that departure would no longer be 19.30, but 21.15. On arrival at the airport, after questioning Lion Air staff, I was told the flight was delayed by another two hours. When I mentioned compensation I was told we'd get a snack after a two-hour delay, a meal after a three-hour delay, and after four hours compensation of 300,000 IDR per person (+/- 20 USD).

I was scheduled to board the plane at 5.55pm but the plane got delayed for who knows how long. I haven't heard on whether the plane has arrived or not and it's 7.20 pm now. The most baffling thing is that it's written on the general boarding screen that it's on schedule when it's definitely not.

2018,"Jakarta to Tarakan. Late Is Our Name is what Indonesians I've met call Lion Air. They claim a 70% on time performance score. I fly on them at least once or twice a month because I usually have no other option (like it or not, they have flights to more places than anyone else). How is it that easily 75% of the time I am in the 30% of flights that are late? They invariably claim operational reasons are behind the delays. What this often means is that they give the plane that was scheduled for your flight to another flight that was delayed. That way they can get away with giving passengers some bottled water and a bun for your 2-hour delay instead of forking over Rp.400000 to each passenger who would have been delayed for 4 hours on the other flight (as required by Indonesia's Passengers Bill of Rights law). Before serious penalties are incurred, they will then give someone else's airplane to your flight so that they won't have to pay you any money either. And these switches continue at that airport for hours until they get caught up or the day is finally over.",1
2018,"Waiting for yet another delayed flight. During our holiday we flew several times with Lion Air and almost every flight was delayed, rescheduled or altered.

2018,"Lombok to Jakarta. Missed connection flight in Jakarta because plane delay in Lombok. Staff offered no help to try and catch connection. Doesn't want to compensate fees for missed flight. Says I must go back to Lombok to receive compensation. The only reason why we booked with Lion Air was because we had an emergency situation on our hands. Our original itinerary was to fly Denpasar to Incheon via Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines. When trying to get to back to Bali from the Gili Isles, our boat was cancelled due to rough seas so we were dropped off on Lombok. With no viable way to catch our flights out of either Denpasar or Kuala Lumpur, decided to book with Lion Air to Jakarta to try and catch a flight to Seoul. After booking, we repeatedly asked the staff if there would be a possibility that this flight would be delayed and their response was no. So we booked a separate connecting flight from Jakarta to Seoul. When it was time to board in Lombok, an announcement says that our flight is delayed 1.5 hours. We ask staff Lion Air staff if there is anything they can do to help us when we land in Jakarta to make sure we get to our connection and they just give us this certificate of delay paper. Fastforward to landing in Jakarta with 20 minutes until our connection leaves, no one seems to want to help us catch it. So we miss our connection and get stuck in Jakarta for 24 hours. Next morning we come back to Lion Air customer service to argue for some sort of compensation and manager tells me that if I want receive compensation for anything I would have to go back to the Lombok lion air desk to get it - same company so I don't see why they can't just handle my case in Jakarta. I would not recommend.",1
2018,Singapore to Densepar via Jakarta. Do not use this airline if you are a traveller and travelling to Bali from any destination.

We told them that we were going to extend our visas by 30 days when we entered but they didn't listen or care. The check in was due to close and they sniggered at us across the room as we frantically tried to search for some cheap flights which we would never use. They cost us an extra 140 pounds.

Not asking for much but it would be nice to see my checked luggage that saw a total of 1.25 hours in total airtime between two flights and a three hour layover before the second flight to get my back pack from one airplane to the other one parked beside it, you would assume that it's not something you need to be able to split atoms for to get right. Furthermore, the logic of having to pay extra for overweight luggage and have it lost is astonishing. Nothing like paying to have your luggage lost by a company that does the same routine flights seven days a week dealing with everyone's luggage as well. It would be nice to see the employees actually care about these types of situations maybe by starting to make phone calls and send emails and giving you updates rather than play video games on their phones.",1

The seatbelt that I have was broken so it couldnt lock, which is very dangerous. The washroom is not well taken care of. The toilet seat was broken and the soap container was extremely dirty. The flight attendant are ok. The seats are ok.

It was narrow but not uncomfortable and for the short trip it was not a big to do. Service was fine, we left on time arrived on time and I received my luggage without problems. The announcements were done in English and Bahasa Indonesian and well, the English was a bit difficult to understand when it was not pre recorded. All in all the experience and product was fine.",0
2018,Makassar to Denpasar. Unreliable. Massively delayed flight caused us to miss our connecting flights. Each prior flight on our trip with Lion also suffered delays of some sort. Lack of clear information provided at the departure gates. Information provided verbally conflicted with electronic boards at the departure gates. Not recommended.,1
2018,"Jakarta to Denpasar. This would have to be the worst airline that I have ever flown with. Our first check in online at Jakarta, had the flight on time, but alas we arrived to the airport the flight was delayed 3 hours, due to what they said was technical fault. No service from the air hostesses on the flight, I was glad to get off. Then on our return trip from Denpasar back to Jakarta, another 4 hour delay and  more technical difficulties.",1
2018,"The flight from Jakarta to Berau was a mixed bag. The leg from Jakarta to Balikpapan was flown on a B737-900 on Lion Air, which was pretty much on time though the flight was not very comfortable with very limited leg space. However the flight from Balikpapan to Berau was delayed by almost 4 hours which was really irritating since the flight kept getting pushed by an hour at a time. They did give each passenger a compensation of 300,000 for the delay but which did not cover the fact that I had to shell out extra for a hotel room in Tanjung Batu since the connecting boat to Derawan was missed. The flight as such was ok but the next time would prefer to fly Sriwijaya or Garuda despite paying a slight premium.",1
2018,"The flight from Berau to Jakarta was in two parts. We flew from Berau to Balikpapan on a ATR 72-500 of Wings Air which was quite comfortable since I got a first row seat and was thankfully on time since there is nothing to do at Berau airport. The check in process was smooth and hassle free. The Balikpapan to Jakarta leg was delayed almost 2 hours, thankfully I had planned a long gap before international connection to Mumbai (to Singapore). The Lion Air leg of the flight was relatively less comfortable and the seats were not very well spaced out, so I would say it was ok but would definitely would not plan a flight with Lion Air if time is critical.",1
2018,"Pontianak to Jakarta on board Boeing 737-800 NG. The check in process is smooth and the ground staff was kind and helpful. The cabin crew was nice and polite. This point makes me amazed that The flight was really on time for departure and arrival to Jakarta. Overall, it is good journey with Lion Air and I recommended.",0
2018,"Singapore to Jakarta on board Boeing 737-900ER. The check in process is smooth and the staff is kind. The cabin crew was nice. However, The flight was delayed for around more than 45 minutes due to late arrival of aircraft from Jakarta. Overall, it is good journey with Lion Air despite the delay.",0
2018,"Lombok to Denpasar Bali. I wished I'd read the reviews of this sorry excuse for an airline before I bought tickets. The reviews here are bang on. For what is about a 25 minute flight from LOP to DPS, they managed to delay a March 9 mid-morning flight by 4 hours for ""operational"" reasons and for a ""runway inspection"" by local authorities. Have never heard that one before. The operational issues seem to start at the top of the organization given that these delays are more the norm than the exception. (Our flight from DPS to LOP was also delayed by an hour.) The cabin crew seem genuinely disinterested and issue only the standard sorry apology but no mention of any kind of compensation or even any food or beverage during the delay. We will never fly them again and will let everybody within earshot know why. This company can't possibly go out of business fast enough. As an aside, we found it amusing that they advertise their 'door to door' parcel service on the seat backs. Who in their right mind would engage this company to deliver packages when they treat people with such disdain?",1
2018,"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. I know from the start that this airline is the worst airline among all airline in Indonesia. Well known for their bad reputation and deserves it.  Cheap but not have good quality (seems like they always have issues).  Just let you know if u were on budget trip please use other airline, there are plenty whose cheap but not as bad as this airline.",1
2018,"Batam to Bali. Late as always - When are they going to manage this problem? We arrived at the gate before boarding time was due. We asked 30 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off if there was a delay. Ground crew told us that the flight was ON TIME. However in fact it was delayed by almost 2 hours. We were not advised of any delay until passengers started to ask the ground crew as to what the problem was. We were not offered any refreshments as outlined by the Ministry of Transport. When we asked about refreshments from the ground crew they said - we are preparing the food. However it never arrived. When we asked the crew on the flight - they said the food is not their responsibility. That this always happens that there is a delay but food is never provided because the ground crew are a different group to them. We said the responsibility was Lionair. They tried to explain that Lionair flights are often delayed and therefore it would be very expensive for the airline to provide compensation to all flights, because so many flights are delayed! They then said that they were only the airplane crew and they didn't know if they were late because they never come off the plane! Total lies. Then when they did agree that they we were in fact delayed, they started disagreeing as to how long the delay was. Making up stories about how a delay is calculated. Finally they came to us and said the delay was exactly 1 hour and 52 minutes and that it wasn't delayed by 2 hours. But still nothing about the fact that we should have received compensation in the form of snacks, food etc. as laid down by the Ministry of Transport.",1
2018,"Flew Jakarta to Bali. The delay remains the same. I got a 60 to 90 minute delay today. It is like delays are part of the behaviour and culture in this airline. In this era, where people are very busy and don't have one day only to fly from one place to another, Lion Air needs to learn to respect people's time. So, if you do not have the whole day spare time just to fly, Lion Air is the last choice you should make. I think they have to improve to be on time unless they will lose customers.",1
2018,"Banjarmasin to Jakarta. I am happy because they use Boeing 737 MAX which more spacious legroom, comfort seat and less noise. Service is okay for no frill airlines. They give snack and drink because one hour delay. Good service from ground service with 20 kg free baggage and good service from flight attendant.",0
2018,Jogjakarta to Banjarmasin. I arrived at the airport in around 9 o'clock in the morning and my flight should depart at 11.30  but it got delayed for an hour so we departed at around 12.30. Seat pocket was very dirty. Ac was turned off and it was very hot. Bad this time. At least the flight attendant smiled at me once.,1
2018,"Lombok to Jakarta. Worst flying experience I have experienced. First, there is no transparency about the departing time, 2 hours of delay (which turned out into 3 hour delay) because of operational reasons, the desk operator doesnt gave us the clear and complete information about the delay, and they were rude to the customers. A dirty cabin. We have to wait for a long time for a shuttle airport bus after a late-night flight (about 30 minutes) and then wait 45 minutes to get our baggage. This is definitely my last time flying using this airline.",1
2018,"Denpasar to Yogyakarta. Overall quite satisfied but seat comfort is the main issue. I can't deny that I went for the cheapest tickets. Online booking was easy. Online check-in opens 24 hours before the flight and I was able to already select seats for free which was nice. Check-in and baggage drop-off at Denpasar Bali airport was quick. We booked 15kg of baggage, one bag was slightly overweight and I didn't bother too much beforehand. The employee weighed the two bags together and it said 29.2kg so no problem at all. I printed online boarding passes but we got new ones at baggage drop-off. Flight boarded nicely on time, about 10 o'clock before the 10.25 departure time. Pushback was at about 10.30 and takeoff just shortly thereafter. According to schedule, flight-time would be only 55 minutes and landing would be at 10.20 (Java time is one hour before Bali), but we landed at about 10.40. Taxi took only a minute and 10.50 we were waiting inside on our luggage. That took about 15 minutes to appear on the belt, maybe a little long. The flight itself was boring. There is no service available. Flight attendants seemed professional though. The seat was the main letdown. A little filthy and legroom insufficient. Should have been the same 29 inch pitch as on AirAsia but felt tighter. Couldn't keep my legs straight with my 1.92m and had to bend them. Because of the short flight it was doable but I would try to avoid this seat on longer flights. I would fly Lion Air again on short flights. Our flight operated nicely on time but I hear that can also be an issue.",0
2017,Lombok to Jakarta. The worst airline I have ever have had the misfortune of using. Since moving to Indonesia at the beginning of the year I have used Lion Air 5 times. Each time I have been delayed at least 1 hour. Its a complete normal thing for them. Avoid at all costs and pay the extra money to fly Garuda.,1
2017,"Flew Jakarta to Padang. This is the second flight I have flown in the last three weeks. The delay remains the same. I got a 60 to 90 minute delay today, the same as the last one. It is like delays are part of the behaviour and culture in this airline. In this era, where people are very busy and don't have one day only to fly from one place to another, Lion Air needs to learn to respect people's time. So, if you do not have the whole day spare time just to fly, Lion Air is the last choice you should make. The delay in my flight, I admit is my mistake, since I am the one who chose this airline at the beginning.",1
2017,"Pekanbaru to Penang via Kuala Namu. Painfully long delay during transit in Kuala Namu, Medan. There were complaints about it in the past reviews, and the delay seems to have been very consistent if not worse. The airline seemingly waited until the seats were full to board. Loading/unloading of cargo baggage was seen to operate manually without conveyor, causing damages to the baggage. Those who travel with tight schedule and family are advised not to choose this airline. Besides safety, my hope for Lion Air is to be punctual in the future especially when catering domestic flight. Please make sure also that client's baggage was handled with greater care. Thank you.",1
2017,Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Flight delayed for more than 1.5 hours and this is not the first time. Even now I am sitting at Jakarta airport my flight to KLIA suppose to be at 2100 delayed. Lion Air management should take neccesary action to avoid this situation in future. The worst flight.,1
2017,"Denpasar to Ngurah rai via Bandung. The worst airline I've ever tried. Please anybody if you were having business trip or very tight schedule please please don't use this airline. It is not even professional one. Why? This is based on my experience. Delaying for more than 7 hours, no informing from the management, too many reason explained by the management, waiting for luggage like forever. Very terrible.",1
2017,"Jakarta to Bali. Despite the dire reviews, my wife and booked flights from Jakarta to Bali with this airline. Flight departure time was supposedly 5.55pm. At 5.25pm, the posted boarding time, nothing happened. Passengers shuffled their feet hopefully, then at 5.40 an announcement came. Due to operational reasons the flight would be delayed by 2 hours! So we went back through security and got something to eat. Then 1.5 hours later, we negotiated security again and arrived at the gate - and there was a further 1 hour delay. But the man behind the desk couldnt even guarantee that and so we left and caught a taxi back home, weekend ruined. Thanks you Lion Air, we shall not book a fight with you ever again. I knew this review will make no real difference to the shoddy way they treat their passengers, but if just one person decides not to book with them and instead goes with Garuda (like we should have done) then my job here is done.",1
2017,"JT683 Lion Air morning flight from Surabaya to Palangkarya. Departed on time. The flight was not full, so all passengers were in the plane 15 minutes before departure. Take-off was smooth and the flight landed in Palangkaraya exactly at 7.50 am but landing was rough.",0
2017,"It is expected that Lion Air JT 955 (Lombok to Bali) would be late departure as most Lion Air flights are after midday. The two hour delay ""for operational reasons"" was expected however with no notification of the delay until you reach the airport always makes things frustrating. The biscuits and water for the children helped pass the time. However, when boarding, we all felt claustrophobic and short of breath. There seemed to be no air conditioning and the temperature in the airplane had each of us sweating profusely with most travellers only getting relief from using safety cards to fan themselves. Towards the end of the short flight it did really seem that we were cooking in the aircraft. Relief was only felt when getting outside the back door to get some fresh cool air. While I understand Lion Air is usually late other than if you catch an early morning flight, the travel conditions on this particular flight was extremely uncomfortable and unnerving for the family.",1
2017,"Jakarta to Denpasar. I will not book Lion Air ever again. They just emailed us that our flight is moved to an earlier flight but we cannot make it because we live far from the airport. When we called after a gazillion times - they asked us to pay additional charges if we want to move our flight. That is totally wrong because they just informed us hours before our flight and they are the ones who moved our flight first not us. We ware unable to contact them even if we called, emailed, facebook messaged, instagram messaged, chat and all. Their service is very poor and they do'nt accomodate their passengers at all. We also asked for the advisory during the Mount Agung eruption but they did not advice and they only told us that there are no threats at all even if other airlines already allowed flight change. Never ever book in this airlines if you want a convenient flight. They are unreasonable, rude and only wants your money.",1
2017,"Singapore to Jakarta. Obviously this 5 years old aircraft has seen a better days. First step into this aircraft, the cabin smells. Sit at 34A, but someone sat there before I get there, approached the Crew member, he is happy to switch another back window row for me and also alert the passenger that sat at my seat. Crew service on this flight is good, smile and pleasant. But the aircraft should retired. The seat is dirty and hard. The front pocket is wrecked and the tray table sticker should be removed ages ago! The seat pitch is very tight, my leg was uncomfortable when touching the back of the front seat, I'm just 5ft8. No IFE or inflight magazine. No meal served, although they have cart service, just a choice of two, a bottle of over charged water and a red bean paste bun. Flight was delay for 15 min. No information about the delay, mid flight and before landing information form pilot. Flying blind mainly. Rough touch down, aircraft part at remote bay and pax transfer to terminal by over crowded bus. No proper sequence for the disembarked hence everyone rushing to get a better seat or stand on the shuttle bus. Overall, not pleased with the airline. I didn't want to use the aircraft lavatory, because before I even open the door, I can smell the strong fragrance of urine behind the close door and when I open it after, the floor and the toilet was wet n sticky.",1

The flight is scheduled for 6 a.m however until 9 a.m there is no reasonable explanation when the flight will be departed. The only reason is the flight is postponed due to the bad weather. However, at the same time, several airlines has departed with the same weather condition. My advice for this airline - avoid it, the ticket was cheap but it is not worth it.",1
2017,Jakarta to Denpasar. Due to take off 7 pm. Delay information at 6.30pm. No more info. Reason not clear. Got refreshment at 9.35pm. Read from TV monitor stated delayed 22.10. A very bad expererience. Bad communication service. Really disappointed.,1

No one told me if it got delayed I have to asked the information desk each time it got delayed, again and again and again. There is no compensation given as well nor any apology said from the airline. I don't recommend ever taking this aircraft.",1
2017,"Jambi to Jakarta. Lion Air is infamous for delays. I took this flight because this was the lowest price and the most suitable schedule. The flight was okay, surprisingly no delay, but the FA was not hospitable. no IFE or inflight meal for purchase, maybe because it was just a short flight.",1
2017,"Denpasar to Lombok. Worst airline to date. They're never punctual for their flights and always due to operational delay. Terrible service recovery. Why can other airlines do it and not this one? Honestly, they don't deserve my time for a long review. In fact, 1 star is too much of a compliment. They should really think about the management or rather go out of service.",1
2017,"Jakarta to Denpasar. During check in there was an extremely long line. The staff noticed us and brought us through the front of the line and quickly checked us in. The walking distance from check in to the gate was fairly easy as this was a domestic flight. At the gate we took a bus ride to the plane.  The flight was delayed by approximately 30 minutes however the landing at the destination was only delayed by 10 minutes. The flight was quick and smooth; however no food or beverages were served or offered as there were none. Although a small water bottle was offered for Rp 10,000 or approximately less then a dollar. There was no in flight entertainment system also. However food and beverages could be packed or bought from the airport and allowed in the flight. This flight was last minute booked but we still got a good price. The only issue were the lavatories. There were only 4, they were not cleaned properly. Lion Air was decent and is recommended for its low price.",0
2017,"My flight from Bandung to Surabaya was on time. I did check-in online and it was ok, unfortunately I could not choose my seat, I think it's because LCC airlines. Boarding process was fast and efficient. The cabin was a bit dirty. We arrived safely and on time.",0
2017,Singapore to Jakarta. Nothing good to say. Aircraft is outdated and dirty. Seat pitch is extremely tight. Cabin crew is not friendly. Delayed by 1.5 hours.  Overall it is extremely bad and have bad time management. Would not recommend Lion Air.,1
2017,"Jakarta to Denpasar, my first time flying an A330 with Lion Air. Leg room was huge compared to the 737. The ground staff is okay (at CGK and DPS), cabin crew is nice and friendly, but the baggage claim took longer than I was expecting. Other than that, it was the cheapest flight and it is worth it. No IFE, only magazine. They sell drinks but not sure if they sell food on this flight. Seat width is smaller than the one in 737. Plane was configured in a 3-3-3 layout and it was quite new, and also clean.",0
2017,"Lombok to Bali. This airline is always late! I have missed connections because of them. After flying with them throughout my whole trip to Indonesia (big mistake), my last flight was finally on time. Unfortunately, they damaged my surfboard on that flight and refused to pay. Actually, they said if I stay in the country for another month, they would repair it for me. Ridiculous! The staff was so confused and had no idea how to handle the situation. After 3 hours of negotiating, my friend got his board repaired. They still refused to repair mine.",1
2017,"Denpasar to Jakarta. Had unpleasant time with Lion Air, both their system or their reaction in handling problem. I have bought the ticket and did web check in/online check in, I bought 2 seats and check in together. And then when we arrived at airport and went to counter to check in luggage the Lion Air officer said very leisurely that one of our seat is not available anymore and the flight was full already. They said their system didn't received out web check in data so the seat now is not available anymore.  And furthermore we have successfully checked in and we didn't late came to airport. Then they give many unreasonable reasons and the officer even said this is not their fault. After long wait and many debate, last minute they let us in to the airplane. We are very disappointed with this unpleasant experience. And we feel really insecure to fly with Lion Air again in the future.",1
2017,"Singapore to Jakarta. Lion Air has a bad reputation of having delays over and over. And this delay problem happened to me on my flight from SIN to CGK. We were departing at 14.50 and boarding at 14.05.  Not until around 14.30 the plane arrived and passengers are just getting out of it. Meaning that the plane just arrived from another flight. At 14.50 we begun boarding and at 15.15 we were taxiing. After around 30 minutes in to the flight, they put seatbelt on is still on and apparently we were having some turbulence but it's normal. Then the flight attendants offer some food and drink (which is very nice, I ordered the fried rice with ebi katsu). For the cheap price, Lion Air offers a reasonably comfortable seat for me. This is probably because i'm only 165 cm and quite skinny. The plane is quite clean and new although the stickers on the tables was ripped. But the lavatory could use some improvements. When we arrived at CGK we used the jetbridge. This is rare as usually they used busses. Baggage claim is quite the wait and they also changed the conveyor belt number. For the price, Lion Air offer good flying experience.",0
2017,"Jakarta to Medan with Lion Air. The service is just there, nothing special to mention. The flight attendants are servicing well, but the lack of enthusiasm and sincerity is showing. The seats are not comfortable, as they jam so many people in so the seats feel very cramped. There is also a rush to get overhead baggage as some people carry baggage that should not be taken to cabin at the first place due to their size. There is no inflight entertainment, and some seats don't even have in-flight magazines. The flight is not good, the landing is very rough though the weather is fine. I fly the earliest flight possible, so I don't experience delays that frequent Lion AIr services in Indonesia.",1
2017,"It was a early morning flight out of KUL. I was in a group of 10 people going to Radin Inten II airport in Bandar Lampung via CGK. There was a 5-hour stopover in CGK before our next flight to TKG. Overall, the flights were pleasant, but in the inflight sales of food was too simple; no food items were available, passengers were only able to buy water and a piece of cake. During our stopover, we had to carry our luggage from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 of CGK ourselves; Lion Air should have provided us and others with transport while in transit.",0
2017,This is the second daily scheduled from Bandar Lampung to Jakarta. We took a few minutes behind schedule but arrived on time. The flight was generally smooth. Take-off and landing was okay. The cabin crew were attentive to passengers' needs. The bus service from the tarmac to the terminal was also efficient.,0
2017,"I was scheduled with Lion Air from Singapore to Jakarta scheduled at 9.20 pm there are long queue in Changi airport terminal 3 from 5.30 pm. We have waited for over 1.5 hours in a que alongside many passengers from other Lion air flight which supposed to fly earlier, then suddenly a representative from Lion Air announced that due to technical and operational reason, both flights is canceled and the passengers are given the option to fly through Johor Baru Airport or Full Refund, many passengers opt in to fly for Johor Baru. The registration for transport in Changi Airport was a huge mess only two counters are open to cater two canceled flight, unclear instruction, clearly confused and unresponsive staff from Lion Air, it took us until around 10.30 pm before we can depart to Johor Baru, they provide a SGD$ 10 Voucher for food, went through multiple immigration and finally reached Johor Baru around 12.30am with hundreds of passengers. They say they chartered a flight specifically for us, when we are there, apparentky they uses Malindo Air, we are then proceed to do the recheckin which took us another hour until at least 1.45 AM, the flight information is displayed that the boarding time is at 2 AM, but then again further delay until 3.45 AM when we finally boarded, but not without a borderline demonstration was held by the very irritated passengers.  Malindo Air ground staff did not provide any clear information about what's going on and not even a water for compensation especially for the kids and the senior age passengers, all of them pretend not to know by turning their back to the pasangers and called one security guard for help. No apology are made by the ground staff or security, they provide a very rude attitude to passengers, and finally after a lot of screaming we boarded the plane and depart at 4.20 AM to Jakarta. It was a very bad experience that makes me to warn every reader to avoid Lion Air at all cost whenever is possible.",1
2017,"I was flying back from Singapore to Jakarta and it was not my first time flying with lion air. Ground crew at Changi was pleasant but wasn't really smiling that much. Check in was easy and everything was going well. When I got to my seat, the seat pocket infront of me was a bit ripped off but I didnt really care about it. Cabin crew was friendly and nice. There wasn't any inflight entertainment other than some magazines and there wasn't any food menu either. However, they did sell a few main courses, snacks, and drinks. The food was okay. Leg room was spacious compared to competitors. At the end, it was quite a pleasant flight with Lion Air",0
2017,"I flew from Solo to Jakarta. As a low cost airline, ticket price is the cheapest, as cheap as an economy train ticket price. Although Lion Air is known as the King of Delay, my flight was on time. The aircraft was good and new. They sold snacks on the plane if you hungry. I recommend you to fly with Lion Air if you have low budget, but if you want a comfortable one, pay extra for Garuda or Batik.",0

Reached the check-in counter 1.5 hours prior to departure. Yet, we are allocated seats in four different rows.

2019,"Kolkata to Bengaluru by Indigo. Check-in for the flight was smoothly done via the kiosks as well as the baggage security screening. The staff at the counter had informed in advance that the flight was going to be delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming flight which was good however on the notification screens it was still displayed that the flight was on time and this was only updated when the boarding was around the corner. The flight was delayed by an hour. So that meant instead of reaching the destination at 2310 hours, the arrival was at 2350 hours which was kind of late. At the boarding gate, there was an irate passenger who was taking his frustration out on the staff but the staff handled the situation extremely well. The boarding process was hurried as the crew tried to compensate for the delay which was much appreciated. The rest of the flight was pretty uneventful. However during de-boarding, the crew were polite and wished goodbye to me but not to everyone probably due to the fact that the crew were not expecting the rest of the passengers to thank them. Baggage was also retrieved in a safe condition. As a paying customer, I am content with their services and even though things like delays can happen in a congested area like India, they get the job done.",0
2019,"Bengaluru to Kolkata. On this early morning flight, I had arrived at the airport much ahead of schedule and despite that, I still managed to check in and print the boarding pass selecting my seat which saves on the money if one were to check online. Baggage drop was easily done and the agent at the desk was with a pleasant demeanor. Boarding started ahead if schedule on this flight and was warmly greeted by the flight attendants. As it was during the Christmas time, the background music was related to the holidays which was a nice touch. Departure was on time and the rest of the flight passed off uneventfully. Arrival was on time and was able to collect my baggage as well. Only thing I observed was that the key chain of my bag was missing even though the contents of the bag appear to be intact. And I am not sure if the airline or any of the baggage handlers might be responsible for the loss of the keychain. But it could quite easily have resulted in the loss of any other items so I am not sure. This aspect has the only negative over what was by and large a flawless flight.",0
2019,"Indigo claims that they are an ""on-time departure and arrival"" airlines. This is a joke. I have flown Indigo from Nagpur to Pune for the fifth time this month and yet again this flight was delayed as it always does. This time the delay is more than 5 hours and I am writing this review while waiting for the delayed flight. This particular route's flight always gets delayed and by now Indigo should have taken note and tried to fix the root cause of the issue. How can the same route flight get delayed always? Every single time I have flown from Nagpur to Pune with Indigo, there have been delays. On top of that, there is no refund or alternatives offered for the inconvenience caused due to delays. I could have definitely preferred some other airlines if there were options available for night departures. Unfortunately only Indigo fits into my schedule and I have to choose it for business purpose. I hope Indigo takes note and corrects this issue.",1

He promised that I would get a response. This happened on my domestic flight on 6 Dec. I did as I was told - wrote three emails and I received exactly the same computer-generated reply from 2 different customer service officers. I had left my contactable number and I have neither heard from them via phone or email. Please do not be fooled by their advertisements - I would never travel on this airline again.",1
2019,Delhi to Bangalore. Its very convenient to travel from Delhi airport to any city as its the only airport having wide range of connectivity. The staff is very helpful. I like the way they are providing services to senior citizens with full respect.,0
2019,"Vishakapatanam to Bangalore. A huge thanks to IndiGo manager at Vishakapatanam airport. There was a 2 hour delay in the flight and my connecting flight from Hyderabad to Bangalore flight was a sure miss. When I contacted the manager, he was kind enough to attend to my problem and did resolve it and rescheduled my flight directly from vishakapatanam to Bangalore. My issue was resolved within half an hour. I'm really grateful for your kind assistance sir.",0
2019,"Varanasi to Amritsar via Delhi with IndiGo. Four domestic flights in India, ranging in length from one to three hours. The planes are clean and fly on time. The cabin crew are kept very busy, so don't have a lot of time to be friendly to passengers. In most cases boarding and disembarking is via a bus, but it's pretty well organised. (There was only one chaotic boarding experience, when the airline was trying to make up lost time due to a late arriving inbound flight.) The seats offer reasonable legroom. We prepaid the Prime package - with extra baggage, seat selection and a snack and drink - and found that this worked very well on all four flights. All in all, this is a nice way to fly within India.",0
2019,"India  Goa (GOI) to Udaipur (UDR) The colour indigo is fresh and happy  even saying the word out loud makes me smile. The airline IndiGo is no different. Keeping in mind that this is a low-cost carrier, it was virtually impossible to tack any negativity onto this airline. They embrace a fun outlook on just about everything, from their inflight magazine, titled 6E (pronounced sexy), to their luggage buggies on the tarmac, called Ground Force. Yes, the seats are narrow (no worse than any other budget airline) and they dont recline, which is a blessing when youre trying to watch a video on your tablet/phone  thats right, the seats do not have monitors built-in. You pay for food and beverages (its the norm now), but the prices are fair and some of the snacks are served in fun packaging that you might even want to take home. I know I did. I still have my Nut Case. Blue is my favorite colour, and now IndiGo is my favorite budget airline. Four Thumbs Up",0
2019,"Doha to Kathmandu via Delhi. The staff in Doha assisted me very well but when I arrived in Delhi, was when the terrible experience started. After we got off from the flight, passenger with an onward journey to KTM were asked to just wait at the arrival gate exit without any explanation of why we have to wait and for how long we have to wait. We were held for about 20 minutes without enough seat there. At KTM airport, check-in was fairly nonchalant, again no smiles. And then the ground staff did a hurried security check for restricted items at the aircraft stairs which has been done already after emigration or they could have been done before we board the bus. The staff is asking the passengers to open our bags.",1
2019,New Delhi to Dehradun with IndiGo. Very superior staff around in here. Happy with the service provided by the airline and the ground staff as well. It has always been a pleasant journey. Great experience.,0
2019,"Bangalore to Kolkata. Scheduled departure time was 19:20 PM. Till now it is delayed by 3 hours and still waiting. The same thing has happened from CCU to BLR flight. That time flight started on time at 05:25 AM from CCU but unfortunately, the flight landed at HYD instead of BLR due to low visibility. I would advise avoiding Indigo to all of you.",1
2019,"I booked Kolhapur to Hyderabad via Delhi connecting flight. But in a day 3 times, the flight time changed and delayed us more than an hour. I recommend that never plan to fly with IndiGo if you have scheduled work. Indigo announcing that they are the on-time departure company and is a joke. We have a lot of options for our journey. For the good name in hospitality kindly correct yourself. Because of your unplanned schedule, all passengers are suffering a lot.",1
2019,"Delhi to Varanasi. An early morning flight without any hassle, departure, and arrival was on time. The landing was a bit rough considering normal weather conditions. The only thing which bothered me was the cleanliness of the plane.",0
2019,"Hyderabad to Ahmedabad. Generally good in terms of punctuality & service, I had a horrible experience when I missed the flight. They are not accomodating in such matters & charge you for rescheduling the same. In my case I had just missed the flight by 5-10 min. They now charged more than my original flight to reschedule it where I have to wait for 6 hours.I missed my flight due to cab strike in Hyderabad but it was not their responsibility! While one can argue that they did everything by the book, customer satisfaction was not at all their priority",1
2019,"Delhi to Kolkata. The flight experience was good but my luggage  holding straps were damaged, unable to carry it. I think luggage handling was very irresponsible.",1
2019,"Delhi to Pune. My flight time was 0450 hrs, I reached the counter at 0410 but since you have to reach at 0405 they didn't let me board the plane, and I  missed my meeting. Never will book indigo again.",1
2019,"Delhi to Patna with IndiGo. Positive First: Good Airline, worth the money for budget travelers and students. Good staff and management, runs on time. Negative Points: Seating quality is poor, no inflight entertainment service available.",0
2019,"Udaipur to Cochin via Delhi. Well this was a positive experience. I knew what to expect so was prepared taking my own water and snacks. The plane arrived on time and as soon as passengers were off, we boarded. Very efficient. We left on time heading first to Delhi. We had a long 6 hour wait but had to change terminals which you do by bus. The bus takes about 30 mins. We prepaid three hours in the lounge (good idea). Again the flight departed on time. Food and drink was available on board at s reasonable price although we took our own. The seats are just pads over a formed plastic seat but for short flights not a problem. The price was great, arrived and left on time both times. Would be happy to fly with them again.",0
2019,Delhi to Goa. Fantastic experience. We were given free upgrade to exit row seats with lots of legroom. Thank you to Priya who did a great job with excellent service. This was our 3rd time with Indigo and its been a great experience each time.,0
2019,"Jammu to Delhi. When LCC in Indian domestic route is concerned Indigo is my first choice and they are improving day by day. Last travelled August last week. Was traveling with only hand baggage so used check in kiosk for boarding pass, boarding started before time and so as departure  seats are okay, food and non alcoholic beverages are available on payment, courteous and helpful crew,. Arrived on time, a good experience.",0
2019,"Tirupati to Pune via Bangalore. Traveled with few airline during visit to India this time. Found seating arrangement of IndiGo much more comfortable than others. The best part was, ground staff Nagraj at TIR airport was serving customer extraordinarily. I needed flexible info. for my return flight to Pune, and within short time he provided the same. Simply marvelous. Thanks IndoGo for serving your customer in this fashion.",0

2019,"Mumbai to Patna via Lucknow with IndiGo. Excellent experience thru-out from check-in to de-boarding. Check-in at Mumbai was courteous, fast and efficient, and the best part was no nickling-diming for 2-3 kg extra weight. In-flight crew was even better with all the ladies acting pleasant and welcoming. It's the crew that makes the airline, truly.",0
2019,I was travelling with my wife and 6 months old baby. While checking in from Cochin the ground staff at the counter gave us seats [19F and 19C] saying its seated together. Later I realised she did a mistake and it should be 19D. I was walking through the airport randomly looking for your staff to sort this issue out and found one of your agents. She looked through it and tried from her end and told me it wont be possible at this time as other seats are already occupied and you can do it on board and there is a lady seated at 19D. I told her my daughter is already tired from the Male flight and its important for us to sit together. She understood our situation and told she will try her best. At time of boarding I explained the same situation to boarding agent. She replied the same saying you should try it on board as nothing she could do it now. There comes the pleasant surprise! This staff member came all the way to our gate which she doesnt have to bother doing at all. She literally looked for the passenger seated at 19D and talked to her and agreed to swap seats with mine. I was very much overwhelmed with her genuine concern towards our issue and how she went well and above to sort this out for us. Please pass my sincere gratitude to her. She deserves it. However on other hand on board it was totally opposite experience. I know its a short flight to CNN but crew didnt make any effort to do the service for this flight. They didnt took the food cart out to the aisle or neither brought the round of water at least. They were just busy in the galley throughout until landing. I never even saw them securing the cabin! When the captain made announcements they went to the seat ready for landing. In contrast on the CNN to COK flight I received full service like any other flight and I was amazed the way they ignored the cabin just like that inspite of full flight.,1
2019,"I travelled Cochin to Chennai. One of the best parts of flying in Indigo is the timing, always on time. The cabin crews was well trained and pleasant,  I truly like the ambience and the behaviour of the cabin crew. All i want to say is try Indigo airline and you will feel the difference.",0
2019,Delhi to Nagpur. All my experiences with this airline are very poor. Specially the courtesy of the staff is very poor. The legspace and the seats are very uncomfortable. One must choose to fly with this airline only when there is no alternative. The staff right at the check-in to even the customer care is so rude. The boast to fly on time but at what cost. They maintain the schedule at the cost of inconvenience of the guest. Onboard food is horrible. Overall one should prefer any other available alternative.,0
2019,Chennai via Kuwait. This is my first fly on indigo. Because of the crew. They give a five star service and the flight is on time takeoff and landing. I really appreciate to those staff. I hope to fly again in indigo.,0
2019,"Dubai to Cochin was a nice flight at the end of December 2018. Water is provided, but food only provided by payment only. Half an hour delay is normal from Dubai based flights. 45 minutes delayed, but arrived ontime. Got the baggage delivered on time upon arrival at COK. Onboard nothing except the small bottle of water. No entertainment screen. If you have movies on your mobile or tab like devices fly with them.",1
2019,"Delhi to Hyderabad. Highly appreciate the customer-centric service of IndiGo. I was coming from the USA to Hyderabad with an intermediate connection through IndiGo in Delhi. My check-in luggage was close to 45 kgs (with an excess of 30 kgs). However, under normal baggage policy terms, the excess amount was coming out to be 30x400 = 12000 INR. Because of two ground staff intervention, they helped me realize the facility of International customers and their luggage benefits. Went the extra mile to confirm the price with the technical service team and made me pay 7800 INR, instead of 12K. I really appreciate these two staff members professionalism in taking 40 min extra time to help me and support me through out the check in process. Thanks to these two staff members for your Customer Centric service in the middle of the night for a jet-lagged customer like me. Well done IndiGo for maintaining such enthusiastic employees.",0
2019,Vadadora to Mumbai. I had travel within India and saw that this was a viable airline. The planes are fairly nice and the service is good.  I have 2 separate reservations connecting in Mumbai. They would not put the luggage to my final destination or combine the tickets. Very frustrating...the discount way!,0
2019,"Delhi to Bagdogra. Very good inflight service provided by cabin crews, specially Nayan & Somiya. Food served to us was very tasty. Thanks and hope to enjoy your service again.",0
2019,"Mumbai to Bangalore. Low-cost airline with high-class service. The flight was on time, the ground staff were there to assist all passengers to get on board. Aircraft was mighty clean and the service was excellent. Bought a sandwich on both legs, which was amazing. When I compare the services of Indigo to the low-cost airlines in the US, all I can say there is no comparison. Indigo has a far superior product.",0
2019,"Bangalore to Chennai. This is the only airline I have flown that has such a hard restriction on carry-on weight: 7kg per person, period. This makes it impossible to carry a laptop bag and a carry-on with clothes. Even other low-cost airlines (eg. Jetstar) will allow you to pay for extra carry-on weight. As a business traveler flying 5 times in 8 days, this is a colossal waste of time waiting for checked bags at every stop. Not to mention the risk of an eventual misplaced bag.",1
2019,"Bangalore to Mangalore. Extremely poor service. Three tickets were booked and were given scattered seats. One of the passenger is a 5yr old. I just have one question, are you guys that stupid to not understand that a child would need the company of one of the parents? When I asked the staff for assistance all they had to say is to try to convince any of the passengers to move. Great help. To me, this is a disastrous experience.",1
2019,"Mumbai to Kolkata with IndiGo. Our flight was first delayed by 30 minutes then once we got to get our boarding passes they tell us our flight has been split in 2 so now we have to fly to Hyderabad then to Kolkata. Alongside that once we boarded the plane they said theres even more time to wait to clean up the deck, what in the world does that even mean, please tell me.",1
2019,"I understand it is a budget airline. I got the biggest shock of IndiGo's on-time performance. Once the incoming flight landed, they immediately started boarding and even after scanning our boarding pass they made us wait three times at three places, as there were still passengers deplaning from the incoming flight! I was flying with two elderly passengers with knee problems as this took a big toll on their leg having to wait for a long while. This also means they did not even clean the plane at all as soon as the incoming flight landed. How unhygienic! This is how they fly on-time. High On-time performance at the cost of hygiene!",1
2019,"Nagpur to Pune. The flight got delayed by almost 2 hours. The flight time was 00.05 hrs to 01.10 hrs, the shops were almost closed. The staff didnt provide tea or coffee as it was so late hours and none of the shops were open. Very disappointed with this service. We were informed about the delay just 20 mins before boarding time.",1
2019,Kolkata to Bangalore. Excellent service! Very touched with prompt service. Well done. Hope you keep your service up. Very touched that my tea was replaced with a fresh cup. The cabin crew was very polite.,0
2019,"Delhi to Kochi. On May 31, I reached the airport at around 6:00 AM and checked in at the emergency counter. I had a friend also traveling with me whose luggage was less than 15 Kg. I asked the indigo staff if my excess luggage can be adjusted with him. Staff  told me to pay the extra amount. I immediately agreed to pay. Hence as per the baggage policy, I paid 400*10Kg -4000Rs. On arriving at Kochi airport after a 40-minute wait, I discovered that one of the luggage was lost and reported to the baggage claim representative. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, she cross-checked with the boarding pass and confirmed me that the bag of 10Kg is missing. I spoke to the indigo staff and have no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage. One of the senior officials of Indigo called me on June 9th and confirmed that the bag weight was 10Kg and a refund of 3500INR will be given. I expressed a complete dissatisfaction as I paid 4000Rs extra for the same bag. The staff promised me that he will check with the finance department and revert back. But I haven't received any call yet. I find it unprofessional how such a large airline like Indigo can lose luggage.  To add insult to injury, I am faced with obtaining compensation for those items that are far less than their worth.",1
2019,"This airline has never disappoints me even though you dont get free meals, however I had booked my meals and they were very tasty and also their check in and hand baggage allowance is similar to that of many full service carriers and their on time performance puts other airlines to shame. The one hour flight from jaipur to Lucknow was on time and landed 5 minutes before arrival time. The ground staff was courteous and so was the cabin crew with genuine smile.",0
2019,"Ahmadabad to Mumbai. Total chaos, paid for extra luggage but receipt printer not working. A girl trying to fix but she has no clue how to fix? Asked to wait 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes but printer did not work, she filled up manual receipt and handed over to me, by this time already running late for flight, she allowed 2 small carry on but  supervisor did not allow at security checkpoint, now I have to start from square one, scan bag, bag drop off. A girl at bag drop off wants to charge for extra luggage but printer is not working and I am running out of time, supervisor came, things did not work, bag was checked in without any charge. I rushed through security, heard my name announced on PA, before last call rushed to boarding gate.",1
2019,"I was in India on a holiday and I decided to fly with IndiGo from Mangalore to Mumbai. The ground staff and the cabin crew were really helpful and welcoming. The in-flight meal options were limited but it was a standard domestic flight like menu so no complaints there. The flight was tidy and the journey was very comfortable. The best part about the flight was the punctuality. Overall it was an excellent experience and if I would need to travel by a domestic flight in India the next time, I know which airline I am going to look out for.",0
2019,"I accidentally interchanged the boarding date and ended up messing up my flight tickets FOR jUNE 2019. My tickets were under the category which cannot be rescheduled, so I panicked as the amount I paid was over 20000 rupees and with my previous experience with domestic airlines, I was sure I am losing all the money and would be asked to re-book the entire journey. Much fortunately, I called Indigo and got connected to this very helpful person who was so patient with my panic state and assisted me with all my queries and infact rescheduled the tickets considering they were booked a few minutes ago. I cannot thank this person and Indigo enough to explain how helpful they were towards my situation and how efficiently they fixed this issues.",0
2019,"Delhi to Istanbul via Doha. We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on. But the crew instead of sending them back to their seat, make them sit in the first row, which is a paid row.",1
2019,"Bengaluru to Jaipur. I had done web check in and had my boarding pass as pdf in my phone as I couldn't get a print out. Upon reaching the airport I was not allowed to print the boarding pass, they didn't have to give the boarding pass, just print the pdf that I had. The worst part is if they had not wasted my time in queues when I had already mentioned I was in a hurry, I could have gone outside and gotten a printout. I missed my flight just because I didn't have a printout of my boarding pass, even though I had the pdf. There has to be some understanding, they should guide us properly.",1
2019,"Jaipur to Lucknow. I got what was expected and that was low cost flying, and the flight was on time and that's what really matters. The crew was courteous and overall an average flight experience however some seat covers were torn. I hope they clean their aircraft before flights.",1
2019,"Jaipur to Mumbai. Ticket was booked under corporate fare with meal included. Flight time was 5.20pm and total duration from Jaipur to Mumbai was 1hr 55 min. The cabin crew started serving refreshments at 5.50pm. my seat was 20A. The cabin crew reached my seat at 6.40pm (15 mins prior to landing, the first officer announced landing time of 6.55 pm). The meal was complimentary and being corporate meal it should have been ready but the cabin crew member said she will get back to me with chicken sandwich which she never came back. She even refused to serve anything hot (beverage and/or meal) to me and few other passengers on seats nearby my seat since we were near to landing time. How was it passengers fault that meal was served or about to be served at time of landing. I raised this issue with the cabin crew head and all I got as meal after landing while getting out of aircraft was a box of cashew nuts.",1
2019,"Male to Mumbai. 3hr flight with 1 class only - no premium or business. Crew is very nice and service oriented although its a low cost airline. We booked what they called 6E - food, drinks and priority during tickets reservation. We got a rice (spicy) and soft drinks. I would not say it was good and for our kids they served the same - so it was kind of waste if time and money - no entertainment on board.",1
2019,"Kolkata to Delhi. I have been in India for few months and travelled with Indigo few times, and I have always had a lovely experience until today. Ive arrived to Kolkata. As I went to drop my bag at the check-in desk, a barrier was lower, so I took a shortcut and stepped over it. Straight after staff come up to me and with a intimidating attitude asked me: is everything ok?! At first I didnt realise, but then I told me in that I should not step over the barrier as a matter of security. Honestly I felt very embarrassed, so I apologies. Few seconds after I saw some older guy doing it, but staff looked away. Then another guy did it in front of him, and staff smiled away. So I asked staff why it was ok for some people to do it and not for me? It was then become aggressive and rude, so I decide to let the argument go. He should be fair with all, no just pick arguments with foreigners so that he can feel good and embarrassing customer in front of all. I hope Indigo can address this with staff and provide him with a customer service training. He is the face of Indigo when people arrive at the airport, and people like him can ruin the reputation of Indigo. Then on the flight they didnt have changed for cash payments and instead wanted me to buy more things. That was pathetic, they offer a service they should make sure they have changed, it was the first flight in the morning and I was seating 1st row and they didnt have changes.",1
2019,Tutocurin to Chennai with IndiGo. Very pathetic. Very unprofessional in handling the excess weight. Felt like I was cheated. I have almost traveled with all major airlines but have never had such a bad experience as today with Indigo. I would give minus five stars if I have the option to do so.,1
2019,Jaipur to Bangalore via Mumbai. We were a group of 6 students who happened to miss our flight. The IndiGo staff at the Jaipur airport as well as the security were all really helpful and they helped us get through the critical situation. They were with us till the issue got solved. We will never forget this experience which was turned into a pleasant one by the IndiGo staff.,0
2019,Bangalore to Udaipur. The flight was 25 minutes delayed. During the flight too the cabin crew was rushing about offering snacks to getting the money from the customers.  I felt uncomfortable with the crew behavior during the entire flight. I will try to look for better service in the future.,1
2019,"Udaipur to Mumbai. Beautiful blue plane, one of the best low cost airlines in India. route goes to every corner of India. Flew from a small city to Mumbai, the whole journey was excellent from staff welcoming on board until landing. On time as well. There is no reason to give a score under 10. Worth this price.",0
2019,"Hyderabad to Rajahmundry. The staff in both locations was very pleasant and helpful. They went out of their way to accomodate me. I left my laptop and phone in the security check line because I got distracted by all the rigorous questions asked by the security personnel and my stuff got separated from my bags they were checking, so I did not realize I did not put the laptop and phone back in my bag. On the plane I finally realized and we started calling the lost and found at the airport in Hyderabad. They were closed because it was Sunday. In Rajahmundry we spoke with IndiGo personnel and the airport manager who helped me get hold of someone from the airline in Hyderabad and assure me that my articles are secure with them. They even offered to send my stuff via a next available flight but I was coming back the next day, so I was just willing to pick it up then. In Hyderabad staff were very pleasant and helpful and quickly gave me my articles after checking my identity. Someone from Indigo actually went to the security, got my stuff and kept it at the counter. Everyone went above and beyond and I quickly got everything back but knowing that my stuff was safe waiting for me on a Sunday night was very reassuring and stress relieving. Thank you, IndiGo staff. I am not familiar with airlines in India but I would recommend them to anyone who is traveling within the country.",0
2019,They rescheduled my flight 3 times without offering any accommodation and even apologizes. They did it at the very last moment when I already couldnt book another flight from normal company. I payed for direct 6 hours flight from Delhi to Istanbul. Finally they operated 9 hours with a stop in Doha when they even didnt let passengers to come out from the aircraft!!,1
2019,"Indigo flight from Bengaluru to Mumbai. Due to the flight schedule modifications due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts, I had to do a last minute booking on Indigo which came at a steep price but as I was required to travel had no other choice. The check-in was a breeze and boarding / departure started on time. The aircraft was well maintained and even though every seat was practically full, the crew did well to manage things and requests from fellow passengers. The seat pitch is around 30 inches which is decent enough but might be more uncomfortable for someone taller. The flight was very smooth and the crew were very pleasant and indulged in small talk among the passengers when it came for the in-flight snacks which were kind of pricey. Arrival was on time and the captain of the flight announced that this was his last flight and so all the passengers were requested to send their best wishes to the captain during de-boarding which was a nice touch. A very pleasant flight experience indeed. Thank you Indigo.",0
2019,"Flew from Mumbai to Bangalore last week. Opted for IndiGo as the timings were good, Check in was a little slow and so was boarding - their staff at the gates was asking people to check their bags in at the boarding gate so there was some confusion. The aircraft was a slightly older one. Seats were okay, since this was a corporate booking, got a XL seat over the wings. Meal was pre-added as a corporate booking perk - food was ok, had to remind the staff for a cup of tea. Never got one as when the crew did care to drop by, the pilot had already announced them to secure for landing.",1
2019,"Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. I had paid for FF package so checkin was smooth even though baggage allowance was 20kg on ticket but they allow me to carry extra as a result my one hand bag went inside so i was free to walk on airport. I got checkin lounge where i can rest and have some food at odd hours and went to gate, boarding was already open one hour before departure and we were on our seat 30 minutes and gate close as every one had boarded. Boarding was smooth no drama. Flight was ready for take off and at that time it was advise that there is problem with aircraft and hence the flight need to abandon and change of aircraft and brought aircraft back to gate. Spend another 3 hours and finally took off. I can say that they had managed transition very smoothly. Aircraft were clean and toilets were clean too. staff were smiling and food was nice tea and upma which was preordered. Flight landed on time. Cant ask more on budget airline so it all depends upon what you pay upfront to get service.",0
2019,"My 10-year old daughter had come down with traveller's diarrhea when we were about to take a flight with Indigo Airlines from Ahmedabad to Mumbai. By the time we were checking in it had become apparent that she was in no condition to fly. Fortunately to us, an employee of Indigo Airlines saw that my daughter was suffering. He invited us to an empty office where a short time later we were met by a doctor who examined my daughter and gave us medication and electrolytes. As a result my daughter's condition improved and we were able to take the flight after all. The help that we received was initiated by the attentive and very friendly Indigo Airlines staff. It was quick and un-bureaucratic with attention to detail (the staff organized a wheelchair and gave my daughter and us expedited access to the plain). We are very thankful for the assistance we received.",0
2019,"Indore to Bengaluru. Horrible service at check in counter. I had my flight which was delayed 25 minutes. As I was scared of missing my international connection due to the delay, I asked the staff to put my baggage under priority for releasing on the belt (due to the delay of the flight). Airline staff asked for payment for priority baggage, though the reason was clearly the delay in the flight.",1
2019,Bangkok to Coimbatore via Chennai. Flight was delayed 4 times then cancelled. They had 1 member of staff trying to rebook around 250 passengers. Not even water was provided while flights were rebooked (which took 7 hours). Only 150ml of water was given onboard the aircraft which we were on for 4 hours before being deplaned when they cancelled the flight. Luggage was then not sent to the destinations. It took 5 days to get my luggage back and they wouldnt even deliver it. I had to return to the airport.,1
2019,"I was disappointed with the delay, flight was 30 minutes delayed while going from Sharjah to Trivandrum and a one hour delay on return to Sharjah. I booked Indigo for an on time flight but its a false image. Worst experience, airline didn't even inform us about the delay through an SMS or any other means. Waste of time. Attitude of crew is the worst. They should learn to respect passengers.",1
2019,"On May 30th, 2018 my husband, mother and myself were supposed to catch our flight from Delhi to Goa with Indigo. However, the day before our flight we received a message stating that our terminal had changed due to renovations in the airport. My husband had called the airlines to confirm and was told that our terminal had in fact changed. Once we arrived at the Delhi airport, security wouldnt let us inside the airport and he kept telling us we were in the wrong terminal. We told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change, but he still didnt want to let us in and asked us to go to the Indigo customer care outside of the airport. When we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one Indigo agent that was there. After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he cant help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to deal with us that was even less helpful. By this time, boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldnt do anything. We asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that. She said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed. By this time, all early flights were gone, and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to Goa for May 30th were booked. We booked our flight with Fly Air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at Delhi. We called the hotel in Goa to advise them we wouldnt make it to the hotel that day, but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day, but unfortunately we couldnt. Because of the service from Indigo airlines and wrong information given to us by them, we had to spend 6 times the price of our original flights, lost 1 day of hotel in Goa and had to book another extra night in Delhi.",1
2019,"Goa to Singapore via Hubli and Bangalore. Big respect to the ground service crew of Indigo Airlines (Pratik, Tufeeq, Errana, Arpita and Sayed). They helped me big time at Hubli when I was landing from a flight from Goa. I lost my bag with my wallet (credit card, cash) in the airport Goa and realised the disaster when I was in Hubli, no wallet so no money, can't take the taxi to go to the hotel, it was midnight the airport was closing and the policemen started talking to me, big trouble, big time!! This is here than the amazing team of Indigo Airlines help me to get out of trouble. First, we went to the restaurant where they offered me a dish then they provided me a room for the night, on the morning they provided the breakfast, then they drove me to the city center where I was able to withdrawal some money through Western Union and finally drove me back to the airport at Hubli where I took my next flight to Bengaluru. Without their incredible help, I don't know what would have happened... so big thank you to all the team of Indigo Airlines.",0
2019,"Hong Kong to Jaipur via Bangalore. Today in Hong Kong I arrived at checked in online and joined the checkin queue well before the stated checkin closing time of 7.30am, there was a long que. I finally made it to the counter at 8.11am and noticed the only 2 checkin agents were now panicking as the flight due to depart at 8.40 needed to close. Passport and visa were presented, boarding pass printed however the agent then required details of my departure from India, fare enough. I took around 1 minute to pull up those details on my MacBook - a reasonable time frame however the agent in charge elected to close the flight, instructed our boarding passes be ripped up and even though I showed the departure details was met with a sorry flight closed approach and checkin agents walking away. Is that good customer service? Or am I right in saying IndiGo need more checkin agents to process passengers on time?",1
2019,I was not well and asked for water 4 times even when the staff was serving i asked for water. They were only concentrating on people who had ordered for food! After paying so much money to these airline companies with hefty amount of service taxes this is the kind of service we get? in a 2 hrs flight i kept asking for water by pressing the service button twice but I was not entertained.,1
2019,"Trivandrum to Doha. Terrible experience with booking process and customer service from the airline. We were given wrong information by staff and we were denied boarding for our flight because apparently there was no transfer desk at our transit airport! It cost us our return ticket, unnecessary stress at the airport, and an extra USD $2000 for alternative and last minute flights to make it back home. Upon returning home, we made several attempts to reach management to address our case - the responses were slow (if any) and unprofessional with no attention to our case. We received standard replies and it has been almost a month now since we have received any updates about our complaint.",1
2019,Delhi to Dubai. I have been a frequent flyer with Indigo. I appreciate the timings comfort and services. Most annoying and embarrassing is when you want to pay by card 99% of cases it's declined.,0
2019,"Delhi to Jaipur. Catastrophic reservation system and customer cervice I have booked a fully flexible return ticket online (via iPhone) on Jan 1st 2019, for departure in early Feb'19. The booking process is extremely cumbersome, also it seems to be mandatory to pay for every single aisle seat on this airline. All payment options for international passengers incur convenience fees which is extremely annoying. On Jan 3rd, needed to change the return flight. Tried to do so online but in vain, the online portal just returned cryptic error messages. Sent an Email to Customer Service asking for advise to change flights as its not possible online. Promptly, on Jan 4th received a response which was completely unrelated and misleading, incl the proposal to contact their domestic call center for further help. Went down to their local agent & explained the issue. Nevertheless they talked me though the online process again. When I was about to leave their office I was told that online modifications only work using the Google Chrome browser. Just cancelled the entire booking and won't consider IndiGo ever again even without ever flying with them. What a terrible airline.",1
2019,Delhi to Bengaluru. The flight was supposed to depart at 9:35 am but was delayed to 12:35pm. Me and my husband had a Goair flight to catch from Bengaluru to Kannur at 14:40 hrs. Firstly we missed the Kannur flight and secondly the flight took off from Delhi after another 1.5 hrs delay. No screening of appropriate timings or scheduled departure. No announcements to confirm delays. We were rerouted to Mangalore but had to stay in Mangalore without any compensation.,1
2019,Chennai to Singapore. I faced a nightmare with the booking I made with this airline for later in January 2019. One of the worst booking system this airline is using. I faced 3 times payment declined with international credit cards. One time payment deducted and took several days to get the refund. Again I had nightmare when I tried to purchase seat selection via visa CC issued by overseas bank.  I never had such a bad experience in 20 years of travelling.,1
2018,Ahmedabad to Bengaluru. The flight was delayed by an hour with no announcements to indicate the reason. Bad time management and customer service. Spicejet is much better and would recommend it over Indigo any day.,1
2018,"Ahmedabad to Nagpur. No time management skills. they changed the gate number at the end moment no announcements were made. We were asked to stay in line for almost 1 to 1.5 hours. The flight was not on time. Will not travel on this flight again, worst experience ever.",1
2018,Flew IndiGo from Bangalore to Thiruvananthapuram. The flight was 2 hours late upon departure. Boarding was already 1:30 hours late and an additional half hour waiting time in the plane. My 3rd delay experience with IndiGo. Extremely unprofessional service.,1
2018,"Guwahati to Hyderabad. I was charged a Rs 400 for an extra baggage of mere 1.5 kg. I paid the money. They charge on each and every service provided, however the customer care is pathetic. My flight is 2 hrs delayed and we are not compensated for that. If you can charge us on anything you like then we should be compensated as refund as well.  Baggage surcharges must be cut down.",1
2018,"Dubai to Mumbai. I paid for non-veg snacks and they say mam we are only left with sandwiches Why should i care what are you left with, what I ordered for should be served. The refreshments were served after 1.5 hours. Ill never travel again by indigo and even wont suggest anyone !",1
2018,"Pune to Ahmedabad. Although Indigo is good in time management and on time departure, they have deteriorated in terms of customer service.  Although the flight was on time, it took 52 mins to receive the luggage. Also it was surprising that they put the luggage of two adjacently arriving flights on the same belt. This is just not to allow the belt to remain empty. The luggage keeps coming so much less in number and the passengers keep staring at the belt expecting their luggage to come.The attitude of the ground staff is rude.  Also the crew members are not friendly enough.  KPI of ""on time"" is important as a performance indicator but should not be at the cost of passenger satisfaction.",1
2018,"I flew with my family from Delhi to Guwahati. Indigo crew were super friendly and the flight was pretty comfortable. Service was good and attendants responded to requests, although the aircraft was nearly full. One of the hostess was nice enough and very professional, she actually made small talk with me about their service. Their smiling face and nice humor made our travels much more pleasant.",0
2018,Delhi to Jaipur. My flight was rescheduled without information and staff was rude. I was a regular traveller but this incident ruined my day and no initiative by the staff to satisfy the customer. I had an important meeting which was missed. Would never travel with indigo again,1
2018,"Bengaluru to Visakhapatnam via Chennai. I had a flight from Bangalore to Visakhapatnam on the morning of 6th and my return was planned the same day around night timeframe i.e 9pm. And the airlines sends an email to me on 4th that they had changed the schedule of my flight from Bangalore to evening 5.55 pm. I do not understand , why nobody from the airlines did not bother to check when my return flight was and why they did not call me and instead just sent an email. Luckily, i checked my mail on sunday the 4th, otherwise my whole travel plan would have been jeopardized. And when i call the support number, that person says there are two options - 1. He can cancel and refund or change the flight to take flights with layover in between And when i said i need to be in Vizag in the morning, he suggested a flight in the midnight i.e at 00.05 hours from Bangalore to Chennai and that the connecting flight to Vizag would be from Chennai in the morning at 6.50 i.e with a layover of 5 hours and when i asked if indigo can make any lounge arrangement for those 5 hours, he says that Indigo cannot help in that regard and that i need to take care of the stay during the layover. Since the airline changed the flight schedule, they should at least compensate with an arrangement to stay during the layover -  (if we change they charge difference or if we cancel, they have t&c that there will be percentage deduction in the refunded amount. But if it is their fault they do not bother about what the passenger is going through)",1
2018,"Absolutely inflexible airline and understaffed. There was a misprint in the name due to auto-correct. I showed 3 different IDs (passport, driver's license from India, driver's license from another country) so that they can correct my name but to no avail. They are completely understaffed and unprofessional about handling the case. It took 40 minutes just to reach the ticketing counter to explain my case and then I was left with over 1 hour before departure. Rather than trying to fix the issue, they were just trying to get more money by asking me to book a fresh ticket. Since this was happening 1 hour before departure, I could not even cancel my ticket. Had they been quick about it, I could have corrected the issue and boarded the flight. But instead, I had to book a new ticket for an airline later in the day and lost money on the previous one too. With a security lapse, I was allowed in the airport(name on ID not matching my ticket). This was surprising in the first place. Rather taking this case to fix their security issues, they were still bent on just asking me to book a fresh ticket. No wonder there is a huge room for improvement. But instead of fixing those, the involved people are just concerned about extracting money from consumers. Absolutely unsatisfied with the situation.",1
2018,"I was flying from Dubai to Bangalore and the luggage policy is 30 kgs check-in and 7 kgs hand luggage.  My check-in luggage was 22 kgs and I thought I would move my extra kgs to the check-in, but at the check-in counter, even though I put both pieces of luggage together the guy told me, its ok, you can put it down and didnt ask to measure my hand luggage which is what they normally do. However, after immigration and security, just when I was about to board the flight, they had another scale and were measuring the handbags and wanted me to pay 60 AED (1100 Rs) per kg. They said if I dont pay I cannot get on the flight. They were even charging people for stuff they bought in Duty-free.",1
2018,"We had to face a serious issue with our connecting flight from Kolkata to Delhi. We checked in along with our luggage around 2am in the morning for our 6.05am flights to Delhi. However, unfortunately, we still missed our flights.We walked in when the flight status was still showing as ""boarding"", there were no last/final call shown on the flight status. We were not let to board because we were ""3 mins late"" for boarding. We were unaware that the CCU airport is a silent airport as other Indigo flight boarding were announced since we were listening intently awaiting our boarding call. We saw the last bus standing and we pleaded to let us in, the woman officer wanted us to let in but the male officer was arrogant and said no. The moment they heard that we are foreigners, they realized their mistake but they did nothing to correct it or help us out in any manner. They took the time to send back our luggage instead. Finally, we had to get fresh new tickets from another airlines that cost us Rs 5,900 additionally. Other than this incident, our entire flight experience was good. I hope that this matter is looked into and taken care of.",1
2018,"I used Indigo for the first time yesterday. All went very well but for the very last leg back to Chennai. I had requested a wheelchair for all legs of the journey but nothing turned up in Chennai! Eventually the crew left, the Captain left, Co-pilot gone, I had been told to wait so eventually I asked again and the ground staff man said everyone was gone! Yes I said, except me! So after a long wait someone turned up with a child's wheelchair! I'm 6 foot plus! After a further long wait a wheelchair turned up. Surely any staff must ensure that passengers are taken care of before leaving the vessel for their own comfort.",0
2018,"Hyderabad to Sharjah. Shortly after boarding the above flight I was having dizziness. After 2 hrs of boarding, I realized the vomiting sensation & was prepared to use the Toilet & in front of Toilet I collapsed like a Blackout. However, the flight crew done everything by calmly and professionally organizing medical attention. Cabin crew made an announcement to other Co passengers, if any Dr available to take care of him and luckily Dr was available & he checked everything & made me more comfortable. Indigo is indeed a very professional and caring organization.",0
2018,"I had the opportunity to fly with IndiGo on the 15th of August 2018 from Doha to Mumbai. Always having flown Qatar Airways I had to choose IndiGo due to the time slot. Well, a low cost airline in really had no expectations but at least a decent and hassle free experience as they claim to give. I checked in at the counters and got my boarding pass and I had a handbag of 6kgs which is well below their limit of 7kgs. I purchased duty free which was about 3 kgs. Here comes the tricky part the staff at the boarding gate have a portable weighing scale through which they check the weight of the handbags. I have no issues with that however I wasnt informed at the counters about 7kgs handbag allowance being inclusive of duty free. The staff at the boarding gate (QAS) staff, were rude they do not even try to be polite of courteous and straight away give ultimatums saying throw away the duty free, go back to duty free and return it, however if you do no return in 20 minutes we will offload you from the flight. They forced me to pay 60 riyal per kg for the excess baggage which I was carrying. I wouldnt recommend this airline unless a last resort or a complete emergency. One can only expect low quality service from a low cost airline. Thank you IndiGo for the hassle free experience.",1
2018,Singapore to Pune via Chennai. It was reasonably good flight. Specially it was on time. Connection was swift. Ground staff was little rude but cabin staff was very good. I think it was quite value for money service as it was cheap ticket to Singapore. Quite minimalist flight service as expected for a cheap ticket. Overall experience was good and will definitely give it a go next time. Thanks.,0
2018,Mumbai to Kochi. On time. Not a minute late. Everything was on time. Service is great. Food options are limited. The blue is very pleasing to the eye. Well-organised and a reliable airline. Totally recommend it.,0
2018,"Delhi to Coimbatore. I have flown with Indigo loads of times and have regularly recommended it to many. I have never had a bad experience in all of my trips and was really happy until my recent trip. I had booked my seats under student discount which allowed an additional baggage of 10kgs free of charge. During my through leg from DEL to CJB, this promotion was honored and I paid for whatever excess I had, (excluding the 15kg+10kg allowance). But they would not agree that I had this promotion during my return leg and would not agree or believe me that I availed this in my first leg. I was astounded when the rep said there was nothing in the notes regarding the promotion. How can it be possible that you allow different baggage allocations for different legs. I ended up paying for the excess baggage which I had packed in anticipation of availing the 10 kg student discount. It was never about the money for me, but Indigo let me down in not acknowledging my promotion status.",1
2018,"I was travelling from Delhi to Vadodara in July 2018 through Indigo. Unfortunately, our flight from San Francisco to Delhi (Via Shanghai) got delayed and we missed the 5:10 am flight from Delhi to Vadodara. The Indigo staff at terminal 2 acted very helpful. They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi. We barely reached to Terminal at 6:35 am. We had to get our tickets modified, checked in and boarding passes printed by 6:40 am to get into the Ahemdabad flight. That is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state. I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed. In couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance. She ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast. Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time! Then she ran with us to the security area, asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate. We got to the gate as last passengers entering! We could not have done it without this staff. We now realized why Indigo is such a great airline. it is because of the great employees.",0
2018,Mumbai to Udaipur. Excellent service and Air Hostess were polite and helpful. It was a really nice flight.Thanks to Pilot and the Crew members. We enjoyed our trip.,0
2018,"Delhi to Visakhapatnam. Good service and price. But why not charge 200-300 extra on any flight and serve a free meal. Snacks are ok but a meal will do better . Also , moving to terminal 2 at Delhi Airport was not a good idea. No Windows to watch outside for those who love plane-spotting. Also, there are no good passenger facilities available in terminal 2.",0
2018,"Bhubaneswar to Mumbai via Hyderabad. As usual, full marks for their service in the aircraft. From check-in to the boarding (although flight was delayed due to bad weather in Bhubaneswar), they also gave constant updates about the status of the plane's arrival also. Otherwise, no complaints at all about their service .",0
2018,"Dehradun to Pune via Delhi. Most disorganized and inefficient airline I have ever travelled with. Multiple delays, standing in line for over 8+ hours and talking with customer service on the phone for 5+ hours with no help at all. Do not fly with this airline.",1
2018,"Doha to Kochi. The check in staff were unprofessional and impolite. I had an excess baggage of 5kg which I took back and repacked without any hesitation, Yet they behaved as if I was handling drugs. I took back only one baggage to repack, leaving the other to them to check in. Coming back after repacking which is a struggle at the airport , these check in staff kept yelling why I kept the bag there.",1
2018,"Bhubaneshwar to Mumbai. IndiGo, being a low-cost no-frills airline is a value for money indeed. Although their in-flight menu is bit expensive, one can bring their food from home also, which also save some money. From ground handling to the crews' services, it was an excellent service. The students fare scheme is a boon indeed. Being a student, I always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6% basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance. I also prefer this airlines as they are the most punctual airlines. Looking forward to travel on IndiGo.",0
2018,Me and my wife were travelling to Bangalore from Goa on 8th May 6E 281. The check-in agent noticed my wife is pregnant and was very helpful. She changed us to more comfortable seats and offered to check-in our carry on luggage. We are very happy with this sweet gesture and is much appreciated.,0
2018,Flew Coimbatore to Delhi. First of all thank you IndiGo for such caring staff. My daughter met with an accident and her left arm was affected. She had treatment from Ganga medical center Coimbatore. She was carrying an extension rod attached to her arm. We had three tickets but of different nos. The air hostess took proper care with arranging front seats for us. She made her relax throughout the journey.,1
2018,Coimbatore to Delhi. First of all thank you for such a caring staff. My daughter met with an accident and her left arm was affected.  She was carrying extension rod attached to her arm. We were having three tickets but of different nos. Air hostess took proper care for arranging front seats for us. She helped her relax throughout the journey.,1
2018,Delhi to Bangalore. I was traveling with someone who was visually impaired. And when I reached the check in the girl on the other side was helpful to provide us with assistance.  She was excellent. She took good care of the specially enabled person with me and ensued that we were made to sit on the plane. Not only this she also helped so many passengers with all their queries. Keep it up and god bless you.,0
2018,Mumbai to Raipur. The fare for extra luggage is too high. No food is provided during travelling. I dont think its worth paying 6000 for each flight and not getting any facilities.  Please improve your service.,1
2018,"I travel with Indigo a lot and about half the time I regret it. They have all sorts of arbitrary rules that don't affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience. For example, a few times I've arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day. Every time they refuse despite having plenty of space - apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing. Today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg. Why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane? Lack of flexibility and customer orientation on this airline is consistently staggeringly bad. And it really irritates my sense of efficiency and reasonableness.",1
2018,"Kochi to Hyderabad via Mumbai. I earlier travelled to cochin, it was delayed by 1.3 hours. This time they directly rescheduled my travel. I was supposed to travel from Cochin to Hyderabad via Chennai. But they had rerouted me to Mumbai then to Hyderabad. Before rescheduling directly they should have given me options of cancellation or showing next available flight options. I got delayed by more than 5 hours. Who would want to suffer without sleep for purely airlines mistake?  When i ask for compensation they  say you should have called before starting your travel.",1
2018,Bangalore to Singapore. Horrible experience with check in staff at Bangalore. We had an onward flight from Singapore to Jakarta on Singapore Airlines. The check in staff refused to check us in saying we did not have Singapore visas. We explained that we were transiting at Singapore so did not need a visa. They refused to accept. I explained that at Singapore it is possible to freely transfer between terminals T2 & T3 without needing to pass Immigration. They refused to agree and insisted we required a Singapore visa. After much discussion they allowed us to board after they realized we possessed valid US & other visas. Wereached Singapore and there is no requirement to pass Immigration. Imagine if we did not possess other visas- would we have not been allowed to travel. Sad to see the poor quality of ground staff at Indigo.,1
2018,"Udaipur to Dubai via Delhi. I was travelling with my spouse, mother and infant. Udaipur - Delhi flight was delayed more than 2.5 hours and because of this I missed my Delhi - Dubai flight. No one from IndiGo was there to assist, I struggled for 5 hours at Delhi airport with my kid, they made me run between the counters. After struggle of whole night they arranged to fly in another flight but only for two people, I had to travel with my kid and mother leaving my spouse at Delhi airport. They arranged a flight for my spouse after 12 hours.",1
2018,"I am a frequent domestic flyer and several times I have traveled with IndiGo. Apart from one or two exceptions, every time the flight I booked was cancelled and I was re-booked on another flight. It was alright when the re-booking was done for another flight at the same time but lately the re-booked flights are at very inconvenient times. As a female passenger traveling alone, I could not accept the revised time of 21.50 reaching my destination at 23.05 for my last booked flight. The only other alternative for me is a flight one day later. Not to mention the unexpected delays in airport. I do not recommend IndiGo flights. The chances of getting your entire schedule messed up is pretty high with Indigo.",1
2018,My wife travelled on Indigo flight 6E-459 from Mumbai to Chennai on 20/3/2018. She arrived late at the airport in Mumbai. There was a flash strike by Uber which she booked earlier and she had to take an auto at the last moment to travel from Thane to the domestic airport. The Indigo staff at the Mumbai airport were very helpful in arranging to board the aircraft at the last moment. She was travelling alone and had no knowledge of Hindi. The Ground staff of Indigo also arranged to send her luggage in another aircraft travelling to Chennai. We had a few tense moments till she arrived safely here at Chennai. To our pleasant surprise the baggage was also delivered personally by Indigo staff at Chennai within an hour. I wish to place on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to all the Indigo staff who helped her out both at Mumbai and Chennai.,0
2018,Trivandrum to Bangalore. Airline provided special consideration to families with small kids so we also got the preference on boarding the flight first. The kids were provided with small Indigo passports by the hostess. The Kids and we as a family enjoyed the flight. We were provided with soft drinks and in one hour we landed at the Bangalore Airport. It was a good customer service from Indigo,0
2018,"Dimapur to Bangalore via Kolkata. I flew with IndiGo and received exemplary service. On my previous flights on IndiGo as well as Dimapur to Kolkata leg of this flight, I had inquired about buying the ""Girl Power"" Lapel Pin for my daughter and was told every time ""not available"". I inquired on this flight as well and the pin wasn't available but seeing the disappointment in my eyes, cabin crew  immediately took off the Girl Power badge off her uniform and gave it to me. This level of service and concern is exemplary and way beyond call of duty - kudos  for her generosity and to IndiGo for nurturing employees like her - way to go!",0
2018,"Chennai to Hyderabad and Hyderabad to Bangalore in February. Very pleased with this airline, clean aircraft, on time service, no luggage issues. I booked this trip from the US and everything worked out without any issues. Excellent value for money and way better than full service airlines I have flown within India.",0
2018,"My umpteenth flight with IndiGo in the past four years, almost always Bangkok-Pune-Bangkok via Calcutta. As always exemplary cabin service, efficient check in service. This time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb: I checked in and was asked if I had a PowerPac in my luggage and I said no. While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board! A exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an IndiGo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal. Many many thanks. On the downside, no Foreigner Arrival Cards on board the flight from BKK to Cal and no Thai immigration forms on the flight from Cal to BKK.",0
2018,"Dubai to Singapore via Chennai. New aircraft, very professional cabin crew. They assist me at the check in to put my luggage to Singapore via Chennai. Transit in Chennai was very smooth despite the procedures of Indian police - checking three times our passports but all went ok. On time flights. I will fly with them on this route if needed.",0
2018,"Flew IndiGo from Kolkata to New Delhi. The check-in process was smooth and the baggage handling went well. I later found out as I had a ""Lite"" ticket, which was cheaper, I had to pay extra for my checked baggage. I did that. A bus took us to our aircraft. The plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time. The seats were a bit tight and legroom wasn't that good so I was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight. The head-rest of the seat also wasn't that comfortable. But you know, you can't expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrow-body type. With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle. The plane's air-conditioning had troubles, so it was a bit hot. At last, the plane landed on New Delhi after 2hr 5min. Experience could have been a little better even if it was economy-class.",0
2018,Mumbai to Bangalore. This is the second time I'm booking Indigo from Mumbai and both times the flight was delayed. The scheduled take off was 1545h and take off was 1725h for the flight. Both times I've missed being where I was supposed to on time.,1
2018,"Flew IndiGo from Chennai to Madurai. The flight was a pretty short one, one hour. During that time, these are the things that I felt about the airline. 1) Check In: The Lines were long, the number of counters were pretty reasonable but could be increased considering the number of flights IndiGo operates. My advice, arrive early. 2) Aircraft: Neat. Clean aircraft. No problems. 3) Crew service: Pretty good. Up to standards. 4) Ground Support: I didn't face any trouble and the staff were pretty helpful too. 5) On Board Meal: it's not complementary. You have to buy it. Tasted good for the money. 6) Punctuality: On-time. No issues there. 7) Communications: Book online. You would get all the information via SMS, even the boarding gate information.",0
2018,"Chennai to Raipur via Hyderabad. Indigo is being quite careless these days, they mess up things and all we get to hear is ""sorry for the inconvenience mam"". Recently While booking the tickets i had selected a XL seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance, but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the XL seats including my father's, so today when we went to get our boarding passes, they said sorry mam, all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is, you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money. Its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through. Why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people can't handle it properly.",0
2017,Bangalore to Mumbai. My flight 6E 464 was scheduled for departure at 9:20am on 30 December and is finally boarding at 3:45 pm. In between this many flights for Mumbai has flown and Indigo crew remained clueless about this particular flight and spoke rude to passengers who we're enquiring. After the delay till 2:40pm the airline stopped sending any information to passengers via SMS or call.  At some point we were thinking as if we were waiting for some imaginary flight!  The refreshments were announced only at 12:30pm when most passengers had arranged their meals.,1
2017,Indigo flight scheduled at 9:30am from Hyderabad to Ranchi has been delayed 3 hours 30 minutes on December 25th 2017. I am still not sure how long it would take me to finally board my flight today. I have a family event to attend but I think I won't be able to attend it.  It would be a customer delight if airline respects passengers valuable time and value for money. I have been a valued indigo customer but today I am sorry to say indigo customer centric ideologies are fading away these days.,1
2017,"Kolkata to Mumbai. I had a wheelchair passenger. Indigo provided no help getting onto the flight to Mumbai on Nov, 15. She had to walk to the gate. They issued the boarding pass but didn't wait for us and closed the gate 35 minutes before departure. They then charged me extra Rs.6500 to get us on to another flight. I have noticed the exact same happening to another senior citizen couple at the Mumbai airport on Nov 28th. When I objected they issued two tickets to the couple for free. Indigo seems to be cheating elderly people using this technique.",1
2017,"Hyderabad to Bengaluru. Travel time, check in procedure, check out procedure and baggage collection are smooth and good. Inside flight service is not good. Our company has booked the ticket along with meals as well. I am not aware of it. I didn't check my boarding pass properly for special service. Crew members did not inform me about my meals while going to Bangalore. In return journey to Hyderabad they provided 1 cookies box (Rs.50/-). +1coke (Rs.100/-). We pay more money for meals at the time of booking, while not receiving the service we paid for.",0
2017,Had one of the worst experiences with IndiGo during a very critical moment. We had booked our flight 3 months ago. Our flight was from Trivandrum to Patna via Bengaluru. While we wer in Thiruvananthapuram we got a phone call from IndiGo 2 days prior to our departure saying that one my flights has been canceled and other one rescheduled. I was suppose to leave Trivandrum at 8:00 am and reach Patna by 3:00pm afternoon and we had to travel all the way to Nepal in order to attend a meeting on the very next day. IndiGo screwed us very bad and said they will provide us with a different flight but both on separate days. Now I am here in Trivandrum airport one day earlier to my actual departure and waiting for my flight which has been delayed once again. Now I will reach Bengaluru at midnight where I have to stay for 12 hours waiting for my next flight. Now my time and money are completely wasted. Staying over night in Bengaluru costs minimum 5000 and on top I'm stuck here wasting my time when I had to attend a party. This will be last and final flight that I will book with IndiGo.,1
2017,"Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata. As usual on this run, a route I have flown close to 30 times in the past 6 years, an almost-flawless flight. The only problem being no arrival cards on board for non-Indian nationals thus needlessly spending a much longer time in queue at Kolkata immigration. Other than that, an impeccable flight, especially the superb cabin crew.",0
2017,Goa to Mumbai. It was a worst experience we had at Goa airport while travelling back to Bombay. We got to Indigo counter at 43mins prior. However we were denied for boarding as we were 2 mins late and were asked to pay difference of 10500Rs for next flight. We tried requesting the ground staff but they were arrogant and didn't show any respect or courtesy. It seemed like we have to live on their mercy to get on board to get back to Bombay. As it was way below self respect we decided to book another flight with Air India and got back home. It was most inferior action by the Indigo staff which could have been avoided.,1
2017,Bangalore to Mumbai. I was not feeling well and air hostess provided me as much help as she can during my  journey. I am very much impressed with this behavior of staff towards passengers and I will be a frequent flyer of indigo. Thanks Indigo for choosing such a helpful and lovely staff,0
2017,"Vishakapatnam to Delhi via Hyderabad.  An earlier direct flight finished boarding and was not full. They wouldn't let us on that flight despite having sufficient space for absolutely no reason. A systems or customer service problem I'm not sure. But a plane just took off that we could have been in, and now we get to sit in airplanes for an absolutely needless 5 more hours. Awesome.",1
2017,"Journey from Kochi to Dubai, seats were pretty cramped, we asked for an aisle seat and the adjacent seat to that (middle seat in this case as it was 3x3) but they gave us both an aisle seat, that was still ok, the passage area was not wide enough as you have to adjust yourself when an air hostess passes through. The seat was well cramped the storage area was good, its a budget airlines with the cost of ticket of a normal airlines, only benefit was that we have 30 kgs each. The storage area on above the seats was pretty wide. Staff and service was pretty average - average experience.",1
2017,"Dubai to Trivandrum. We had a eventful day flying from Dubai to Trivandrum, first upon check in we were told that we lacked a return ticket out of the country so our visa would not be valid. The check in lady was very friendly and explained it very calmly. So my son and I went to book a flight out of the country, returned to the check in counter, where the lady saw us and waved us over and let us jump the que. We proceeded to security where the staff was friendly and gave clear directions to passengers who did not know the rules yet. After security however things got exciting again, while presenting our boarding pass I heard the staff talk to each other and we were told there was something in our bag that caught their attention. All was said in an extremely friendly manner while we racked our brains trying to imagine what was in the suitcase. I was allowed down to the tarmac where I opened the suitcase and it was examined, it turned out to be a door stop I brought? The staff were friendly during all of this and let us into the plane with a smile. The flight itself was very nice the seats were more comfortable and spacious then our previous flights with Pegasus. All in all the staff was extremely friendly and professional.",0
2017,Doha to Kochi via Mumbai. I was having least expectation for this early morning flight. But crew on board offered genuine hospitality and big smile. They seems to be attentive and happy to operate this flight. And seating in the forward cabin crew working in the forward cabin did a good job on this flight. I would recommend indigo and would definitely fly with them again.,0
2017,"Bagdogra to Delhi. Check-in slightly chaotic at IXB. Flight full to the last seat. Service on board consisted of one cup of water. Seats narrow with not much legroom, which guaranteed very close contact to the neighbors. Arrival in DEL on time but we had to wait for some 40 min for the checked baggage to appear. We had flown the same route with Jet Airways before, who provided a much better experience than IndiGo.",1
2017,"We were traveling back from Hyderabad to Bangalore with our 85 year old mother and young children. The flight was delayed by 90 minutes in total and instead of arriving at 10.30pm we arrived at 12.05am. We had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate, we were advised to go back and sit. As the passengers were coming through the passage we couldn't make our way back to the seats. The air hostesses were extremely rude, repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats. They were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone. They asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious. In summary an extremely annoying experience, air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude, intolerant and unwilling to listen.",1
2017,"The service has been consistently good. Easily the best airline for domestic travel within India. In my experience they have been on time every single time (6 - 7 times a year that I flew). Extra legroom seats are charged nominally, no business class. Decent choice of snacks and beverages (no alcohol), crew are very professional and friendly. The aircraft could do with some inflight entertainment though. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone visiting India or flying out.",0
2017,"Bangalore to Mumbai. Indigo's late night flights are always late. This is my third experience with same flight - flight is delayed by 1hr 10mins, last time when I travelled a month before then it was delayed by 2 hours this is really horrible. Generally this flight is taken by one who attends office whole day and then come for flight and you face this issue again and again. Indigo will lose it's reputation if they continue to do so.",1
2017,Indigo always amazes me with their service. The environment in the aircraft from Chennai to Mumbai is very well maintained and the crew takes care of the passengers so very well. It is definitely the best airline in India. I would always be happy to fly with Indigo Airlines.,0
2017,"New Delhi to Muscat via Mumbai was an horrific experience.  I booked Delhi-Muscat ticket on Indigo website. They had a flight via Mumbai where flight was to be changed. The ticket was under single PNR, I confirmed with customer care if the luggage will be through checked in & he confirmed it would be done. But at the time of check in, the officer denied & started asking me the name of person who confirmed. Now, who remembers the name of customer care executive! So, I had to take the luggage in Mumbai & check-in again. With no other option, I did take the luggage. The gap between the 2 flight was of about 3 hours. I was supposed to be transferred to International airport. When I asked the ground staff to arrange transfer, they were clueless & asked me to go out, hire a taxi & leave. I got upset, but instead of helping me, the Mumbai ground staff kept on arguing. The taxi took a good time to reach International airport, as it was peak hour. Finally we could make it just in time only to find that the flight was delayed. This is the first time I have seen that international flight booked under one PNR from an airline website. No through check-in, No transfers,when both the flights are from same airline. Basic flight, No service, No entertainment, expensive Food.",1
2017,"Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata. As  faultless flight except for a long-standing problem: no Arrival Cards onboard the flight for foreign nationals thus delaying, on arrival in Calcutta the immigration process. Repeated requests over these past many years have yielded no positive result.",0
2017,The flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad was delayed by 2.30 hours in the night. Scheduled departure was at 10.40 pm and actual departure is 12.50 pm. This was my second worst experience within a fortnight period with IndiGo. They just give the reason of technical glitch and no alternate arrangements are there.,1
2017,"Kolkata to Hyderabad. It is the best domestic airline in India with best prices and the most punctual one. It is seldom late so I have never been in problem due to late arrivals as I mostly travel in late night flights. Food is basically paid one but I have never tried anytime. They consist of mainly ready to eat meals like cup-noodles, biriyani, sandwiches.",0
2017,"Delhi to Varanasi. This was my first flight with IndiGo and I was accompanied with my sister and her three children (2 kids and 1 infant). At Check-In we were given priority due to family. I was informed that they won't be able to accommodate us in one row as the seats were full. On my request, the Lady at the counter talked to her Supervisor and allotted us seats in the first row (which are paid seats) without any extra fee. That was really surprising and too generous of them. The boarding was smooth, the aircraft was clean and the food (paid) was good. It was a comfortable flight with very attentive and hospitable cabin crew. Even the ground staff was very helpful and courteous. The flight was on time and luggage reclaim was almost smooth. IndiGo definitely lived up-to it's tagline of on-time budget airline. Would definitely love to fly it again.",0
2017,"Flew IndiGo from Bhubaneswar to Chennai. Travel was good, the flight crew were good too. The flight was on time. However there a strange high pitched sound just before take off which lasted for 5-10 minutes and the AC stopped working until the flight took off. The sound was again heard during landing too. The baggage at conveyer belt after the flight landed was messed up. On the same belt there was back to back baggage for 3 flights which was cumbersome and troublesome. I had to stand at the belt for an hour waiting to receive my luggage, it was very crowded with people looking for bags. Ground service was poor.",1
2017,"Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.",1
2017,"Flew IndiGo from Jaipur to Kolkata. Take off and landing was smooth. Departure and arrival was on time. Seats were comfortable. Check-in was done smoothly. While boarding the aircraft the cabin crew welcomed us but not with their smiling faces. When I saw the air hostess serving water I asked for a glass of water, she didn't give me one but instead carried on serving water to other passengers even though I had asked before anyone else. On asking again twice, she replied twice ""I'll come back"". After that, I was given glass of water.",1
2017,Bengaluru to Mumbai by IndiGo Airlines. The check-in was quite comfortable. We were welcomed warmly by the cabin crew while boarding the aircraft. The aircraft seemed clean as compared to other airlines in India. The lavatories were also well maintained without any faul smell. The seats had a very soft cushioning hence it made quite a comfortable journey for us and were also wide. Though we had to buy food but it did not create any issues. Their food tasted fantastic. The flight departed and arrived on time. The landing and takeoff were very smooth. I recommend this airline and always a pleasure.,0
2017,"Flew from Mumbai to Bhubaneswar with IndiGo. It was the first time I was traveling in an A320neo aircraft so was quite excited about it. At the airport check-in was done smoothly without standing in any queue. While boarding the aircraft the cabin crew welcomed us with their smiling faces. The aircraft cabin seemed neat and clean. The lavatories were clean. The seats were quite comfortable and wide. The legroom was quite good. The food menu consisted of sandwiches, instant biryanis as well as instant noodles. I decided to go for sandwiches. They tasted good. The flight departed on time but arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled time of arrival. Really it was a pleasure traveling with them.",0
2017,"Indore to Delhi. Staff at airport are pretty rude, I had 1 check-in luggage and no hand luggage. My check-in luggage weight was 16.7kg. That lady was asking me to pay and when I said that I am not carrying any hand luggage still they said you can take out stuff and carry on hand luggage. I have been traveling with IndiGo for 7 years, they are getting worse and not value for money.",1
2017,"Rachi to Vadodara via Delhi. One day prior to my flight IndiGo changed my flight time, and worst part they divided our family of four into 3 and 1. Three of us has one flight and time and single member has another flight with a different time for the same destination on the same day. And when I was travelling many seats were vacant, why they didn't know.",1
2017,IndiGo is my preferred airline on the Dubai to Mumbai route - especially when not carrying checked in baggage. Good on-time airline and good flight timings. Courteous and mostly well trained staff - no inflight entertainment. Food and drinks paid as it's a budget airline.,0
2017,Hyderabad to Chennai. I had the worst experience flying with IndiGo airlines. The flight was delayed by 2 hours and adding to that handling of baggage was horrible. Baggage of 6 flights was released on a single belt at the same time. It took almost 1 hour to find the baggage and to find the baggage I had to make my way through 1000s of passengers waiting for their baggage. When contacted customer service they didn't have the contact info of IndiGo go personal in the airport.,1
2019,"Sydney to Auckland. I booked a ticket once and will never do that again. My flight was cancelled and they could not offer me an alternative flight to my destination. They have a hotel booking service. However, they refused to issue me a refund that I can use to book for hotels. I am not Australian and I don't live in Australia so there is zero use for me to use their voucher for Australian tickets. I wasted 850 dollars from my money and they refused to let me use it for hotel booking and could not offer flights for my requested destinations. Not even cooperative. Their reply was that the vouchers are automatically generated although I bought a refundable expensive ticket from them.",1
2019,"Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar Airways. Unhelpful and rude gate staff. Just an all round poor experience. On arrival to the gate there was a queue to get bags weighed and then a separate queue for boarding. When my bag was weighed I was a couple over. The man said I could put some heavy items of clothing on to see if this would reduce the weight. When I stepped to the side to try, a employee approached me and told me I have 2 minutes to try to reduce the weight or I might not get on the flight. This was a whole 45 minutes before the flight was due to take off. She was rude and obnoxious. Avoid at all cost.",1
2019,"This is the first time I flew with Jetstar and I will never dare to try it again, even if I have to pay double. I knew this was a budget airline, so I never had any high expectations on it. However, Jetstar is literally the worst budget airline. They have you retrieve your baggage between connection flights and have a super expensive fee for checked baggage! We had a domestic flight from Sapporo to Tokyo and followed by an international flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong with Jetstar. The staff at Sapporo check in counter did not speak a word of English, so when she struggled to tell us that we had to get our luggage and re-check in through their international flight counter in Tokyo, we thought we heard her wrong. Also, they charged us 10,000 yen for 2 luggage bags and measured the dimension of the only carry-on we had.  The domestic flight was late by 30 minutes. Our layover time in Tokyo was supposed to be 1hr 50min. So by the time we got to Tokyo and got our bags, it was already less than an hour before the flight takeoff to Hong Kong. We had to run all the way to their counter and check in our bags again and ran to the gate, just to later on find out the flight to Hong Kong was also delayed. The boarding is always a disaster for them. They have all the passengers lineup for boarding at once and could take almost an hour to finish boarding, no wonder their flight is always late. Staffs were unresponsive and rude.  Due to their delayed flights, we could not have a chance to eat before we got on board, so we wanted to order food off the menu. I tried to call the attendants 3 times that we wanted to order, they kept telling me to wait. My husband said they may only take order with their food trolley which they moved from front to the end cabin. OK! That doesnt make any sense but alright I will follow their rules and wait, unfortunately we sat at the end of the cabin. So we waited for another hour and the food trolley finally passed by and passed right through us, without stopping and back behind the curtain!! I was like, didnt I tell them again and again I wanted to order? How could they just ignore us like that? We called one of the attendants back and she goes, I am sorry, all our food is sold out. Could anyone tell me what did I miss there? If you want cheap flight, I can tell you this airline isnt exactly cheap with their high checked baggage cost and extra carry-on cost. The inexperienced and helpless staffs could also cost your vacation mood. I often travel to Japan and Japanese are always well-known of their efficiency and hospitality. I had never experienced anything like that with any Japanese company before, it was a very unfortunate experience.",1
2019,"Christchurch to Auckland. Will never use this airline again. Very rude and unhelpful check in staff, refused to help or offer any assistance with a name change on the ticket, staff cancelled the ticket immediately without any consideration (we paid 3x the standard amount due to the time of year). Called the contact centre in Philippines who had no procedures in place to accomodate a ticket update (we were 2 hours early so had ample time) - Also had no contact people in any airport to refer me to and could barely understand the issue we were facing. Re-booked flight with Air New Zealand.",1
2019,"Cairns to Osaka. They didnt provide the service we paid for saying it was unavailable due to overbooking, even though we have pre-booked and paid extra. They didnt offer a refund and still will not give us one. They then cancelled our return flight and still have not provided our refund for the accommodation we had to pay out of our own pocket. They argued our receipts were in a foreign language so they couldnt verify if they were legitimate, even though we were stuck in a foreign country because they cancelled the flight. I will never fly Jetstar again. 2 months later we are still out of pocket hundreds of dollars",1
2019,"I took two flights, from Melbourne to Darwin and then onto Singapore. Going onto the first flight the attendant stood and weighed passengers bags on boarding and snarled at those over or unfortunate enough to carry two bags (regardless of size) to enter the Extra cost line.  I was gutted I had no alternative to board the flight because of my existing plans. The staff were rude to me on both flights, they stood talking about customers in direct ear shot of the rest of us. I was looked at with disgust because I asked for a glass of water when they were offering paid for cups of tea, my water never arrived so I went thirsty.",1
2019,"Sydney to Phuket. Don't gamble with their ""Starter Fare"" I needed to cancel a 'Starter Fare' Jetstar ticket to Thailand - all options (name change, date change, destination change) were prohibitively expensive. The options were more expensive than buying a new ticket. Their call centre and chat centre are in the Phillipines and are bound to a rigid script. Even their 'Compassionate Grounds' chat line was a heartless dead end. They took all my money for no service.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Sydney. As advertised each person allowed to carry 7 kg of luggage. However at the gates, rude and unprofessional gate keeper pick 3 of us and send us back to pay extra luggage. They have another guy at the back to process the payment of extra luggage. This guy just make random decision to charge 2 of us $195 for extra luggage fee. Each of us carry 12kg of luggage which we explain that it is our kids luggage as it is impossible to get the kids to carry even 5kg of item themselves. They don't bother to listen to us and force us to pay the fee saying that if we argue, they'll leave us and we won't able to fly. The guy blamed me for not processing the luggage as a group which is incorrect. He also said that he only work here and if other staff sent us back to him, his job is to charge us. I explained that we come in a group and the guy who sent us back processed us together. He told me to submit complaint to customer service (which I already suspect will only waste my time). We can confirm that all of us are not exceeding the baggage allowance and it even fall below it. For a record, we also come early before the gate even opened. I tried to talk to the guy but he just play dumb and told us to go away. So I tried to complaint and explain to customer service online. And as expected, I chat with a human robot who only able to follow protocol which clearly designed to care, listen and treat customer fairly.  In the end of the day only monkey take peanuts and you get what you pay. However in this case the monkey is not only give you bad customer service but also rob you. To me, its not about the $ but I hate this kind of dodgy treatment.",1
2019,"Brisbane to Cairns. 1 out of 10 experience with this airline. We had a first flight from Brisbane to Cairns delayed 7 hours! (We cancelled and booked another one with virgin) then now from Cairns to Sydney which has been delayed for 2,5 hours with initial delay from 9:10 to 10:10 then 11:10 then 11:30. It is 11:30 and we are still sitting here with the boarding sign disappeared. ! Cant you just say a fixed time instead of fooling with us?",1
2019,Cairns to Osaka. I had booked a low cost flight to Osaka but was informed of a covering list I was due to operate on during the booking. I immediately attempted to cancel the booking and was told I would not be able to rebook the flight. On pressing ok I was informed that the full sum of my booking would be forfeited. Now this was 2 hours after the booking was made. No amount of calling or using the useless electronic chat allowed me to engage a responsible manager. I suggest that anyone thinking of flying Jetstar not bother buying tickets with them and use a different airline.,1
2019,I am a regular traveler that will never use Jetstar again. So they cancelled my flight from Hobart to Melbourne on the 1/12/19. Provided accommodation but would not pay for transportation to and from there accommodation which was a cost of over $120 I was told I could make a claim through Jetstar. The earliest flight the next day they offered was a late afternoon flight which didnt suit my requirements I booked an early morning flight with Tigerair to get home. So I dont use there return flight giving them an extra 2 seats on there plane I pay for my return trip out of my own pocket so because I never took their flight that didnt suit my requirements Im ineligible to get a refund in my taxi fares. Jetstar will do anything to get out of reimbursements of any kind Jetstar are corporate thieves and I will never use their service again. Unhappy regular traveler.,1
2019,"Gold Coast to Sydney. The last 4 flights I have booked with Jetstar have been cancelled. The staff on the ground are never to blame - they are rushing around working hard to try and make up for the fact that Jetstars systems are awful, they are understaffed, their facilities and resources are run down, and there is a general lack of organisation across the board with their flights. It honestly seems like they intentionally cancel flights so they can squeeze more people into empty flights, hence saving money. They wait until the last minute to tell you so they can be sure the threshold number of seats that would make the flight profitable is not achieved. When you book a flight with this airline you are buying a seat but never actually buying the flight time you think you are. Cancellations and delays will occur, and you will be shuffled around repeatedly by overworked and stressed staff. If they advertised themselves as youll get a seat to your destination when it suits us and is profitable for us and this may mean repeated delays and cancellations then the consumer would know what they are actually buying. They are not an option for convenience, reliability, good customer service or transparency.",1
2019,"Jetstar flights got cancelled between Melbourne and Sydney on Sunday, 22 Dec. Jetstar sent out emails lying to customers that the problem lies with late incoming aircraft. However, the ground staff confirmed that early morning flights were cancelled. Our boarding time was 8.20am and now it is 10.50am. This has happened on multiple occasions. This will most definitely be the last time we make use of Jetstars disgusting customer service! Hello Virgin!",1
2019,"Sydney to Auckland. Bad timing, bad service. Delayed for 4 hours without informing me. It was meant to take off at 6.10pm but instead of it took off at about 10pm and will get Auckland at 3am the next morning. My mum has to pick me up in the early morning thats ridiculous.  Never want to travel with Jetstar again.",1
2019,"Sydney to Ballina/ Simply appalling. Check-in staff were rude, cruel, had no patience or smile. No please or thank you. Disgraceful. Fanatical about overweight baggage to the 100 gram. Tried to suck every penny out. Abysmal.",1
2019,Gold Coast to Sydney. The worst trip I have ever taken. Plane sat on the runway for 2 hours. Customer service was limited and rude. No water offered or anything. This is why you are better off flying a better airline as it will cost less in the long run.,1
2019,Traveling from Melbourne to Bali. Receive a text at 11:00pm that the flight is canceled. Shocking. Gave an alternative flight which was longer via Sydney. Totally no consideration of your clients. Very unfortunate company. Quite surprised that it is still open. In queue with 200 people as online check in closed and to top it all they do not have machines for checkin either like all other airlines.,1
2019,"Singapore to Darwin. 5 hours before departure I was informed by SMS that the departure will be postponed by 8 hours from 11:00 pm to 07:00 am. I was able to leave my luggage in the evening and the airline took care of a good 4 star hotel with transportation and dinner. The staff was friendly and helpful. The aircraft made an average, maintained impression. There was water and small bites during the flight.",0
2019,The baggage checked-in was a big mess and everything went in chaos. We waited for around 1 h in the line and they did not even apologize. They lost my luggage and I have to wait to see if they can locate it. In case they wouldn't be able to find my luggage they will not pay me anything unless I provide them receipts. How can I find all the receipts.,1
2019,Sydney to Sunshine Coast. We got in the airport two hours earlier. There was a very crowed long queue with 6 long lines. We waited in the line and walked slowly in front. They mixed all the flights of jetstar together. They announced passengers of other flights two times to go out of queue and stand in separated lines. This way the queue discipline was destroyed and a lot of people jump from end of queue to in front. We waited and waited and there were 3 ladies in counter. As we arrived to one line before last. Two of the ladies left and only one was there to receive the luggage. We waited two long and then ran to catch the flight. Every passenger of jetstar had stress of losing her flight. I have never experience such an unorganized airline in my life.,1
2019,"Sydney to Ballina. Plane booked 2 months ago, and yesterday we were told that the flight will be canceled. 2 hours on the phone just to be told, we have no solution, we give you the money back and that's it. We had to leave Sydney to go to Byron bay, no solution other than to get there by bus, or by driving. The company are very incorrect and  not professional at all, Never want to be with this company again.",1
2019,"Christchurch to Auckland. Worst flight experience ever. Both of today's flights were cancelled and I was told I couldn't re-book for 2 days which would have forfeited $1,000's of dollars in plans. To make matters they only offered to refund the price of the ticket without any compensation for the impact on my plans. Instead of cancelling my plans and booking a hotel for 2 nights, I was forced to pay another airline $400 to continue my trip. All of the ticket agents were terrible to deal with indicating they didn't actually work for Jetstar and I'd have to call them for further assistance. After holding for 30 minutes, I hung up and will have to try and resolve after I return from holiday.",1
2019,"Was suppose to fly out on a flight from Sydney to Melbourne on Friday  6th December at 8:30pm as it got delayed 3 times due to the smoke coming from the New south Wales bush fires before it was announced cancelled at 11pm. At this stage, I was frustrated an I had called the Jetstar contact center and had explained the situation on which they had re booked me for a flight to Melbourne the next morning with Virgin which I thought was good service. I also had been told that I would be reimbursed for a hotel up to $150 dollars per night from the lady I was on the phone as I and didn't want to take a cab or ride share that would easily cost me over $100 to get back home to go back to my area which is 35kms away from the Airport. I decided to sleep at a hotel nearby which costed me $180 on which I thought I would get reimbursed with $30 for food reimbursements as well but I ended up with nothing as I had to live in a area 50 km away from the airport. If I was told by anyone by Jetstar this whole situation of me forking out more money would of been avoided. Jetstar really needs to improve their communication as it is really just poor and wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with them.",1
2019,"Scheduled on flight from Singapore to Bali 8/12/19 at 5.20am. The flight was cancelled at 7pm (10 hours before departure time). We had already done online check in by then and did not realise the flight was cancelled till 2am. The next available flight proposed was 24 hours away on 9/12/19. As we had already made travel plans and tours in Bali, we decided to cancel the booking and were refunded the cost of the flight. However, there was no additional compensation by Jetstar or apology. The new flight booked was three times the cost of the original flight as this was a last minute booking. This is the second time Jetstar has suddenly cancelled a flight. My first experience was from Hobart to Singapore. Will not travel with Jetstar again.",1
2019,Sydney to Phuket. We paid for the max package We had to change our dates of flight and when booking is part of the max package at no charge. When we change them they charged an extra $400 approximately because apparently fares had gone up but were actually cheaper on their web site. Only extra leg room is the front row. Waste of time. Received meal 1 hour into 9 hour flight. Always trying to up sell you products. Personally Id never use them again totally disappointing way to start your holiday,1
2019,"Singapore to Denpasar. This was the worse experience I had. I booked my ticket and Jetstar sent me a confirmation email like usual, they charged my credit card right away, also like usual. On the day of the flight I came to do check in and they had cancelled my flight 2 days earlier and didnt even bother to send me an email. Not to mention the money wasnt refunded to my credit card. They told me it was cancelled and they process a refund and if I wanted to fly I needed to buy a new ticket.",1
2019,"Gold Coast to Sydney. My flight into Sydney was fairly uneventful with friendly flight staff but on arrival the back of the flight was disembarked via the metal steps onto the tarmac then up 2 flights of steps to exit. I a mother traveling alone with my 1.5 year old and was my self struggling to carry her and my bags on that route but to my dismay i had to watch a elderly couple absolutely struggle to decent the stairs and then ascend the stairs, this occurred in full view of a male staff member watching on. When  I reached the top I alerted a female flight attendant who went to see if someone could help but the struggle had already occurred. I though it was terribly lacking in compassion and frankly dangerous. On my return flight apart from a delay the flight was fine, when i went to pick up my baggage and pram i found it and many bags piled up on the floor and stuck in the re entry point of the baggage claim carousel and was continuing to stack up and bags falling, no staff were there helping or stopping the situation, when i pulled my pram from the wreck its wheel was broken off and is now not usable.",1
2019,Adelaide to Sydney. I've been travelling for years and especially with Jetstar but no more the staff were rude and do nothing to help elderly people. They changed gates 5 minutes to board. I had to push my mum in a wheelchair and was hard as I'm dealing with a hernia. To top it off they cancelled our flight and saying it was an act of God and but at gate 25 they gave our plane away. Jetstar said cancelling our flight was an act of God on Monday night but after speaking to friends in Sydney it wasn't that bad ... Qantas took off 20 minutes before our flight.  All in all Jetstar are definitely not the airline you want to travel with.,1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. If there is an award for worse airline in the world, Jetstar has got to top the list. Ive never never taken any flights that cancels me flight 3 straight weeks in a row, and its a last minute cancel, 30 mins before departure. Yesterdays cancellation (6th dec 2019) is the last straw. We were all embarked on the plane, 5 minutes later we were asked to disembark and flight was cancelled. Jetstar is the most unreliable airline Ive taken.  For example yesterdays flight cancellation reason was due to Sydney airport curfew, but its because they delayed their own schedule that went into airport curfew time which is unacceptable! On top of that, no compensation arrangements at all! No accountability! And  lousy customer service. Look at the line to the support counter in the picture I attached.",1
2019,"Newcastle to Melbourne. Booked a return flight for my wife and my self to visit our son and family in Melbourne. Our flight was due to depart at 6.10am. We were informed at 8.30pm the night before that the flight had been cancelled due to operational problems, whatever that means. Tried to rebook on any flight that day but was informed all seats had been booked. The only flight available was the next day at the same time. One day lost as we were not allowed to rebook our return flight a day later. Friends laughed when I told them we had booked with Jetstar as this appears to be a regular occurrence with this airline. Jetstar may be cheap but I doubt if we will fly with them, again. I pity the ladies working in the chat centre as they must get some very abusive calls regarding the operation of this airline.",1
2019,"Queenstown to Sydney. My flight was delayed 3.5 hours but that was not the issue. Its the fact that they then lost the baggage of 15 people and did not tell anyone. Once I arrived in Sydney I waited for my bag in baggage claim for about 30 minutes until I went over to a desk to ask about it. Apparently many bags did not make the flight. This does not make much sense because they had my bag more than 4 hours before take-off and there was only 1 other international flight at that time. They also did not inform anyone else via email or anything until we went to ask about it. They promise 24 hour delivery of lost baggage but that is completely false. They also said they would send me an email with all of the information which was also false. And finally, they provided a baggage tracking site that does not work at all. I had to call them to get my reference number so that I could check, but when I enter my information, surprisingly the site that looks like it's from 2002 does not work.",1
2019,"Sunshine Coast to Sydney. The worst customer experience ever experienced. Cancelled flights with no option for 24hr rebook. Staff also asked to scan boarding pass from phone, didnt return it and when we were looking through the airport for the phone played dumb.",1
2019,"Flew Newcastle to Brisbane Friday 29th November 2019, delayed 40 mins. On return trip Sunday night flight delayed then cancelled. Rescheduled Monday morning 6am then delayed. Poor service. Staff honestly do not seem to care. The CEO should fly Jetstar to get a taste why Jetstar is so poorly regarded.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Christchurch with Jetstar Airways. Our flight was cancelled two hours before it was suppose to take off due to crew requirements. All our plans had be changed because of this. It was good enough that Jetstar agreed to refund us our return ticket. The chaos and stress didnt stop just there. When we arrived at the Jetstar Check-in in the counter, we were told we had to apply for a tourist visa. This new rule was only implemented in October 2019. This rule applies even if you have a PR in Australia! We were so anxious about it because our flight was scheduled to depart in 1 hour. I would have rated Jetstar a 2/10 but Im thankful for a staff member at the check-in counter for helping my partner and I. She was really understanding and helpful with our situation. She managed to expedite our process. Lets just hope there are no more stressful surprises ahead.",0
2019,"Adelaide to Brisbane. I understand low cost airlines have to charge for things others provide for free but Jetstar cross the line into ripoff. My company purchased extra baggage and I fly weekly around Australia with one Cabin bag and one laptop bag. However as I didnt check the cabin bag Jetstar charged $65 for the cabin bag. I did explain that the bag goes on the same plane and that it was less work for them if I carry, but the opportunity for a fee was apparently too good to miss!",1
2019,"As a first time flyer on Jetstar to Phuket I was pleasantly surprised. Flights out of Sydney always seem to leave late no matter which airline I have flown and this flight's departure was no exception.  The crew were very good as was the quality of the food, headphones and online movies. The bathrooms were clean. The outbound flight received a few complaints about running out of cheesecake for dessert but that was not the crew's fault. I flew business class which is not the same as business class on other airlines but comparable. The under leg supports only came up to mid calf which was very uncomfortable. The inbound flight check in crew and arrangements for check in at Phuket airport, did puzzle me. All business class and economy class passengers were in the same queue which is not normal. As Jetstar is a subsidiary of Qantas I expected fairly fluent English to be spoken at the airport. They were polite but understanding of English was far from good. All people checking in were from Europe or Russian and they all communicated in English. They looked at my passport and asked me if it was ""New"" when it clearly showed in it that it had been issued in 2013. It did not show up on their system which was strange as it did when I had arrived two weeks earlier. One very helpful staff member called the Australian Embassy for clearance. The only error made was the announcement by one of the cockpit crew when we were descending in to Sydney. He was English speaking but announced that we were ""Ascending"" which I found quite amusing.",0
2019,"Sydney to Adelaide. I was asked to weigh both my carry on in addition to my laptop. 1.5kg over the limit, I was forced to pay $65. What choice did i have. Then they tagged my bags with ""overweight"" tags which isn't true, individually they were under weight.  I won't be flying with them again. Not only did they charge $65 for me to get on the flight, but they delayed the flight by half an hour while they sorted out technical trouble concerning luggage.",1
2019,"Brisbane to Melbourne. Never before have I been asked to weigh my carry on at the gate. Never before have I been told that my handbag weight counts towards my carry on luggage bag weight. I understand that I was over the permitted weight of 7kg when both items were weighed together, but I was disgusted by the fact this has never been required before and I had to pay a $65 fee to board my flight. I chose Jetstar because it is a safe, reliable and economical option. When you whack on a $65 fee, this makes Jetstar just as expensive as competitors. I will seriously consider flying with Qantas or Virgin next time as I know I won't be hit with unexpected fees. These carriers are more expensive because they offer food and in-flight entertainment. Jetstar does not. I opted for the more affordable carrier to keep costs down. Imagine my surprise at the gate when I had to cough up another $65! All I had in my carry on was a laptop, an outfit for work, pjs and a pair of stilettos. It's laughable that I can ""wear"" everything on, but I'm charged if I'm ""carrying"" it. What a joke!",1
2019,"Every time we fly with Jetstar, it is almost expected that flights will be delayed. On our most recent trip to Japan, both inbound and outbound were delayed. We stopped at Cairns for a connecting flight and the staff pulled us in to reweigh our bags when we had already weighed them with no issues leaving Japan and even after checking in at the Cairns check-in counter. They made me open my bags in front of everyone, I had to pull out some clothes to wear. They then noticed my partner was with me and made her weigh her bags too. In the end, they made us pay $65 each. The ironic thing is that we flew from Japan with no dramas, same airline. Our bags already had the carry on tags which even the Jetstar staff let people through when they saw these tags on peoples carry ons as they walked in. I guess we were just unfortunate as we were singled out and made an example of. Safe to say this will be the last time we will fly with this atrocious airline. We rather pay that little extra to fly with a flagship airline, at least they provide in-flight meals, fly direct, and you don't have to buy your luggage, which is probably how Jetstar lures people in with their so called ""cheap fares"". I'll be sure to let all my friends and family know not to fly with these money hungry, poor serviced airline. Definitely not worth flying with.",1
2019,"One of the worst customer service experience I ever had. Bag drop assistant was too slow on serving as a result they came up with a reason for being delay on dropping my bag, I had to wait on the queue for more than 15 mins. Moreover they were saying flight delayed and whilst I approached the counter lady told me its 4 mins late on baggage drop and made me pay $130 extra for missing the baggage drop. Whoever dealt with my issue were all rude to me. This is the last time I am going to take this airlines.",1
2019,"Sydney to Brisbane. They cancelled and rescheduled and cancelled again, repeatedly, in both directions of flight. I had originally booked 2 x 90 minute flights but Jetstar cancelled and delayed those two flights for over 3 days. I went between hotels and airports for 3 whole days! Finally I did get to my destination 36 hours late, but finally gave up on waiting for my return flight after another 26 hour wait, and asked for a refund and they agreed. I booked with another airline and left within hours. (Jetstar's reason had been weather, but all other airlines were still flying) When I left the airport, via a different carrier and applied for a refund online afterwards, Jetstar then refused to refund me for a flight they had already verbally told be was refundable, and which they had cancelled! Avoid Jetstar if you want any security or are hoping to get either a flight or your money back. Jetstar provides neither flights nor refunds.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Hamilton Island via Sydney. Worst airline Ive ever traveled on. Been on so many budget airlines before and this is by far the worst, have queues hundreds of metres long with little staff (less than 4) to check everyone in and most staff are rude. Quite literally never been on a flight with them with no hassles.",1
2019,Melbourne to Sydney. No longer a cheap airline. Bad customer service and rip-off when it comes to cabin baggage. $65 dollars for 2 kilograms over in cabin baggage is wrong wrong wrong. Better to fly Virgin or Qantas.,1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. For a flight time of 1 and half-hours, the flight already delayed by 2 and half hours without any formal notification provided. No complimentary service offered. Worst flight taken to date. Never choose Jetstar ever again.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Christchurch. The cancellation of a Jetstar flight resulted in the cancellation of all family trips which we planned half a year ago. The notice was sent to us just 5 hours before the airport check-in. The closest flight that Jetstar offered is 4 days later. That, of course, wouldn't fit my schedule as all the hotel I booked are full. The reason for cancellation given by Jetstar is crewing requirement. When I ask Jetstar staff what does that mean she said she doesnt actually know what that means. There is no compensation plan and passengers had to pay all cancellation fees for precooked hotels and activities.",1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Extremely poor customer service. 120$ surcharge for 1kg over. Harassed to weigh our luggage more than 5 times, watched over when tossing things out, rude flight attendant.",1
2019,Cairns to Sydney via Melbourne. I am so disappointed with my experiences with Jetstar thus far. My first flight being cancelled after already checking in luggage. Having to stay an extra night in cairns delaying plans and bookings for that night and the next day. We were given false information at the counter and different info at the hotel we were put into about a food allowance given. The queues were extremely long and slow in cairns on Saturday morning further stressing my experience.. we then had a flight this morning from Sydney where the staff were extremely rude laughing about our situation on this flight and commenting about it while we waited to board our flight. Saying' it happens to the best of us' Also getting off the flight we had an airhostess repeatedly raising her voice shouting at us and other customers to get off the flight through the front door. I am so upset and disappointed. My experience has been terrible. I feel there was no remorse no help and there also doesnt seem to be much assistance where needed. My review gives minus stars. Not the experience i was promised.,1
2019,"Gold Coast to Sydney, Jetstar pulled us aside and weighed our carry including my Partners hand bag and charges us $120 for being 1Kg over. Handbag was weighed on top of our allowed 7kg. Boycot Jetstar, they are the worst airline. No voucher or anything will get us back.  This is not the first time we are disappointed. No more Jetstar even if its for free.",1
2019,"Singapore to Adelaide via Denpasar. I was very disappointed with total lack of service on these flights. There was no complimentary food or drink, no pillow or blanket, no entertainment, no WiFi and no leg room. We have travelled on many ""budget"" airlines and they offer a full service. These Jetstar flights were not that cheap in comparison. Adding to this they were the only flights from our trip which included 1p flights that were delayed.",1
2019,Auckland to Christchurch. Baggage check in was closed early on a flight that was delayed. Was standing in line for 20 mins watching 5 staff behind the counter mess around doing nothing then telling me I was too late to check in when I finally was able to talk to someone. They claimed I was late to check in and that I should have been earlier however I wasnt the only one in the queue with this issue. About 3 others were also waiting to check in their baggage to the same flight but staff were not serving people and when they finally did we were blamed as being late when we had been standing in the queue since well before check in was due to close. I was rather frustrated when getting to the counter to find out I would have to wait for another 2 hours on arrival at my destination as my bags couldnt make it and would be sent on the next flight. I said I was disappointed in the service and would reconsider flying with Jetstar in the future. A Jetstar staff member proceeded to snap back at me claiming she didnt care whether I flew with Jetstar again or not and that it was my fault I wasnt here early enough. I work in retail myself for a company that was recently awarded best retailer for customer service in Australia. Jetstar staff definitely have a thing or two to learn. The experience I had with Jetstar on this incident was appalling. I fly every month for business however I will no longer choose Jetstar and will encourage others not to either. I have experienced bad customer service from Jetstar in the past but never this bad. The way I was spoken to was disgusting and extremely rude. Never again.,1
2019,"Melbourne to Christchurch. This is the fourth time Im travelling with Jetstar, a round trip to Bali and another to Christchurch. Three flights had delays of 1 to 10 hours and the fourth which is the return to Melbourne from Christchurch got cancelled last minute and postponed to the day after and even then it got delayed for another hour. Very poor customer service. Will never book with them and recommend everyone else not to either, well its cheaper but isnt worth all delays and imagine getting cancelled as well and waiting at the airport for hours.",1
2019,"I fly frequently with Jetstar for both business and holidays. They are almost never on time and I have been put out on many occasions by their delays - one should always expect Jetstar to be running two hours late and then one is less likely to be disappointed. I had plans to fly to Sydney this weekend for a visit to the Blue Mountains. My accommodation and other plans were cancelled as the area is consumed by bushfires. The NSW government has declared a state of emergency and evacuated the entire area I planned to visit. Jetstar will not allow a refund nor credit for future flights, so I have essentially thrown away the cost of two roundtrip tickets I can no longer use. As a frequent Jetstar customer I am extremely disappointed and will not be flying with them again. Virgin and Qantas cost the same when you consider all of Jetstar's extra costs, like $60 for baggage over 7kg. And Virgin and Qantas make for a much better experience.",1
2019,"We were boarded onto a Jetstar flight from Adelaide to Melbourne. Just before departure, the pilot advised that we were required to change planes. We disembarked and went to another gate which had a plane at the gate which was unable to fly due to a fault. Jetstar then reloaded the first plane with customers travelling from Adelaide to Cairns. Extremely deceptive behaviour. Jetstar are  trying to say it was a safety reason but the first plane left for Cairns. Jetstar staff stated that the changed occurred so the Cairns flight could return to Adelaide before the curfew.",1
2019,"Gold Coast to Sydney. Stingy airline. You get what you pay for but worse in actual fact. Its worth paying more to avoid the scrutiny Jetstar have with their baggage restrictions, poor quality seating and mediocre staff. I got slogged $60 for baggage being 2kg over their limit with no change to go through my bags. Never again",1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Absolutely frustrated! Our flights were the most expensive part of our 3 day trip and was the most disappointing experience! First off our flight on Monday 7am was cancelled with no explanation we had to sit at the airport from 5:30am to 1pm, we didnt get to Melbourne until the afternoon (one day taken up sitting at a airport). then we get to the airport on Wednesday at 1:30 for our 4:30 flight home and 4:10pm the flight gets delayed again, expected departure 6:15 come around to 6pm and its delayed again. Didnt fly out until 7:30pm, no compensation given! Never again will we fly with Jetstar!",1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Extremely frustrated, worst airline ever. The flight was cancelled 4 minutes before the departure time due to weather in Melbourne while my friend just arrived in Melbourne 2 hours earlier and was shocked to hear weather issue in Melbourne when the weather there was pretty good. While I had to wait in the queue for an hour to see any flight options, I already saw online there was no more flight available that night. I already paid for the hotel in Melbourne and couldnt change. After confirming with the staff in check-in counter, I could only book the flight at 6 am the next morning and was also told I wouldnt get any compensation for hotel or train cost because it was weather issue, not Jetstars responsibility. I had to return home and left home at 4 am to the airport for the flight at 6 am. After I came back, I tried to complain and request for compensation for the hotel. I hadnt found an email address and could only submit my hotel receipt and train record via an online form and complained to a machine in a chat window who showed no human emotion and just said it was weather and there was nothing they could do. They dont have Toll free number and the phone number charges apply. They simply refused to take any responsibility or even listen with a human ear. I will never fly with Jetstar again.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Bali. Flight was delayed by over an hour for no specific reason. Apparently there were issues. Prior to my recent vacation, Ive also flown with Jetstar and every time it has been unpleasant. Id recommend just paying a little more and going with something more reliable, punctual and comfortable. Beyond frustrated",1
2019,"Denpasar to Melbourne. This will be the last time I fly with Jetstar outside Australia. We waited in a line for 2.5hrs with our 6 month old, poor communication, no water offered while waiting, overnight accomodation was tacky to say the least! $30 food voucher for the day, what a joke, see what you get for that on their flights a drink and a packet of chips! Jetstar if you not up to delivering a service, then pull out of the business. What a distasteful end to what was a beautiful holiday.",1
2019,Adelaide to Sydney . Non professional behaviour from Adelaide staff. Never fly in this airline again. The gate shows last call and they didn't allow me to fly. Strange strange arguments for that. I asked for compensation. Its not my fault that the gate didn't show closed.,1
2019,"My wife and I traveled from NZ to Gold Coast via Sydney. We had 1 luggage bag 15kg purchased and of course cabin luggage (including laptop etc). No problem on NZ-Sydney, but boarding flight in Sydney, we got called by Jestar staff to weigh our cabin bags. We had few kgs over. After some repacking, (putting jackets on) it was only 1kg over the limit. We explained that we had extra 1kg in luggage (our bag was 14kg) and that it was laptop and we traveled internationally to no avail. They took our boarding passes and rushed us to pay $60 fee. I said may be we can re-pack (I had few old magazines there and battery pack for mobile, which I could put in the pocket). But they said we will miss our flight. They basically, extorted money from us and other passengers quickly. I complained online , but their customer service repeat the same mantra, that it is correct. Overall, they ruined experinece over 1kg and aim was to charge money and fast , not to accommodate customers. Horrible Jetstar, rude and not understanding. We will avoid when possible.",1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. The second time I took Jetstar for interstate travel. Never taking their service again. Terrible behaviour by staff, rude and arrogant. I was asked to keep my phone away and after the first request, I was told that my phone will be confiscated. Never faced such troubles in any airline across the entire world.",1
2019,"Hobart to Melbourne. If you value your time more than money do not fly with Jetstar. Getting a flight on time is as common as spotting a unicorn. I had the displeasure to fly with them 4 times this year. My yearly record is delayed 2 hours, delayed 1hr, cancelled (no refund and not even a voucher) and today I am delayed 3 hours (for now!). I would highly recommend flying with other companies, at least as a push to improve their service. It is a pity that their parent airline Qantas does not push for improvements. I hope another budget airline decides to open shop in Australia, would be great to have some tougher competition to raise those terrible standards.",1
2019,Dunedin to AucklandApp does not work and it is so hard to navigate. Check in was a nightmare because I had to check in a box and that was apparently unusual but I have never had a problem regarding this with Other airlines. Cabin crew did not greet and one of them just had way too much attitude. Seat was not comfortable and flight was so delayed. They text us saying gates close at 4pm sharp but gates opened at 3:58. Absolutely ridiculous cannot plan anything in advance if youre flying this airlines. Will not be flying with them again.,1
2019,The most unreliable airline in Australia. I will never fly with this airline again. Flight to Sydney was delayed by two hours this morning due to a minor technical problem and flight back home was cancelled just as I got to airport. My whole day was thrown into chaos as a result and had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Virgin to ensure I made it back home for a very important engagement. For anyone considering flying with Jetstar?  Its worth paying a little extra with a more reliable airline such as Virgin or Qantas.,1
2019,Perth to Bali. Got all the way to the departure lounge today seeing there was a delay. Not long after told over the PA that the flight was cancelled and to make our way to luggage claim and then back to check in counter for options. Massive queue lining up for hours only to be told they could not do anything but advise us to ring their number.,1
2019,"Hobart to Sydney. Terrible airline, staff at the check in were great. Staff at boarding were horrible, unfriendly and issues with flight delays to and from. Charged 60 AUD for 3 KG of weight, price to pay ahead of check in was 30 AUD. Two + hour flight, no snack or drink. No in flight infotainment system, seats were very uncomfortable.",1
2019,Perth to Bali. Flight cancelled just before boarding due to a sick crew member. Surely they should have a pool of relief staff. Poor communication from ground staff and will never fly with them again. Our trip to Bali has just more than doubled in price as we needed to book last minute with an alternative airline in order to make it for a special Birthday celebration.,1
2019,Brisbane to Sydney. Wont fly with Jetstar again. Delayed by nearly an hour. We all stood waiting in line with no information for 40 minutes before they had the decency to make an announcement that the plane was running late. Charged me $60 because my bag was a smidge over 7kg. Poor airline. Very unhappy.,1
2019,"Brisbane to Hobart booked for November 2019. Needed to cancel my flights, I had to change them manually for another there and then with a $170 fee, I cannot just change dates, I have a family to take into consideration. Couldn't even book flights for my family at the same time, so we can't sit together. Supervisor wouldn't take the time to talk to me, and the staff member I was talking to said there was no complaint team I could speak to, then they left me on hold for hours until I just couldn't take it anymore and hung up. Lost $500.",1
2019,"Saigon to Melbourne. We got no email for the delay and arrived at the airport for our 1030pm flight. At 945pm, they announced flight delayed to 0030 (2 hours delay) Around 11 pm, we received an email confirming plane delay til 1730pm next day (total of 19 hours delay). Told us to leave and pick up all our luggage and ask us to head to the hotel they provided. I saw they took the plane away. Waiting for the luggage in disappointment. Cancelled 2 of my meetings for work. Still waiting.",1
2019,"Booked Jetstar business class flight to Tokyo Narita. Noticed first leg was normal economy to Gold Coast airport. carry on luggage only 7 kgs. Rest of flight 14 kgs. No use to us, restricted to 7 kg carry on for entire flight to Japan. Asked if we were permitted 14 kg as we were flying business class the rest of the way, not permitted. Then we found that we were not permitted to enter any lounge, business class or other. We had nearly 4 hour wait in Gold Coast airport before take off. We were not permitted into Qantas lounge despite it being empty. 4 hours between flights going over; 5 hours delay coming back. A substantial part of the reason flying business class is access to a lounge for business and other purposes particularly if you are in your seventies. Our business class seat was jammed and would not recline, quality of food very poor.",1
2019,First there was a delay leaving Sydney on Friday then as we got into Melbourne there was another delay. So we had to circle for a good 30 minutes before we were finally allowed to land. Intentionally booked an earlier flight home on Monday 7th October for a family gathering on Labour. Got a text 2.5 hours before flying time to be told flight has been cancelled. No earlier flight home and earliest available is 6.45pm. Well done Jetstar thank you for screwing up my long weekend. I totally understand there are unexpected delay from time to time. But somehow you managed to make this a constant occurrence every time I choose you fly with Jetstar. Think this is where we part ways never again lesson learnt.,1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. If you have travel deadlines, don't fly with Jetstar: To start off with : our flights were cancelled. The service desk guy was shouting at others that he could not accommodate people to other flights and that Thursday flying people had to now wait till Saturday for next flight. And our flight back to Sydney was cancelled as well. Never flying Jetstar again.",1
2019,"Honolulu to Melbourne via Sydney. The very worst flying experience of my life. I read all the horrible reviews and thought, aw cmon, how bad can they really be? Well, here it is. Booked a non-stop flight from Honolulu to Melbourne scheduled to depart 8AM and arrive about 10-1/2 hours later on October 1st. Arrived at the airport and stood in the check-in line only to find out that the flight was cancelled. No advance notice whatsoever! We were sent away to a hotel shuttle after being assured that we should be rescheduled for the next day and would be notified later in the day in any event. After hearing nothing from Jetstar by early afternoon, we logged into their website to discover that we had been rebooked for 8:30AM on October 5th, connecting through Sydney with a 7-hour layover! So, instead of a direct 10:30 journey, we were now spending 3 nights waiting for a 19-hour journey and all without even the courtesy of a notification. To make matters worse, when my wife and I finally got on the plane, we discovered that we were not even seated together on this wonderful replacement flight and we had paid extra for our seats on the original flight. Plus, it gets even better. Jetstar does not transfer luggage between an international and domestic flight on the same ticket so we needed to collect our bags in Sydney and drag them around the airport with us for 5-hours because Jetstar will not accept bags until 2-hours before a flight. This also meant that we could not get through security to reach a decent restaurant for those 5-hours as well and needed to just hang out in the outer airport by the ticket counters. But this still was not the end of our ordeal. As a cherry on top, we were rewarded by the likes of a very nasty counter clerk who insisted that the very same bags that we had dragged over from international were now 2kg overweight each and demanded another $60! What happened? Did our bags pick up 4kg of grime off the airport floors as we dragged them around behind us for the past 5-hours? We elected to throw out a couple of books and my hiking boots rather than pay these jokers another dime! Oh, and the domestic flight to Melbourne ended up delayed by 20 minutes. Ok, to call this airline incompetent, apathetic and rude would actually be an insult to the other incompetent, apathetic and rude businesses out there in the world and thats all I have to say about that. If you ever have the notion to consider Jetstar for your travel needs, my advice is to Run Forest, Run!",1
2019,"Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. It was absolutely one the most unpleasant experiences Ive ever had with an airline. The seat was uncomfortable, the service was bad and the flight got delayed for 6 hours. I heard lots of complaints about Jetstar but still decided to choose it. Lesson learned, never again!",1
2019,"Melbourne to Sunshine Coast. Pathetic all round. Flight cancelled, dismal instruction, online portal poor, employees were totally useless. Constant incorrect or inaccurate notifications via text or email. Huge queues, promised alternative flights but then reneged on that, feel for the elderly and families with young children. Could be dealt with so much better, just be straight with people, stop shaving costs and treating people like cattle. Will never use the company again, ever.",1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Absolute disgrace. Flight cancelled 40 minutes before departure with no reasoning other than engineering issue. No replacement flight provided until 8:40 pm the following night. When finally spoke to someone, they refused to compensate any costs travelling to and from the airport, or the $400 loss of hotel accommodation in Melbourne. Will never fly with this airline again.",1
2019,Brisbane to Cairns. Flight was cancelled the morning of the flight. Only offer was a flight arriving after midnight - which with 2 young children and an elderly 74 yo isn't ideal. Wouldnt offer any form of assistance with lounge access or anything. I have had similar situations with other airlines but they at least assisted with something. The answer from Jetstar - your booking package gets you nothing basically. Just feeling let down as I know its about airline profit.,1
2019,Ballina to Melbourne. Disgraceful service. Poor communication with all its customers from a cancelled flight to appalling after sales service. No care given to its obligations towards decent and basic customer service. I have had more issues with this airline than I could write in this review. This airline is budget for a reason. And that is that the customer service experience is one of limited care. Bad communication and poor basic common sense and customer appreciation. This airline could change its perception within the industry if it focused more on the customer and not the bottom line in its business model. The fact that due to unforeseen circumstances that a flight can be canceled is one thing and sometimes very understandable for what ever reason. The after sales service of having to deal with providing alternative accommodation would also not be easy. But to take its stranded passengers two hours away to a partner accommodation rather than support more local townships with this business and not having a plan available that can handle this situation is just poor business management. This is not the first time this has happened and the fact that this is still happening with this airline after multiple similar experiences in the past 20 years clearly states that they have no interest or intention to offer a good or moderate customer satisfaction experience. Jetstar you are poor poor poor in your customer experience within the Australian airline industry.,1
2019,"Auckland to Dunedin. I was charged excess baggage fee of $630. I was connecting from an international flight and aware of Jetstars stricter baggage allowance and called the Jetstar customer case and the representative told me that I would be charged $15 for excess of each 5 kg. I was prepared to pay at the counter but they told me that once the baggage drop is open the rate increases to $15 for excess of each 1 kg. I ended up paying $630 instead of $126. I explained that I checked in before the bag drop opened and nobody including the phone representative (that I called many days earlier) did not tell me that I should have purchase it before the bag drop opened. But they insisted that I should pay $630, not $126. I ended up paying $630 but called the customer care several times after that but they told me to provide the phone record so I prepared it. But they just notified that they would not provide refund no matter what.",1
2019,Nightmare experience. Booked return tickets for family from Sydney to Auckland. They cancelled return flights day before midnight without reasons and asked to reschedule flights. Had to travel next day as all flights were booked. We had to rebook accomodation and wear meals and other expenses. They has asked us to submit claim for reimbursements with receipts which we did. Been chasing for refund for last 2 months - called them 100 times. Then suddenly they closed the file without notifying me and did not refund my claim. What kind of treatment is this Jetstar! I did not cancel my flight and request you to change my flight. You made me run like a fool for 2 months chasing for refund and you have closed my case without even bothered to inform me nor refund my expenses. If you are not keen to refund then please tell public straightaway. I will never ever travel on Jetstar or Qantas in my life.,1
2019,"Jetstar please check the accuracy of your scales! Flying from Cairns to Sydney with Jetstar. Really unhappy with the customer service at the check-in. I thought we might have some overweight hand luggage but hoped that checked in luggage can balance it out. What came out for my surprise our checked in luggage was over 30kg each. And early morning in the airport panicking, throwing our clothes and personal items to the bins because cheap airline company Jetstar does not allow more than 7kg each to flight, even when the next ones have other regulations as 10kg hand luggage. So in Sydney, we weighed our checked-in luggage again and those were both under 30, which would have given us some balancing room for the stuff we throw away and pay less for extra kilos. I strongly advise to check how much your luggage weighs before, or some other scales or just compare with different ones in the airport. Jetstar is clearly there for the money making. Even before boarding they walk around with their tiny scale to catch overweight luggage and this is just humiliating - how low can this cheap company go? Im pretty sure soon you are not allowed to bring any free carry on luggage and maybe you have to start paying for your seat in the plane as well. Never again with this company. Felt so ridiculously stupid there trying to figure out what things Ill throw away.",1
2019,"Sunshine Coast to Sydney. The whole trip was a rip off. The staff at the check in counter didnt check the weight of our carry on luggage or notify that our computers are counted within the 7kg carry on weight. At the boarding gate, the staff selectively checked the weight of passengers carry on luggage. And charged extra $60 for an upgrade to 10kg carry on. As a comparison, Virgin Australia checked the same carry on luggage and let us go without extra charge.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Sydney. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. Terrible service, when I was trying to check my bag the ladies from the Jetstar staff didn't even approach me or the rest of the people looking for help. They had a horrible attitude and they looked so upset if you called them for help. Seriously, if they don't want to do their job they shouldn't be there. I had to also paid an extra $60 because I exceeded 2 kg. What a rip off. I definitely won't fly with Jetstar ever again. My first experience with Jetstar was horrible.",1
2019,"Singapore to Bangkok. This is the worst airline I flew, here was no inflight entertainment you had to pay $4 for water and even worse you couldnt bring your own water on the plane. The seats were uncomfortable with no blankets and pillows.",1
2019,"Sydney to Perth with Jetstar Airways. We had the worst flight ever. It wasn't even particularly cheap! The flight was delayed 2 and a half hours with no warning. Told at bag check it was due to bad weather? It was fine weather. Told at check in the delay was 1 and a half hours. That was a lie. Once on the plane we waited on tarmac for 20 plus minutes to get someone's bags off. Pilot made no mention of bad weather. He told passengers he was sorry for the delay. Said they had been running late all day and now this flight was very delayed. Plane was almost full. 3x3 seats. Old plane felt so cheap and old fashioned like you might find in developing nations. There was no service after first offer of food and drinks, all charged for and running out of choice. My seat was so cramped. It had hardly any padding. I used my coat to save my back as chair back was so thin the ""wires"" stuck into me. It was so cramped I didn't leave my seat for the whole flight. A big man had the aisle seat and he slept the whole flight. I was dehydrated so could ""hang on"". My husband and I are slim. His backside ached the whole trip. I have just got back from the physio as my neck is out! My thighs have ached badly all day yesterday. After all the delays there was no sweetener like a free drink. I asked for water on the one and only service run. The staff member suggested I have a glass, as a bottle was $4. We got one small plastic cup of water. Nothing else. Never again. Qantas should be ashamed to be associated with this disgraceful airline. So mean spirited.",1
2019,Sydney to Hobart. I try and avoid flying Jetstar as whenever I do they do not fail in delivering a series of delays with really poor reasons. I can only guess they are massively understaffed and only use junior employees. Avoid unless no other option.,1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Customer service was not friendly at all. I was traveling with a guitar which has fitted in the smallest of overhead compartments, but they would not let me carry it on. When I asked if it would make the trip checked in, she just had me sign a liability release form. She would not let me fly without signing this form. Then, she charged me for the guitar as ""oversized baggage"" which on any other Airline, and every other Airline on which I've traveled, it qualified as a carry on. She also stated I never claimed any baggage on my reservation. I told her I never had the option, but she argued with me stating the option was there, when in fact, I booked the travel and there was no option through that agency. The representative was rude and unwavering, and an absolutely poor representative of any Airline, of all Airlines I have flown. Based on this experience with her, I would not recommend Jetstar Airways to anyone.",1
2019,Bangkok to Melbourne. Just don't book your ticket with this airline. I had a direct flight from Bangkok to Melbourne 8.50 hours. It got canceled on the morning I was flying due crewing requirements. The ticket they could offer me was a flight from 20 hours and a layover. The next day it would again be a 20 hours flight. When I asked what they would do to compensate this flight the answer was: a refreshment voucher. They wouldn't book a flight I had found with a different airline because they wouldn't be able to guarantee the safety of the flight. So I booked a other flight with a different company and I needed to pay this myself. The staff was not helpful at all.,1
2019,"Denpasar to Adelaide. As expected Security at Denpasar Airport took our water so we bought some more water before boarding. But that was also taken from us immediately before boarding the overnight flight to Adelaide. For unexplained reasons take off was delayed by 90 minutes. We had to wait for the trolley service before we could get water and then they made us pay $4 for a tiny bottle of the stuff (must be liquid gold). And they don't take cash only Credit Cards. On a similar flight, my elderly sister-in-law was gasping for water but her Debit Card wasn't accepted, nor was her cash, so she went without water, food and drink for the five-hour flight. This is not acceptable! It should be compulsory for all airlines to provide water as a health and safety requirement.",1
2019,"On Monday 16 September I flew with Jetstar from Melbourne to Sydney ( flight JQ 520 ) The crew was unbelievable unfriendly. I was taking a video in front of the plane. Apparently thats dangerous, I didnt know. Instead of explaining me calmly she starts getting crazy and being super rude. She didnt greet me when I enter the plane. Sorry but is that your kinda service? I pay for a flight and dont want to get treated rude by staff. The staff on the ground treat you like a number? They weigh your bag before entering the plane - where is the trust? I really dont recommend this airline.",1
2019,"Denpasar to Sydney. I couldnt check in online or over the phone. It is our honeymoon and we wouldve like to pick a window seat to sit together but they have placed us in the middle of the plane. Weve left ample time to check in, they have bullet points for rules to check in and none of them applied to us and yet we still cannot check in or choose a seat. Called the number and they could still not help us out at all. Useless service, and now we are stuck in the middle of a plane for six hours. Thanks a lot Jetstar. Will never use you again.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Sydney. I went to get my luggage weighed and was 2kg over. Upon asking questions regarding the charge of a $60 flat fee, I was answered by the check in staff member stating I dont have to explain myself. I am highly disgusted at her abrupt attitude. Possibly may be that she is an older staff member an needs another induction in customer service. When I asked her for her name, she became defiant refusing to give me her name. She told her supervisor, who was very professional and encouraged us to voice our concerns online- he was more concerned about the delayed flights on the day - prioritising real problems. When we finally made it on the plane, someone was sitting in my seat. One of the cabin staff said to the passenger move your in the wrong seat- youre holding everyone up he was apologetic, never flying with this airline again. Were finally sitting down 18 minutes later and havent taken off yet.",1
2019,"Gold Coast to Sydney. Delayed, then continually delayed (did not notify us), then cancelled (also did not notify us until after I'd found out and booked with another airline). They had already cancelled my flight up on Saturday and now this one too? I had no choice but to book another airline to get up here, and have had to do the same to get home - a day late. I accepted the voucher for the first one but I'll fight them for a refund this time. Terrible communication and service. Don't use Jetstar Airways.",1
2019,"Townsville to Melbourne via Sydney. The worst airline I have ever flown in. The seats are uncomfortable and no food is served unless paid for, and even then, they run out of almost everything before they travel to the fourth row. The air hostesses are not friendly or welcoming, except for 1 or 2. The flights were delayed. Its as if they think they are the best airline but they are so horrible; worse than flights in PNG, in my opinion, and those are bad as well. I never want to travel Jetstar again, they are the worst.",1
2019,"Brisbane to Phuket via Melbourne. Jetstar you suck to the MAX! We had a flight to Phuket via Sydney on the 21st August cancelled and rebooked for the 23rd. We had booked upfront seats and business class and we were advised that it is ALL the same only the flight will go via Melbourne. After been told by the airport staff and the call centre staff that we would not lose the seats we had paid for, we get on the plane and told that we don't have business class seats (we lined up in business class and they didn't say anything, the gate staff said nothing) they reckon they would refund the extra money I spent on the seats in 5-7 business days, gave us 6 seats (we could only use 2) and food and beverage at no cost! POOR customer service, useless excuses and compromise only on their terms. I won't use Jetstar again!",1
2019,"Bali to Melbourne. I passed through all checks got to the gate area found a seat to wait to board (almost fell asleep, nice) then everyone was asked to get up leave and return for a 2nd check at the same gate area! I'm all for security but I was airside by this stage. Had a very basic bag check (again) then took my original seat in the lounge.",1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne short haul flight. Due to windy conditions only one runway was open in Melbourne, causing significant delays in the flight. Unfortunately, as a budget airline, flight was delayed for 90 minutes. My companion, who was flying a full-service Australian airline, was scheduled to leave later but arrived 30 minutes earlier than my flight. Goes to show that the pecking order is very different if you are flying budget! The flight itself was just okay - seats are uncomfortably tight (and I am not a tall or big person) and barely acceptable for a short flight. Service was reasonable and staff are not too draconian with luggage. Boarding was somewhat chaotic.",1
2019,"Cairns to Osaka. Jetstar was one of the worst airlines I've ever used and I have travelled more than 20 different countries. I booked the ticket thru a travelling company, but I got a cancellation message from Jetstar 4 hours before the flight. I had to contact to the travelling company and had to reschedule the whole journey by myself. Jetstar said they will reimburse every extra expenses that I had to spent due to the cancellation but I've never got any replies from them after a month long waiting. I liked their cheap price but the inconvenience that I unfortunately went thru was good enough reason for me not to use them again.",1
2019,"I had an awful experience at check-in on Jet Star out of Singapore. In the air the service was fine, but check-in was beyond dreadful. My wife and I had flown Air Asia from Phuket to Singapore on 14th, and I must say their check in was trouble free. On return from Singapore on 19th, however, your check-in clerk first demanded to see my Thai Residence Card. Of course there is no such thing as I explained to the clerks evident displeasure, and implied disbelief. Then she wanted to know which bag was mine. My wife and I had one suitcase for our clothes, one bag for our shoes and paraphernalia, and one hand bag each. Check-in bags weighed just over 32 kg. I had purchased 20kg of luggage, and my wife had purchased 15kg so I had no concerns over weight. However your clerk insisted that luggage cannot be combined, and that one bag must be mine, and the other could be my wifes, so I agreed that the suitcase could be mine, whereupon she demanded payment for 7kg overweight on my case, despite the total being well within our purchased 35kg. Naturally I was not attracted to her proposal. So then I had to remove some contents of the suitcase and put them in the shoe bag, remove bulky but light items from the shoe bag and put them in a new carry-on bag purchased from Smiths, and make my carry-on briefcase into a check-in bag. This took a lot of time, so your clerk wanted me to do that away from check-in because I was now causing a backlog in the queue. Of course this was impossible, because I needed access to the scales to balance each bag to a spurious amount. The frustration mounted in all quarters. Your clerk told me its not my fault its Company policy. I told her she represented the Company, and that this was unacceptable. Certainly I would not permit one of my staff to say that. We finally got our boarding passes, no money had changed hands, everyone was frustrated, no-one benefited, I was thoroughly stressed, and we had lost all the time we had planned to spend in the airport. Then I saw that your clerk had not given my wife and I adjoining seats. All other seats are taken, and this is the closest I can give you she told me. This was a lie. When I took my seat, both seats next to me were empty and so were the entire two rows in front of me. This was resolved painlessly on the aircraft by helpful and charming flight crew, but I was so unhappy by then that I have vowed never again to take Jet Star if I had an alternative. And of course I regale all my friends with the story. Their response? Typical Jet Star. I do not expect frills with a low-cost airline, but I expect common sense, and some understanding that the passenger is not just a process item. Air Asia is streets ahead.",1
2019,"Auckland via Wellington. we were going to a family bereavement, had a hotel and rental car booked in Auckland, checked in received my boarding passes, then 5 minutes later a flight cancellation arrived. The time from cancellation to departure was less than two hours, we were changed, packed, taxi ordered - no flights available that day.Sorry,  how about tomorrow and sorry we dont refund hotel and rentals. You're better off to walk ... its more reliable if you have a timetable, if you're totally flexible it may be ok. We travel to this destination monthly and this is the third issue of a "" engineering "" nature in the last year",1
2019,"Flight was my teenage daughters first flight by herself, even though she is 19 she is still a young lady by herself, it was to leave at 4.45, did not board until 5.15 left at 5.55pm, not too awful, so I was not worried too much, but they got diverted to Avalon in Melbourne instead of flying direct to Tullamarine, so instead of my daughter getting to the airport at 7.50pm or at the latest 8.30pm, they finally get there at after 11pm. She is by herself has to catch a bus to the city, does not no if she will be able to check in to her hotel room by the time the sky bus gets her there, nothing is offered, no one cares. Glass of warm tap water is what they were offered while they spent hours on the tarmac, the cabin crew were down right uncaring and rude. All in all worst airline ever. Be better off going to Brisbane and going on Tigerair. Never ever will we fly with Jetstar Airways again. Leaving people stranded for hours and not caring at all, nice one Jetstar. So many people missed flights to other places, missed their buses you name it. So instead of being safe in her hotel room at a good time of night my daughter was left to do all of this into the early hours of the next morning. She was to be there before 8 people, think of that that is not good enough.",1
2019,"Singapore to Melbourne. Yesterday Jetstar informed us that our 22:50 flight to Melbourne was rescheduled to 07:30 the following day due to maintenance issues. Thankfully my 5 year old daughter and myself were staying in the same room as my husband who was travelling for business, but we had to pay an extra $90 for the additional night for the rollaway bed for her. So we wake up at 3:30am today, wait and wait and wait and 30 minutes before the plane is scheduled to depart, there is no sign of the plane. Everyone was left wondering without any word from jetstar. Thirty minutes after the expected departure, the Captain announced that there will be an additional 3 hour delay. We had all been security screened at Gate D34, and will need to repeat the process again when the next gate is selected. We were told that there were $20 food vouchers available only at Burger King (again the same as last night). Apparently as a customer, our lost time is not valuable at all. You have failed us in your offering Jetstar and this is not satisfactory at all. Will not be flying with you again",1
2019,We flew Jetstar from Brisbane to Hobart on the 12th of August 2019 and returned the 15th of August. I had a wheelchair and Jetstar was absolutely amazing with their customer service with checking in at BNE airport. We (my mother and I) were checked in through the fast track lane and where given one of Jetstars wheelchairs to use. Very impressed. We then were boarded first and upgraded to the Seats with more legroom for free. Which was a nice surprise (we were upgraded on the return flight too). They had the lift to the aircraft waiting for us. Return flight was the same. Absolutely impressed considering this is a budget airline.,0
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne via Avalon. Endless delays - engineering problems, late incoming airplane, etc. Simply operational incompetence. Horrible customer service with no interest to keep good customer relationship or protect company reputation. One of the worst airlines at times even outperforming Tiger. No more JetStar, enough is enough. Now Qantas and Virgin for domestic flights in Australia.",1
2019,"Worst flight ever. Flight was cancelled due to bad weather, the day was so clear nice and sunny. I was given two options either to rebook flight 2 days later where I have to pay my accommodation in expensive city like Sydney for 2 nights or refund. I had to pay $500 (Where I paid $100 to book this flight) to rebook another flight next day and they offered me voucher than cash refund.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Cairns. Jetstar is a budget airline so expectations should not be set too high. Having said that they should be efficient and professional. The flight to Cairns is just over 3 hours and was without incident, the staff went about their role in a business-like manner and provided food and drinks to purchase. The flight back was not quite as good. The forward toilet had the ""engaged"" light on from the start and I decided to check it out, there was a lady waiting who said that one of the flight attendants said there was someone in there. We concluded that if that was the case then due to the time they were in there they may have had a medical incident, so I decided to open the door. I discovered that there was no one in there but someone had thrown up in the sink and it was still there. In the meantime one of the flight attendants returned and proceeded to reprimand me for opening the door. Another flight attendant was talking to a passenger and was doing so for a large portion of the trip, another was in the last row reading a book. A couple of observations, the toilet appeared to be blocked from the time of leaving Cairns, why was it not fix prior to departure? There appeared to be a lack of service from the flight attendants. No information was passed on to the passengers regarding the forward toilet being out of action. An incident like this doesn't mean that Jetstar is a bad airline. There may be a need to train the staff on their attitude. Maybe their attitude is ""this is a budget airline so suck it up"". Anyway, apart from the minor incident it wasn't a bad flight although the seats are a bit hard after a few hours.",0
2019,Absolutely disgusted! My wife is flying Jetstar tonight to Cairns on a last minute flight to see her mum who is extremely unwell. She packed in a hurry into carry on baggage. At the flight gate the airline weighed her bags to find that her two bags weighed 9kg not 7kg. As a result they have charged her a total of $90 additional cost in order to enable her to carry the additional 2 kg from Brisbane to Cairns and back. This type of behaviour from an airline to its customers is an absolute disgrace. The airline should honestly be ashamed of itself. I expect that the airline has absolutely no interest in listening to this feedback.,1
2019,"Long story short. Flight was cancelled. Couldnt get us alternative flight to Sydney within 24hours even if we drove to Brissie or Gold Coast. Decide to be on call for next flight- it is also cancelled. Drive to Ballina to fly out morning next day. Lose day in Sydney, lose accommodation cost, costs us fuel, night accommodation in Ballina and parking costs. But this is not the final straw. The final straw is on return journey our luggage is 6kg over (combined 3 people), same weight as when we flew there, and they charged us $120 - what the. Could have charged us $60 for one person being over or $45 to check one bag but nope charge us for two bags being over (werent aloud to split with between three of us). They were rude and didnt care that they had already cost us over $400 for our one day holiday that was meant to be a weekend away for my sons birthday. Was a regular customer and had a Jetstar card. No more.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Sydney. Avoid this airline. Trust me it is worth paying a bit extra for an airline that has at least some notion of customer service. Today Jetstar cancelled our flight with only 6 hrs notice and informed us that they could not possibly get us on an alternative flight until tomorrow. This is bad enough but even worse is the way they insult your intelligence by spinning the lie that the cancellation is due to ""weather conditions"" (clearly a lie as not only did other airlines have flights on the same route , Jetstar themselves had flights leaving both before and after the one they had chosen to cancel.) This is the 2nd time in 14 months Jetstar has cancelled on us with their ""too bad your problem"" attitude. There will not be a third time because only if Jetstar were the only airline left flying would I board them again.",1
2019,"This review is about their customer service. I had a problem booking tickets online and called immediately. Their customer service not only tried to make it seem like they didn't speak English or understand what I was saying, but proceeded to give me the run around, and put me on hold 5 times. I was on the phone for over an hour. I called again and I requested to speak to a Manager, and could not even get the name of the Manager on, or get transferred to him for another 45 minutes. Once speaking to the Manager, he explained to me that the company does not hold any responsibility for anything that happens on their website and that he would not do anything at all to try to help me with my frustration and distress. Please be very careful booking through this agency. The customer service is not there to help you.",1
2019,Sydney to Melbourne. A good reminder not to fly Jetstar. I was just over the baggage weight allowance and got hit with a fine. Excessive fine for *just* being over the limit. Money grab and poor service.,1
2019,"Recently flew from Melbourne to Bangkok on Jetstar. Let me first say Jetstar is a budget carrier and as a such if expect a full service airline experience you will be disappointed. I always start flights with budget carriers by expecting a ""budget ""experience. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this flight, the majority of things worked well. We arrived early (always wise with budget carriers) and spent very little time with the check in process and all went according to plan as we had paid the extra for checked bags and seat selection. Flight left on time and we had a small but pleasant meal. The only problem we had was my wife had paid for the entertainment and she had trouble with the volume in her seat. It was a 787 which are very good planes, the seats were comfortable and space ok for economy, I have had worse experiences in full service airlines. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would I fly Jetstar again? Yes no problem.",0
2019,"Denpasar to Melbourne. Did not bother to let us know until check in time was almost finished. No offer to assist pregnant sick wife and baby!  Will chose another airline next time. Last time i used jetstar they canceled the flight altogether but only after we were already onboard waiting in the heat with no aircon in Singapore. That time was the same, no caring, terrible customer service.",1
2019,Ayers Rock to Sydney. Flight was delayed by four hours. We werent kept up to date with an accurate time of departure. The flight was almost the same price as Virgin. Overall a very poor experience.,1
2019,"I flew from Auckland - Dunedin (North - South Island of NZ). I booked the flight and then looked at reviews - which is unusual for me as reviews are important to me. However, I am glad I chose to it this way round otherwise I wouldnt have flown with jetstar. Once I booked I felt like I had made a mistake after seeing all of this bad reviews. I chose jetstar as the timing was great for me and so was the price. About $60 cheaper than air new zealand. I had just flown in from the UK and had checked myself in online and used the self service kiosk at Auckland airport to get the baggage tags. Auckland airport did have quite a long queue. Flights to queenstown, Christchurch, Dunedin & wellington were checking in. But the airport is very small so you wasnt missing anything past check in anyway. Took me around 10 mins wait to get to the front (baring in mind that I was about the 40th behind so pretty fast. The lady at check in wasnt particularly polite. But I was infront of her for less than 30 seconds. Passed me a boarding card and off I went. I know my luggage was about a kilo over too but nothing was mentioned and I didnt need to pay any fee - however, if I did have to I wouldnt have complained and blamed the airline. this is my problem. I know the baggage allowance and so does everyone else!!. Baggage wasnt weighed for cabin, though they said several times that 7kg is the limit. So again, anyone who is over and charged the 60... there are NUMEROUS announcements before check in, and also information online about this so if youre over you have to pay. I dont understand the annoyance. Flight left on time & arrived on time. Pleasant crew, 3 female air hostess and a cabin manager called Dave. Was very nice. 2 females in the cockpit. Nice to hear from the pilot in the air as often when flying with cheap airlines they dont bother to speak to passengers I have found. Plane very clean and modern. I am a very nervous flier and the staff really make a difference to how I feel when I am in the air. This flight team made me so comfortable. I got off the plane and went to the loo. By time I got back the luggage was unloaded and just mine on the belt, so very  fast. You cant pay with cash on the plane - but again there is info on this online so its other peoples fault for not checking. Superb service and fight I will fly with jetstar again in a heart beat.",0
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. I am appalled at how officious and rude so many of the staff we dealt with today were. My elderly parents were injured in an accident on the way to the airport. We missed our flight home and needed help to change the flights. We were told there was no guarantee, it was unlikely we would get a medical waiver and would have to pay for new flights. Despite both parents having head injuries not one of the five different staff we spoke to on the phone and at the counters offered us the advice that we should label our parents as needs assistance so that they could use a wheelchair. It was only when we saw one and asked if we could use it that one staff member finally clued us in to this provision! We needed assistance and everyone treated us like we were being a massive pain for them! We had to wait 8 hours for the next flight, making an already traumatic day just so much more exhausting and horrendous for us. I will never again fly with Jetstar: cheap fares just means no consideration. Thanks for nothing Jetstar!! Michelle",1
2019,"We flew with Jetstar from Sydney to Honolulu return in economy class as a family we pre ordered our meals and entertainment prior leaving. We were welcomed onto the aircraft by staff, the aircraft was clean on both trips, it left Sydney 5 minutes early, meals were good value. In flight entertainment has plenty of choice. Only downfall was the Check in on Hawaii end was a little slow checking in. Overall a good flight, leg room was a little tight for us over 6 footers",0
2019,Cooloongatta to Sydney. Understand luggage limit of 7 kg. We were over each by about half kilo. We had paid for extra 20 kilo each hold storage but figured we didnt need it. We were charged $60 extra for what was a minor difference and was not allowed to consider what we had paid and not used in hold. The attitude was aggressive and most unpleasant. Why any organisation would wish to alienate their customers this way beggared belief Never again jet star. It was not only what happened but the officious way in which it was done. Talk about brand damage!,1
2019,Sydney to Melbourne. Terrible customer service. No heart. Act and carry on like youd expect from a budget airline. I wont be travelling with them again anytime soon. Qantas for me.,1
2019,Townsville to Brisbane. Ive flown all over the world and have never had such bad customer service. Lady at the counter was not helpful or willing to assist me in any way. If you fly with them make sure you leave plenty of time or they wont let you check baggage and get on the plane!!! Wont be using them again!,1
2019,"Waiting for more than six hours in Cairns airport being told we could not leave unless we were back before 12.45 even though the aircraft boarded, then cancelled several times prior to the 4 pm departure. Jetstar informed me that I had agreed to this by agreeing to pay for their flight. So money does not provide a service, only a suggestion of a service. Do not trust this airline, they are a dubious business run for money without the service paid for. Very disappointed.",1
2019,"Sydney to Phuket. Absolutely disgusting service and communication - my flight back to Sydney was canceled at 2 pm for a night flight at 10.05 pm the same day. Impossible to talk to anyone only through ""let's chat"". As quick as starting a ""Lets Chat"" conversation I was told my only option was to take a refund which can take up to 7 Business Days to refund which is ridiculous considering you take the money from my account instantly. I have now been desperately trying to find another flight home along with the other 300 or so passengers I'm sure! Never again Jetstar, I refuse to use your way below average service again. Even AirAsia do a better job!",1
2019,"Cairns to Melbourne. Appalling customer service flight up to Cairns cancelled, informed by text message at 01.45 am only to spend next 40 min finding an alternative flight that was over 4 hrs later. Only communication is via text! Flight from Cairns to Melbourne delayed by over 3.5 hours. Very poor communication left stranded for hours with few updates and no genuine apologies or care. Do not fly Jetstar unless you like spending time sitting around airports.",1
2019,JQ 401 on July 14th was cancelled due to staff shortage. Were kept waiting and chased from gate to gate forwards and backwards only to be told after 3 hrs that the flight was cancelled. Were offered transport to ibis hotel at olympic park after another 4 hrs am wait. We preferred to take the train where we had to deal with our luggage and changing trains 3 x. The food allowance was $30 in a hotel where the cheapest hot dinner meal costs $28. No money left for the $35 breakfast. The first flight they could book us on was the following day at 2:35 pm. At 2:29 we were told the captain is late for work.,1
2019,"Cancelled my flight from Sydney to Gold Coast. Moved my flight to afternoon the next day and refused to time so I can change hotel bookings and ruined whole trip. Made me lose money and I lost and wasted multiple bookings in Gold Coast for different trains, entertainment, and my next flight.",1
2019,Sydney to Brisbane. Cheap airline blaming weather conditions to cancel flights with next availability more than 36 hours from the original time. Jetstar was the only airline cancelling its flight. No chat or phone line available to help.  Shame on you Jetstar.,1
2019,"Melbourne to Hobart. Worst airline for punctuality flying Australian domestic routes. This airlines website provided no flight delays on their app 1 hour prior to arrival. Staff could not provide a reason, when queried, As to why the flight was so delayed. If you have commitments at your destination dont fly with them, it is an airline of last resort.",1
2019,"Melbourne (MEL) to Coolangatta (OOL). Jetstar is probably one of the best cheap airlines in Australia. They have friendly staff, decent seats with generous leg-room and meals/beverages that are nice but not excessively priced. I have flown Jetstar numerous times and have never let me down!",0
2019,"Sydney to Nadi with Jetstar Airways. My checked luggage did not arrive with my flight in Fiji until 4 days after I arrived. This is is because, and I quote an employee, the aircraft had too many bags, so we had to take some off. When I returned home I began seeking compensation for the lazy mistake but the advisor was only willing to pass a message onto management.",1
2019,"Launceston to Sydney. Weather was very bad with extreme fog lingering all day meaning that most flights in and out were cancelled. This is not the bit that bothers me because weather is something out of an airlines control. What is in Jetstar's control is rescheduling. Instead of running a flight the next day for us, Jetstar instead tried dumping passengers on pre-existing flights, all of which were booked out until Tuesday! (My flight was supposed to be Sunday). If they had put on another flight on Monday, I would not mind. Customer service at Jetstar is extremely lacking. Would not even offer me a cash refund, instead trying to offer me a voucher! I had to spend hundreds rebooking myself on a Virgin Australia flight the next day in some hope of trying to salvage my hotel booking in Sydney and getting myself onto my International flight a day later.",1
2019,"Arrived at terminal to see on the departure board that my flight was delayed. I was not notified by email or text that it had been delayed. If I had been, I would have left a lot later from home. Then it was delayed, a second time. I'm now waiting almost 3 hours to get on a flight which takes 50 minutes to get to my destination. I asked the reception workers what is going on, they have no answer. I have never had issues with Air NZ, they always communicate any delays via email. If I had more money I would have flown with them. Jetstar, you need to improve your services. This is unacceptable! Do you even bother to read your reviews? So many negative reviews, I'm surprised that you get any business. I will not be traveling with you again.",1
2019,"Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. We booked two round way tickets - Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh. Due to health issues we needed an upgrade to business class on our flight back to Australia. We paid an additional $1584.22 for the upgrade. We were not advised there would be no refund applicable if our flight was cancelled (we have saved the chat history evidence, no such policies were mentioned). Due to foreseen circumstances, the original flight was cancelled and we were forced on to economy on the replacement flight when there were more than 2 seats available in the business cabin. (The response from their customers' service regarding this complaint was there were no seats in business which is not true) We were ensured by Jetstar staff we were guaranteed with business class seats on the replacement flight (online customer service representative and ground staff who Ive confirmed with on the night of the cancellation ). I have saved all the chat history with the customer service representative. The Jetstar customer service representative has given us misleading information. Also in the attached itinerary, it shows our return flight is BUSINESS. If we were told originally that there would be no refund applicable in the event our flight was cancelled, we would not have upgraded the tickets in the first place. In summary, Jetstar has misled us and failed to deliver the service promised and subsequently stolen 1584.22 dollars from us. This is not a small amount of money and it was paid for a service which wasn't delivered. If we didn't pay for the upgrade, we will come home with zero additional cost. After lodging a complaint, they offered some travel vouchers (with time limits) as compensation.  We do not want some travel vouchers as a refund, we need our full payment for the upgrade back.",1
2019,I will never fly Jetstar again. On 21st June 2019 I was meant to fly from Perth to Bali the flight was cancelled for no reason at all. I was put on another flight the next day but before I left home I got a text from Jetstar saying my flight was delayed again. I went to the airport and I finally left Perth at 4pm on Saturday afternoon of the 22nd June.,1
2019,"Melbourne to Sydney. Horrible service. The face-to-face service at the time of boarding was humiliating and unnecessary, the official started to Scream saying that I didn't have the ticket of boarding while I was looking for the boarding on my bag. I find it give to him and after that they tore up my ticket claiming that I had not understood the first time they asked me if there had been an emergency and they moved the seat to humiliate me even more in front of several customers who were in the queue.",1
2019,"Adelaide to Melbourne. Use baggage rules that make no sense or difference to the outcome to scam money from you. Even though I had check in luggage allowance, my bag was so small and light that I just carried it on. Travelling for business though, so my laptop tipped me over the 7kg limit. So they pinged me $60 at the gate. Never flying with these scam artists again.",1
2019,"Queenstown to Gold Coast via Cairns. They weighed and charged me $60 for my handbag. This is apparently their thing. Included in your 7kg carry on is your handbag and they enforce it and charged me $60 for 2kg! Way to ruin a holiday. First time Jetstar and never again. The planes was filthy, food and spills on both planes from QT. No screens on international leg & extra crammed seating. May I also suggest having 2 Menus instead of cheapskates using the same one when certain items arent available on domestic flights. Not looking forward to the flight back.",1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Seems with this airline that the flight staff have plenty of attitude and no customer service abilities. Honestly, the quicker they understand the customer comes first and not there work colleagues and there hair extensions the better this airline will be.",1
2019,"Sydney To Brisbane. So far lately I have not had any disruption from Jetstar and with this latest flight I thought they deserve some positivity. Check In was efficient followed by security, I find them more clueless than frequent flyers and most likely need more training. Boarding was slightly delayed because of baggage restriction being imposed on passengers who have gone over their limit. The cabin crew were mediocre, but being an LLC that's the standard. Arrival was early plus by the time I reached the arrivals hall my luggage was ready for collection, by far the fastest experience I have come across. Keep up the good work.",0
2019,"Brisbane to Denpasar-Bali. I have flown with Jetstar from the very beginning when I first started flying and have never had a problem until now. My first international trip was a disaster to say the least. First of all we checked in and dealt with a rude staff member who separated my sister and I on the plane because he did not speak clearly whilst asking if I would able to help with the emergency exit if it were to come to that. Because he didnt speak clearly I then said sorry? And then told me its not a joke and they take it very seriously so you cant sit together. Fair enough although I did not hear this man so I found it very irritating to seperate us based on the fact he didnt speak clear enough. After our flight we landed in Denpasar (Bali), we went to collect our luggage, stood there for an hour and my bag was no where to be found. After talking to the luggage people at the Denpasar airport, they have gave us a piece of paper and we had not heard anything else. We then put in a claim with Jetstar and waited to hear back from them, we found out our luggage had never actually left Brisbane, where we departed from. This was extremely frustrating as we were in a foreign country with no more then a couple pieces of clothes. Meanwhile waiting to hear back from Jetstar we had to spend a lot of money just to accomodate ourselves with clothes and everyday necessities. We had money, expensive clothes and undergarments in this bag. We finally heard from Jetstar 2 days into our trip saying our baggage was in Bali and they would deliver it to us at our villa. We sent our address and never heard back, here we are leaving and still dont have our luggage. We went a week without anything, we constantly emailed Jetstar to see what they would do to compensate for this massive problem and they showed no compassion or care for what has happened and have only told us to wait. Luckily a nice man at the Denpasar airport has located our luggage and has set it up on our flight back home and that is the service we wanted. Jetstar has still not done anything at all to help, fix or apologise for this entire issue. Safe to say wont be flying with Jetstar again.",1
2019,"Tokyo to Brisbane via Cairns. You may be able to get cheap flights but then they cancel them on you. We bought return flights to Japan They cancelled our return flight and we had to book an extra night at the hotel and then 2 days before we were due to fly back they cancelled it again. They never gave us any options for the date we were supposed to return or the next day so I got on line and booked the very next day but had to fly via Osaka. Flights cost $1200 they refunded $350 and we had to pay another $2000 to get home. Jetstar insurance wouldn't help us either. Worst company ever and we had to pay for food, entertainment everything that is free on other international flights.",1
2019,"Taipei to Da Nang. Not only are the planes as basic as possible, but the staff is beyond unprofessional and will even attempt to scam money from customers. I was traveling with three people and we had two checked bags: they attempted to put them both onto one passenger, to increase the cost for the second bag, without telling me. They have a ""rewards program"" that offers a discount on the flight, but then they don't tell you that it automatically renews a year later (after you've done your best to forget this Godawful airline). Avoid at all costs.",1
2019,"The staff from the check in was rude, nobody smile. The stewardess also  rude, she shouted few times because my son slept on an empty row, somehow the manager came and said its  okay since its an empty seats. It seems Jetstar  hire or train rude people to work as their staff.",1
2019,"Denpasar to Sydney. Staff were rude and lack of customer service. They hardly smiled and when asking for Pen to fill up the declaration form, they just had a rude face and was like ""Somebody borrowed mine"". Pilot was very good though. He was keeping us informed.",0
2019,Sydney to Melbourne. This was one of the worst airline experiences I had for such a short distance. The problem is the outrageous penalty system built in fare system. Apparently they have 7 kg in cabin limit. Anyways I could check in my baggage for free but apparently if I bring it on board they charge it.  I had a back pack which is 8.1 kg while boarding they decide to weigh bags on board. They charged me$60. Look if I had to pay the same price checking in my bag I would not mind. But this is clearly a bad customer policy especially designed to exploit busy people like me who have no time to read fine print.  The ground personal was not helpful either. They were on a tight leash.,1
2019,"Ho Chi Minh city to Sydney. First of all the price is really cheap when comparing to the other airline and because of the cheap price of course the services are not good. The price it showed only the ticket price, not include any other services. You have to pay more for baggage, food or only a blanket and entertainment option. A 8 hours flight with no food, cold but no blanket, bored but cant watch any show. And the seat, super uncomfortable, I dont know why or just my seat but I cant pull down the seat so I cant sleep at all. Obviously this is the worst flight ever.",1
2019,Perth to Bali. I spent so much time on Jetstar website for finding how to add a surfboard. After a while I decided to call them but no one was able to do so. After all I started an online chat for adding the surfboard and finally we payed $50 for it. Once we arrived at the airport Ive been told that the Kg for the surfboard werent in the package so they charged me other $100. Then I had tho pay other $50 for flight back so in total I paid $200 for a surfboard.,1
2019,"When comparing prices, they are deceptive in not clearly showing what all the add on costs could be. They have a shocking web site page whereby to add a seat, food and checked baggage would keep dropping information from the checkout. I had to book singularly for the meal and seat allocation. I could not find costs on baggage as their search details kept telling me they do not fly out of Thailand (only sell seats for such). I could not add the checked baggage option and nor could a friend trying for me in another country. It took hours to try and complete everything and was incredibly frustrating. They do not provide an easy working web site to manage your bookings. They had a chat function, but that was useless for trying to get any help, it was more an automated add on service marketing tool only. Overall experience. I will never use this air service again. $120 Australian dollars paid for check in baggage when the web site had it for around $48. When comparing prices, many other carriers allow 30kg checked baggage. Jetstar are not really comparable on a pricing basis because they charge for anything they can without full disclosure on the compare sites.",1
2019,Auckland to Wellington. Never having flown JetStar before I was a little hesitant however there was no reason to be. The flight is quick so only an hour or so. Seats are comfortable and staff were very friendly on the outbound and pleasant enough on the inbound return flight. We upgraded our seats so we were in the more leg room section but on such a short flight it is not necessary.,0
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Absolutely disgusted that a staff member was giving incorrect information and telling passengers they cant put anything in their pocket. Passengers had less than 2kgs over and were made to pay for extra baggage. When I went to customer service to ask, they confirmed you can have items in your pocket! Their excuse was the lady telling people incorrect information was new and didnt know the rule!  Thats appalling. Staff should know the rules.",0
2019,"Sydney to Gold Coast. After the service I received from the people at the plane gate then charged $60 for 2kg of carry on luggage after being extorted to choose a seat, exactly the same carry on luggage flown twice with on Jetstar in the last 24 hours. I will never fly with Jetstar again. Fly any other airline.",1
2019,Denpasar Bali to Adelaide on Monday May 27. I would just like to thank all the staff that were on that flight.  These ladies obviously all love their work and are passionate about the service the provide. They were very accomodating and attentive and after leaving such a beautiful holiday it was so nice to be greeted with a genuine smile and warmth.  Thankyou for making it such a pleasurable flight.,0
2019,Sydney to Brisbane. Budget service for a budget airline. Honestly I have never met so many rude staff members. From check in to the flight and return they were very rude. Food was overpriced and average but I get that being a budget airline. What I don't understand is why Jetstar offer appalling service when a smile doesn't cost them any extra.,1
2019,"Worst Airline and their pricebeat guarantee is a complete scam.  This has happened to me twice now, I have applied for a pricebeat again at Air Asia, however they take that long to process it that the price on Air Asia has increased and you end up paying more than if you had booked with Air Asia in the first place. I have complained to their chat consultants but they are patronising, rude and have no clue what they are doing. We also had a situation last year where my boyfriend got food poisoning that struck him when we about the board the aircraft, the captain told us we could not fly due to health and safety concerns. I spoke with the Jetstar team and they assured me they would add notes in the booking to say we were denied due to sickness and Jetstar would simply put us on the next available flight once he was better. Two days later I tried to rebook only to be told that there were no notes in the booking and we had been classified as a no show and therefore had purchase a new ticket. Stay away from Jetstar, they will try anything to scam you out of your money.",1
2019,"Christchurch to Bali via Melbourne. Terrible airline, would rather pay extra from now on. Canceling flights 24hr prior and giving a worse flight without telling us. Never again Jetstar, now 17hr flight.",1
2019,"Melboune to Sydney. I buy tickets for seat 1E and check in online already, but when she scan my ticket and she didnt say anything to me, and give me new seat that time I didnt see yet. When i go on airplane staff tell me seat on 5F, I said but I pay $13 and check in already,. She just said she dont know  - how can i ask any question?  I think jetstar need to pay money me back, because I pay for seat on front but she give me seat 5F.",0
2019,Sydney to Denpasar. I have been planning this holiday for a few months. I booked it months in advance for a good price to leave today 19/05/2019 and includes my birthday. I woke up today to the news that my flight was cancelled due to engineering problems. I have used their web chat with 2 people and the customer service response from them was appalling. Both of them thought it was appropriate to say they were sorry for the inconvenience and that I could either rebook it refund. I went the rebook route as it was the easiest for me. So now I will leave on the 21/05/2019 losing 2 days of my holidays. I asked one of them for a refund on my lost accommodation and she said they don't accept liability for this. I would have used my insurance but after the excess was paid it wouldn't have been worth it. I then asked for an upgrade or voucher and she said Jetstar don't offer this. Thanks Jetstar for becoming the worst airline In my eyes. Your service and lack of compassion is your customer service,1
2019,"Perth to Melbourne. Poor customer service would never fly this airline again. The staff is rude and not helpful in any way possible. My two daughters and I flew to Melbourne but got stopped on the way with our hand luggage and was told it weighed over because the included my purse and I was made to pay $90 to a staff member who thought he was top of the food chain. For budget flights, I would rather fly Tigerair.",1
2019,"Auckland to Melbourne. I'd like to congratulate Jetstar on their fabulous customer service! My flight was delayed for 9 hours (the Captain was unexpectedly sick), and I was given $40 worth of food vouchers, put up in a four-star hotel with shuttles and provided another $30 for a dinner at the restaurant. The poor Jetstar staff copped a lot of flack. Jetstar always gets kicked when something goes wrong, but this is my first delayed flight with them (out of about 20) and Air NZ have delayed flights I've been on a few times. Plus they're always cheaper.",0
2019,Sydney to Gold Coast. Staff less than polite Lady weighs bags at plane entry and we are 3 kgs over so we are directed to pay $60. The guy who took the money from us lacked customer service skills - was less that responsive when we approached him to pay money and was quite rude. Unlikely to fly Jetstar again,1
2019,"Bali via Perth. Really disappointed with this low cost company especially on the flight back from Bali to Perth where after doing all the metal detector checking, I stopped to get some breakfast in the airport and bought 2 bottle of water (quite expensive after the checking but we all know how it is in any airport) for me and my partner to have something to drink during the flight. Once we arrived at the gate the staff was checking our bags and they made us throw away the two brand new bottles. On the flight there was no water and I had to pay again a stupid amount for a tiny bottle of water. I understand all the security rules but this is the first time that I have this problem and it is clear that is nothing about security it's just a company that want to make you spend more money on the plane in a cheeky way. Will never fly with you again.",1
2019,"Lowest possible rating. Not only were we delayed but staff didnt care, werent helpful and seemed resigned to the delay as a usual occurrence. This airline deserves their last place rating. I wish I had known about it before booking.",1
2019,"No customer service at all. We booked from Honolulu to Brisbane, although we were flexible with days there were no options to fly direct. The connecting flight was chosen for us by the booking system, you would think that the timing would be efficient but think again. Once you clear customs and collect your bags in Sydney you need to get to the domestic airport. The 2 choices of transfer shuttle are Virgin and Qantas, so we headed to the latter as Jetstar is Qantas and this particular flight was code shared Qantas / Jetstar. There is a sign at the transfer shuttle area informing Jetstar clients that they need to make their own way to the Domestic terminal and are not allowed to use the transfer shuttle. Once we arrived we went to the bag drop to be told you're too early you cannot drop your bags yet sorry? We are too early? But this is a connecting flight, how can we be too early when Jetstar ticketed the flight - care factor of Jetstar rep - zero. So after a 10+ hour flight we are left standing around the Jetstar counter for 1.5 hours before we can drop our bags so we can go through security and finally have a decent meal. Will never fly Jetstar again.",1
2019,"Queenstown to Auckland. Bad customer service. First staff advised me to transfer 2 kg off my hand carry to my suitcase I'm checking in, as it can go up to 32 kg and 10 kg for my hand carry. As me and my had husband arranged it promptly, when we came back, that staff is no longer there and other staff told us that's not right. I told them to just tell us how much is the extra after dealing with the drama. Bad customer service. They better sort their front staff give them a good training. Stop telling lies as truly, this airline reputation has gone downhill and will never use them again.",1
2019,Perth to Bali. What a joke of an airline! Delayed for 30 hrs and not compensated what so ever. No help from the customer service team. They're dirt cheap for a reason. Wouldn't recommend anyone using this airline,1
2019,"Jet Star - more like Meh-Star! A budget airline they are not! Unless you literally just want a seat. Im surprised they dont charge you for your seat belt. Went with carry on luggage to Hobart via Virgin who were fantastic. On the way home we flew Jetstar. I promised myself last year I wouldnt travel with them again but thought hey Ill give them another chance. They took me out of line and stung me with a baggage charge - included my handbag weight in the overall weight which slightly tipped me over the threshold. Have a heart people! Might I remind that had I been carrying this weight in my hips or thighs it wouldnt have counted but luckily for them Im light. Im surprised they dont charge a fat fee for the heftier passengers but maybe I wont give them any ideas, not happy with their cold attitude - to match the cold Tasmanian weather.",1
2019,Jetstar are terrible to deal with and create stress. Flight was initially direct then we were notified it would change to a stopover in Sydney. That was the start of our frustration as flying with small children is challenging at the best of times. Then on check in we discovered our baggage wasnt included. Although only a couple of kilos over for carry on we would be charged $120 and have to reprint our tickets 3 times from 2 different desks and check in our carry on bags and have to pick up and transfer our own luggage between flights. Due to the tiny seating spaces and my above average height once again I sit separate to my family in some vacant seats offered by one of the flight attendants probably the best and worst service at the same time received. On arrival to Sydney Im advised I can go out and recheck the bags while the family stays inside. So I do so and on attempting this am told I cannot re enter the airport and check my familys bags and they would have to come out and that we couldnt re check them in for another 2 hrs. When we are finally rechecking in we accidentally remove our carry on bag checked stickers and are then told our bags are not packed correctly and they will have to be repacked now waiting to see how the second part of the trip will pan out with a very tired and frustrated family and our second flight is delayed. Extremely disappointing end to our holiday hoping our travel improves.,1
2019,"Sunshine Coast to Sydney. Fly anything but Jetstar. Even the cabin crew look like they dont want to be there. The prices look good until they hit you up for exorbitant baggage charges, obscene prices for food, and aircraft which look as tired and haggard as the staff.",1
2019,"Darwin to Denpasar. In 40 years of flying this is the worst airline I have flown. Service deals are the most unhelpful, boarding is terrible, very inconsistent with baggage fees and no care or support. I will never fly Jetstar Airways again. It ruined my wonderful trip to Darwin. Fly anyone else!",1
2019,Brisbane to Denpasar. Didn't have high expectations flying Jetstar business but  that has changed. Check in at Brisbane was fast as separate check in for business class passengers and priority boarding. Cabin had 21 seats in 2x3x2 configuration I sat in seat 2A. Was welcomed by the cabin crew manager with a glass of champagne. Menus were given and orders taken. Selection of 3 meals I chose omelette which was delicious. Seat width and recline was great for my 6 hour flight and the entertainment was easy to use and had a great selection of content. I would fly business class with Jetstar again and the price was great.,0
2019,"Charged $120 for baggage excess (7.4kg for me and 7.9kg for my wife). Rude, unhelpful staff. Made us pay just minutes before boarding in a very pressured way.  Not ""everyday low prices"" but everyday extra charges. I will never fly Jetstar again, nor recommend it to friends.",1
2019,"Cairns to Gold Coast. Brilliant service! First time flying with Jetstar and had first class service at Gold Coast airport, with staff noticing I needed help and walked me through the very simple check-in process - things have changed since I last travelled! Online service just as professional, both to Cairns and return to GC. Friendly, helpful and professional. Flights left on time and arrived on time (even early in Gold Coast). Bags were there for collection within minutes of landing. I even received texts when boarding gate/s became open. I'm wanting to return one day soon to the Great Barrier Reef and I will definitely fly Jetstar again.",0
2019,Horrible customer service! I am in Canada and booked a ticket from Sydney to Melbourne tonight. I thought I selected a 12.20 pm departure but ticket showed 7.00 am so I immediately called long distance to Australia to correct. Agent was helpful and spoke to manager 4 times on my behalf but manager refused to budge at all. They wanted a change fee of $200 or they could not change! How ridiculous as I literally just made the booking and was clearly an error and not due to my changing any plans. I am very disappointed as Canadian airline would have dealt with differently - in fact within 24 hrs there would be a full refund or change. I will never use Jetstar again.,1
2019,"Putrid service thats all! Im not one to reviews and leave things as they are but this is just awful service and customer care. I was to take a flight out from New Plymouth to Auckland at 3.55pm at 12:30 pm they sent a message to say the flight is cancelled "" engineering issues"" luckily my connecting flight is only the next day but needed to be in auckland by this evening anyway. Called customer nothing they can do, mind you this is a return flight I had booked. Ask them if they could provide a vehicle for me to drive down to Auckland I would then make it by tonight they said no sorry that is not part of the options we can provide. My concern is, if you need to cancel a flight please do so 8 hours before departure this gibes passengers enough time to make alternative arrangements. I will certainly never fly with Jetstar again the airline is way to unreliable.",1
2019,"Will never fly with Jetstar again. We almost missed our flight because the lady at the counter messed everything up even though I had checked in online. After that I couldn't get a boarding pass because the lady wasted too much time and the system said it was closed! The lady just said we had to buy tickets for the next flight! Ridiculous! Luckily we did the check in online and the staff at the airport helped us. The cabin crew were not helpful at all and gave really bad service. Had to call 2 to 3 times just to ask for a cup of water! When we were exiting the aircraft I had my cellphone in my hand and I did not even look at it, a crew member shouted at me and told me to put my phone down! I said I wasn't even using it, he threatened that I would be fined if I still had it in my hand! Jetstar NZ just ruined my trip. Never flying with this ridiculous company again.",1
2019,"Brisbane to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways. Worst experience ever! First of all the staff are rude and do not help you at all, I got to the airport an hour and a half early, I had paid $40 for 20kg of checked luggage when I purchased the tickets and went over by 2kg so went and asked what to do. He said I had a minimum of $60 to pay so I did, less then 2 mins later a lady tells me they overbooked the plane and I didnt have a seat even though I booked months prior to our trip. They got us a seat on a Virgin plane and their baggage limit was different being 23kg per person so we absolutely did not need the extra $60 dollars worth that I spent on a different plane and airline. I went back to the man who charged us extra for a refund and he said he cant do anything so we had to go online and talk to someone else for almost an hour but she just made excuse after excuse not to just give us the refund.",1
2019,"Wellington to Auckland. My experiences: - $120 to change a flight when the original flight was weeks out from departing. Flights are delayed all the time. Of the 13 flights I've taken, 3 have been delayed and 1 has been cancelled. Not a great track record. - They now weigh all baggage to the nearest gram. $60 fee if you're even slightly over. Explain to me how this isn't a money grab. Myself, a 65kg male with a bag weighing 7.1kg, gets charged $60 for an overweight bag when a larger man, probably 120kg+ has an underweight bag and is considered fine. If this actually about weight cumulative weight, my extra 100g would not make a difference. As said, one of my flights was cancelled. Fine, no worries, it happens. The problem is their customer service and focus, or lack thereof on customer satisfaction. Jetstar informed me that I would receive my refund in 7 working days. Warning: This is a lie. I attempted to fly on the 6th January 2019, this flight was cancelled. It is now the 26th April 2019 and still no refund to be seen. I called them today to which I was put on hold for half an hour and told was there was a 'technical glitch'. This 'glitch' seems a little coincidental when I'm asking for money back, especially from a company that loves to money grab at the slightest opportunity and lies about returning refunds. I digress. In my case, they cancelled the last flight out on a Sunday evening to which I had to spend an extra $100 to get to work the next day - not impressed. Might I add 0 compensation for this. You can tell Jetstar is an awful company to work for and their customer support policies highlight that. The girl dealing with my refund call said 'I'm sorry sir, I can understand why you are frustrated but I'm just following company policy'. I told her that my frustrations are not toward her but toward Jetstar as a company and how they operate. I've been on the other side of that coin in hospitality, I know how a disgruntled customer feels. I expressed to her that my frustrations were not with her, told her to enjoy her day and thanked her for her help. She thanked me at the end of the call for my understanding and to quote, I was the 'first person to ever say that'. Back to the point. This is a warning to anyone else - this company does not care about you. They do not care about their airline ranking. They don't care about providing customer satisfaction. All they care about is money.",1
2019,"Gold Coast to Melbourne. This is the worst Airline I have ever seen. Horrible customer care, rude. Would not recommend this company to anyone.",1
2019,"Sydney to Ballina. I really dont recommend this airline company. Ive traveled a lot in my life but it is by far the worst airline company I have ever fly with. Crew isnt nice, being charged 60 dollars for 2kgs more. First company ever doing that. The ratio quality/price is not worth it at all. Definitely wont fly with that airline ever again.",1
2019,"This route is already so uncomfortable for all involved! Especially heading from Townsville to Melbourne and the eta being 11.30pm! Honestly the worst crew tonight on my way back from Melbourne to Townsville. The worst I have ever seen. The customer service was so basic - a drink or snack, and admitting you would like something felt rushed, and that we were putting them out. No smiles or genuine care from any of the crew. And no tea or coffee as the heaters are broken. Trash got collected shortly after. Never saw them again. They all went down to the back of the plane until seat belt sign was turned on or we had to prepare to land. No walk throughs or a little chat here and there for a bit of customer engagement and moral. And they had time. The crew  avoided eye contact with passengers. I was really disappointed. And to add insult to injury we get off the flight in Townsville to walk single file, shuffling, tripping, and dragging luggage through a packed cattle crush of folks lined up facing us to get on the  plane back to Melbourne by 11.30pm! Its an experience like no other. Its just not even close to being good enough.",1
2019,Melbourne to Cairns. I flew with Jetstar Airways to save money as the fares were quite cheap but I should not have bothered as I was slugged with a $60 charge for being 3kgs over as they not only weighed my carry on luggage but my handbag as well - which took it over the 7kg and as I was not aware that my handbag would be taken into account i was less than happy. So no checked in luggage and no in-flight entertainment and no food or drinks served. Add that all up plus the $60 extra charge and you would have to be better off flying a better airline and also you would not have to wait in line like cattle and drag your bags onto the tarmac and up the stairs to the plane. Never again,1
2019,Melbourne to Gold Coast. My flight was delayed three times in the one day. I sat in Melbourne airport for nine hours. This is the first & last time I fly with Jetstar. Ive lost an entire day worth of work.,1
2019,"Queenstown to Sydney. Worst airline, flown with Jetstar twice and both times something went wrong, therefore never again. First flight luggage issues, second and last flight was delayed 8 hours, their compensation was an $8 food voucher which is so petty and is no where near equivalent to wasting my whole day, they are a stingy airline that does not care about their customers.",1
2019,"Phuket to Sydney. No food or beverages provided without extra cost. No inflight entertainment without extra cost. I wasn't prepared to pay $8 to watch a 20 year old film. Couldn't even access the games without paying. 8 hour overnight flight with no meals provided, just water.",1
2019,"Me and my family had booked a wonderful holiday from Sydney to Tokyo via Cairns. After going to Cairns, checking in and getting ready to go through customs we got a text message saying our flight was cancelled. The staff were very unhelpful and didnt care at all about my family and myself needs. After waiting hours long and negotiation we were squeezed onto a flight a few hours after our flight but not to Tokyo to Osaka. Once in Osaka we were told nothing at all and left to find our own way to where we needed to be. After about 30 minutes we find someone and they tell us we need to sleep in Osaka then they give us a Jetstar paper promising our flight the day after at 5:40pm. So the next day we need have to rearrange everything, our transfers, our tours, our accomodation, our shuttle bus. Then at 1:18 we came to the airport to check our flight to make sure we have everything sorted then they say our reservation for our flight wasnt booked, the staff werent helping us at all and said they cant help us so you need to go to Tokyo by yourself. This was appalling and really poor poor service. I would never recommend Jetstar because they dont give a care in the world.",1
2019,"Adelaide to Melbourne. There were enough self check-in counters in Adelaide Airport, so I could checked in quickly. My Seat was 6A. The space of the seat was not enough, so I felt uncomfortable. The service of cabin crew was just at the standard level. As a low-cost airlines, there was no meal on this flight. But this flight was value for the price.",0
2019,"Gold Coast to Christchurch. Very pleased with our return flight with Jetstar both legs were on time the plane was spotless, and the service and friendliness of the crew were exemplary.",0
2019,"Melbourne to Perth. Terrible customer service from the point of booking, on board to the point of returning. Absolute scammers. Cant ever talk to someone who understands clear english or what I'm trying to communicate. Very unhelpful staff over the phone. Treat you terrible. No sense of customer service.",1
2019,"We booked a flight Sydney to Bali to fly on Easter Friday, 19/04/2019, months ago. Received a message from Jetstar last night that our flight was canceled ""due to engineering requirements"". Of course, one week before Easter Weekend there were no flights left for Thursday or Friday. ""Manage my booking"" section on Jetstar website still showed my flight as valid, so I couldn't even go and explore alternative flights myself. Had to call the customer service, who confirmed the flight had been canceled and suggested I fly out on Saturday as this is all they had left. I considered a refund to rebook with another airline, but since most of my initial purchase was paid via Jetstar gift card, they could only offer a refund in a form of Jetstar gift card! So now we have to fly on Saturday, it will take us 15 hours instead of 9, we are losing the whole 24 hours at the hotel, which cannot be refunded. The whole experience was just awful, I didn't expect Jetstar to act in such manner. Will do my absolute best to never fly with them again!",1
2019,"We flew from Sydney to Melbourne 11th April flight number JQ513. Charged $60 for being 2kg overweight yet same suitcase and clothes as flight to Sydney last week and was no problem. Staff then had the cheek to ask me to get change from the cafe opposite as had no float or change, and still no eye contact. Will never fly with Jetstar again.",1
2019,Sydney to Launceston. The staff are so rude Ive had this happen multiple times where I will be ready to board and got spoken to terribly. I am actually disgusted in how horribly I have been treated and I definitely wont be flying with Jetstar again.,1
2019,"Melbourne to Launceston. Low cost as in cheap in every way. They nickel and dime you for everything and absolutely gouge you for any extra weight. Want water? That is extra. Pick a seat? Extra. They are the Spirit Airlines of Australia, just a glorified bus company with wings. Never again.",1
2019,"Sydney to Honolulu flying later in April 2019. Giving great marks for Ted the agent I talked to on the phone, he was amazing and super funny, he cracked me up. Great in helping with extra baggage.",0
2019,"Brisbane to Tokyo via Cairns. Flights booked to Japan in June 2019, I tried to cancel (with more than 2 months notice). I was Informed that they will not even give me a partial refund due to me buying the flights while they were on sale. I could understand I they charged a cancellation fee or only refunded a percentage. But I just cant understand this policy and it is upsetting as it could help me.",1
2019,"Newcastle to Melbourne. I regularly fly this route usually with virgin. I often see this Jetstar flight delayed. This time I chose Jetstar. What a mistake, I was the victim of a 2.15 hr delay because the system was down.  Will never fly this flight again.  No wonder Jetstar gets the ratings it does.",1
2019,"Napier to New Plymouth via Auckland. 2 days in a row my flights were delayed, 1st day for weather which is not their fault (understandable) 2nd day their landing gear jams on arrival at destination so 360 back around to Auckland for another day of delay. I buy a Air Nz flight and straight away get home. On applying for a refund they proved to have a incredibly bad call centre with terrible service and no urgency. Mistake after mistake they have made and now I currently have $14 of my $160 refunded into my account 14 days down the track? 3hrs of phone calls so far. Honestly not wasting my time with this company ever again.",1
2019,"The flight was unfortunately delayed and T4 at Melbourne Airport is not particularly well designed to put it mildly. Still it was an enjoyable flight. The staff were friendly and well organised, given it was a full flight and the pre booked meal was quite tasty .as well. Overall, fine for a budget flight.",0
2019,"Melbourne to Cairns . Wouldn't give me a plastic bag for my 3 year old's 3kg travel pram so I could cover the ""troublesome wheels"". I asked at the gate and in the plane for help. Ticket collector said ""It's either you take the flight or the pram."" Now I'm carrying my girl in Japa. Meanwhile, the couple in front of us got on with five bags. Flight 944 Melbourne to Cairns 29th March. $350 pram thrown in the trash somewhere by the lovely Jetstar staff. And this was hours after they cancelled our 8.30am flight, forcing us to catch the 6am and wake up at 3.45am.",1
2019,Cairns  to Gold coast. One of the worst airlines Ive flown ! I had two boarding passes and 14kgs luggage. They still charged me an extra $60 and wanted my baggage to go in check-in luggage. I couldnt believe how they could do this. Whilst complaining they didnt want to listen and just wanted to do what they want. Id pay that extra fee next time to fly with virgin Australia.,1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. Jetstar has to be one the worst airlines I have come across. The service is appalling, the staff are curt and very unhelpful. We were charged $120 for a few kilos over the 15kg limit. I appreciate it is our fault that our bags were too heavy but what airline only offers a 15 or 40kg weight limit. It clearly is a money making scheme. I wouldnt mind if their service was efficient and ran on time but now after spending $120 our flight is now delayed. I will go out of my way to make sure I never fly with this airline again.",1
2019,"Brisbane to Sydney. I felt I am been ripped off by Jetstar this morning. I have been taking my daily trip with a carry bag for more than 10 years. First time this morning Jetstar decides to weight my carry bag this morning. The weight was 7.1 kg + 1 kg for my iPad. Then the staff decide it is more than 7kg and charged me 60 dollars. I said I could just wear another jeans from the bad and they could consider. The answer was no. I said iPad I can carry on my hand, they said that is part of the carry bag. Holly shit, is this how they start doing business and look after their customers. Guys, be careful, the cheap price is not real anymore. Worst experience ever.",1
2019,"Jetstar is by far the worst experience Ive ever had with an airline and I fly alot! Anything from service, communication and front desk staff are the worst! My flight home from Sydney to Melbourne was cancelled and I received no communication! Got to the airport only to find out the flight was cancelled. Front desk staff helped in putting me to a much later flight which would land in Avalon! I had to wait 3 hours at the airport and she had the audacity to say Im rude. I am furious to say the least. There is nothing that says quality about Jetstar. This definitely will be the last flight I ever have with Jetstar. They are not worth the cheap price I paid for. Pay more for Virgin and get all the quality service that you spend your money on. Jetstar is absolutely rubbish! I wouldnt recommend anyone to fly with them.",1
2019,The Jetstar terminal is definitely the least enjoyable and supplied. Onboard I picked a front row seat hoping to enjoy the extra quietness that is supposed to come with the privilege of a front row seat however this never happened because despite having brought my own headphones and entertainment all I could hear was the lead cabin crew persons personal chatter even through what was already quite loud jet whine. This was a morning flight and I think it was the second of the day but the whole cabin seemed to smell of the toilet. My seat pocket although stocked was torn on one side. Made me wonder how much attention the cabin crew pays to presentation probably not much.,1
2019,"Auckland to Melbourne. After a system shutdown we had to wait almost 3 hours to check in and drop the luggage off. The flight before us got canceled. We were able to check in at the same time that our plane would have departed so we actually started 60 minutes late. The flight was 4 hours long and we didnt get a single drop of (free) water. You had to buy everything. When I landed in Melbourne (still 45 minutes late) I went to pick up my suitcase. It wasnt there. I spoke to the women at the lost counter and it turned out my bag was still in Auckland. Its been 48 hours now and i just received my bag. I didnt hear anything all day yesterday and I couldnt find any updates on the internet. So I called them almost 10 times over the last two days. I had to take care that I get my suitcase back even tho it wasnt my fault it got lost in the first place. Finally the women told me it arrived in Melbourne (after 24 hours) and its ready to get delivered to my apartment (after more than 40 hours). Then i didnt get a call that the courier arrived, I waited the whole day near the apartment. Instead I got an email telling me I had missed the courier and I had to pick it up myself from the airport. I called again. and luckily the courier was so nice to go back and deliver it.  Never flying with JetStar again. Wasnt worth the 144$ I paid.",1
2019,"Cairns to Sydney. I booked a roundtrip flight from Sydney to Cairns through Expedia and found a lot of options. The cheapest was one way on Virgin Australia and the return flight was on Jetstar. I read the reviews but was seduced by the price. Check in was fine. Paid extra for the checked luggage, fine. Got to the airport 2 hours before departure and just as I arrive, I get a text that my flight has been cancelled and I've been rebooked for the morning! What?! Who does that 2 hours before departure?! I ran to the Virgin Australia counter and managed to get on a flight back to Sydney at twice the price. Jetstar refunded my ticket (or at least they say they have) but wouldn't pay for the difference in price of the ticket I had to buy so I could leave. They had offered to reimburse up to $150 for a hotel, but wouldn't give me that money to use towards the new air ticket I had to buy due to their cancelation! So now I'm out about $130 USD. Should've booked RT on Virgin. Or anyone but Jetstar. Never again. Don't think it won't happen to you, it happened to me.",1
2019,Sydney to Adelaide with Jetstar Airways. Will never fly them again! At 8am they cancelled their 3.30pm service to Adelaide and they said all the other flights are full. For a technical reason they should be able to put on another aircraft. I missed out on attending a very important that night! Ill use Virgin in future.,1
2019,"Sydney to Melbourne. My parents: 67 and 64 year old, my step-father having difficulties walking had the worst  experience on the way back from Sydney. First, their flight was delayed (I have e-mail proof of that). Second, at the airport Jetstar changed flight to the initial time without informing waiting passengers (delay was for 3 hours. My parents wandered off from the gate to have something to eat as my step-father has diabetes). Then, Jetstar called them to tell them they missed their flight. Jetstar demanded proof that flight was delayed. Apparently, my parents were supposed to take photos of screens.  From this moment everything went from bad to worse: Customer Service at Sydney were rude and did not help my parents a lot. When my step-dad got agitated, the Jetstar lady at the gate threatened to keep them stranded. Eventually, my parents were put on a very late flight and diverted to Avalon Airport. I will not put them on JetStar flight ever again.",1
2019,Sunshine Coast to Sydney. So disappointed. Cancelled flight and wouldnt refund the money. Very unhelpful staff and wouldnt even help us out with transferring to Brisbane or an earlier date. I hope to never have to fly with this awful mob again.,1
2019,"Gold Coast to Sydney. No value for money and time of customers. My flight was scheduled for departure 45 minutes ago. Half an hour ago, it was announced that the flight will leave in 30 mins. We are still waiting at the gate due to engineering trouble. This is not the first time Im experiencing this from this airlines. Unhappy with the service.",1
2019,"Auckland to Christchurch. To say our overseas guests are unimpressed is putting it mildly. After getting up at 4.40am to catch our flight in order to pick up our prebooked vehicle, we discovered the flight had been cancelled due to 'mechanical problems'. Jetstar has to have the most unreliable fleet of planes ever - constant cancellations due to this. Yeah right. On trying to rebook, the ""customer service"" agent refused to put us on an earlier flight as we had 'agreed to the terms and conditions of Jetstar'.",1
2019,"Darwin to Sydney. They advertise a competitive price and then gouge you with exorbitant fees at the check-in counter. They know you have no choice but to pay their fees at the counter otherwise you forfeit your flight and your holiday/business plans. The 7kg limit includes your carry on. People travelling interstate are not on a day trip and would realistically need to take more than 7kgs. A seasoned traveller would be aware of this trick but for the unsuspecting infrequent traveller's. I will avoid Jetstar in the future at all costs. My inward flight with Virgin and the same luggage was the complete opposite, such a positive experience from beginning to end.",1
2019,"Unfortunately another Jetstar disaster. Often our major complaint is the the poor customer service, the lack of service and the grossly rude staff. This trip however was Jetstar's worst example of service to date. With my elderly mother in-law traveling with us we requested assistance as she suffers from MS. In Melbourne we were convinced to use a buggy instead of a wheelchair. As many of you know there is a lengthy corridor to the gates so assistance was required, she cannot walk more than a couple of hundred metres without stopping for an extended period. By the time we reached the service area after security there was a sign stating they were closed. No buggy, no wheelchair and an elderly passenger pushing herself to the gate down that long corridor. Once in Tasmania, her legs and knees swelled so badly we could not walk anywhere at all. Our days were spent sightseeing from a car, evenings at home, no outings, no dinner and no shopping because what little energy and strength she had was used to walk to and from the house and car. We cancelled dinner reservations, wine tasting and MONA. As a family we know how to manage her condition, all of this inflammation in her legs was a direct result of her Friday walk and when we tried to explain this Jetstar staff were dismissive and naturally did not want to accept responsibility. On our return we were overweight with our carry-on only baggage. We are only to assume we were overweight on our way to Tasmania given that at absolutely no point did anyone check our bags in Melbourne or weigh them so we assumed we were fine. Owning this mistake we unhappily paid the exorbitant $60 fee to check an 11-12kg bag. At this time we discussed that nobody checked our bags at check in at the counter, nobody asked if Anjutta required assistance, nobody did their job yet again but had the nerve to cripple us on check in at the gate. We have no problem folllowing rules, process and guidelines as this is very familiar territory for us however all we ask for Jetstar is that you ensure your business upholds the quality, consistency and values it preaches. It is simply another example of your poor service and more importantly your lack of consistency from airport to airport. This is a training issue and an onboarding issue, you cannot run a successful business unless your employees are being taught and upheld to the highest standards. You have failed repeatedly in our eyes. We have flown with you several times and we will have to revisit our trust in you.",1
2019,"My elderly mother was to have traveled from Auckland to Melbourne last night 3/3/19. For some reason she ended up at the wrong departure lounge and subsequently missed her flight. She did not have her phone with her and did not hear the airline paging her so she sat and waited. My sister received a call from Jetstar asking if our mother had gone through customs/security. We were shocked and extremely worried for her safety and whereabouts. I made a call to the Auckland Airport and spoke to a lovely staff who was professional and empathetic in our conversation. I was put through to another very helpful lass  at Jetstar. With staff out looking, she was eventually located. Story ends. Jetstar offered our mother dinner, provided her with accommodation and put her on the same flight the very next evening. Thank you so very much to all those involved. You've restored my faith in human kindness.",0
2019,"Horrible experience with Jetstar Airways from Sydney to Cairns. The staff were also extremely rude. The airline was trying to charge ridiculous fees for carry-on luggage to make up for their cheap flight ticket. I live in the US and usually have no problem bringing a carry-on onboard. But I was stopped at the gate because they said that my lugguge was over 7kg. I was willing to pay the additional fee just to board with my lugguge since I have an international flight the next day. But they gave zero sympathy and said I can only board without my luggage, which will be delivered the next day at some unknown time. They ended up cancelling my ticket with zero compensation/sympathy/solution whatsoever because I needed my lugguge for the next international flight. Ridiculous because this is just a standard carry-on luggage and can definitely fit on the plane!",1
2019,"The experience my partner had on Friday night with Jetstar was appalling! Im working in Melbourne so my partner and my 15 month old daughter travelled from Sydney to Melbourne to meet me for the weekend. When he went to check in the gentleman that served him advised him that our Nano travel pram was ok to take on the flight. When he went to the gate to board, the 3pm flight was delayed to 3.45pm, then 4.20pm and again to 4.45pm. When he finally went to board after 5.45pm- yes another delay! The staff were rude, unhelpful and wouldnt let him board with the travel pram because it wasnt in a bag! Mind you our daughters sleeping had been planned around the 3pm departure so she was well and truly fed up by this stage and crying in my partners arms while they adamantly would not let him on without the pram in a bag. They had absolutely no empathy that he was a father traveling alone with a baby, and when he asked what options he had they simply gave him nothing! The rule was the rule! He already had worries about traveling alone with her and your staff did everything in their sad power to worsen the concerns! He was willing to dump the $400 pram to get on the flight but even still they had an issue with that! Its absolutely disgusting and appalling service! Thank fully he walked away from the gate, called me for advice and we had another option through Sydney airport staff! He ended up getting the flight to Melbourne and my 15 month old daughter was exhausted. They arrived after 8pm vs the originally proposed 4.30pm! My partner flew home with virgin and had a brilliant pain free experience, Jetstar- you really need to change the approach your staff have in situations where they should show empathy and compassion especially when you expect your flyers to be ok with a longer than 3 hour delay! Its disgusting and I will always choose any other airline rather than Jetstar.",1
2019,For my flight they were checking our carry on bags just before the aircraft entrance and asking for $60 because mine were more than 7 combined with laptop bag. I have made sure my carry on bag is no more than 7 kilos but if it is to combined with my laptop bag then my laptop itself weighs nore than 3 kilos. I work for the airports and travel a lot but never seen any airlines find so cheeky way to get the money. I am shocked!,1
2019,"Melbourne to Bangkok. Check in staff - ridiculously rude, power trip and on the offensive. Checked in as normal no issues, all pretty easy - then whilst walking to the gate remembered I had checked in my medication in my luggage - I had already gone through Passport control so I had to wait for a Jetstar staff to come get me. I am a nervous flyer and find it really uncomfortable unless I can take something to fly. (It is Dr prescribed medication). Was approached by a Jetstar lady, didn't even say hello, just looked at me and said ""what is the problem with a stern face"" ""another winging customer"" I said to her ""hello""she gave me nothing, any way she escorted me back through the gates, there was still 90 mins before the flight was to leave. I went to the Jetstar service desk, carrying my carry on and motorbike helmet. I walked up to a guy to explain my situation, before I could even finish he just started talking over the top of me and said - I cannot take my motorbike helmet on and the bag I am carrying is over 7 kilos. I stated to him, how do you know its over 7 kilos? I was not aggressive but he could tell I was upset. I stated to him can I please get my meds out of my bag so i can fly, he stated and by this time i was surrounded by about 5 Jetstar staff - that it may not be possible and i may have to miss the flight if i was to get it? I stated I cannot fly with out it  he said  regardless of that you cannot take that helmet on board. He grabbed my ticket and saw that i was business, he then stated that I could take it on board but told ground staff to weigh it! No apology no nothing - Absolute power trip this guy was on and horrendous culture for other staff to be surrounding me. I decided to fly with out my meds,  I was extremely nervous I spoke with the co pilot on the flight who was awesome, the cabin crew were great as usual - Jetstar ground staff are rude, arrogant and unhelpful. I fly back from Bangkok on the 5th of March, it will be interesting to see the check in process. Row 2 in business, when the person infront reclines there is more room in an Economy seat.",1
2019,"Sydney to Denpasar. I have just had the worst experience ever on a Jetstar flight! Yesterday I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Bali around 5:45 pm. Firstly, I got a message from Jetstar about delay for 2,5 hours due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Then after arriving to the airport for 2,5 hours later as was said we had to wait for another hour to be seated. When all passengers were finally seated the pilot announced that there is a small problem regarding air conditioner and we needed to wait for technicians to fix it. 1 h later the pilot apologised again and announced that the problem was almost fixed and we were expecting to depart soonish. After 1 hour more which was in total 2 hours of waiting on a plane we were informed that we werent able to depart that day and were asked to leave the aircraft. Then the lady on a check in desk advised calling helpline to figure out what my next steps are. So I immediately contacted Jetstar and after chatting with a staff member of the helpline the nearest available flight which they could provide was in 4 days after my actual one which means that I am going to lose 5 days of my holidays! I understand that technical issues can happen but to not accommodate and suggest a flight that would arrive 5 days later is ludicrous! You have effectively ruined more then half of my holiday. I had to buy another ticket through another airline and also requested a refund for my canceled flight because there was no point of flying 4 days later. However, customer service said that they would not reimburse for my accommodation and transport (for the extra incurred directly arising from jetstars failure). I will never ever fly through Jetstar airline again. Yes they have lower price in comparison to Qantas for example but its not worth it. Indeed I paid for another expensive ticket to get to my destination as soon as possible losing 400$ in total for transport and accommodation and the most importantly my holiday time. I would strongly recommend staying away from this company. It is just a nightmare dealing with them!",1
2019,"Nelson to Auckland. Jetstar canceled the flight four hours before takeoff. Next available flight was next day, 31 hours after scheduled flight. Made the trip impossible for me and I opted to cancel flight. Refund given after 15 days. Thanks for holding my money, Jetstar. I urge people to think twice, at least, before booking Jetstar.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Sydney. They are absolutely terrible. Customer service is horrible. Staff at Melbourne airport are rude and cold. Jetstar has cheap flights but it excludes basic add-ons like luggage, seats, even food, that by the time you finish booking, its the same amount or even more that you wouldve paid for other airlines. That is total rip off. You cannot buy extra luggage over 40kg. If you exceed your carryon bag by 0.1kg alone, you get charged $60 at the gate. They dont tell you this amount at the time of booking. Its all so ridiculous.",1
2019,"Bangkok to Melbourne. Was delayed 2 hours before they cancelled our flight at 11:50 for ""mechanical issues"" and was told our flight will be two days later! At first they said they would accommodate us in hotels but by the time we got to immigration any kind of assistance went out the window. It was an absolute chaos of confused people and of course trying to find accommodation for the next day was almost impossible because it was after midnight. The lack of care and any professionalism left many of us angry, frustrated and stressed. We'll have to wait and see if they'll reimbursed for any of our costs but one things for sure is that none of my family will be travelling with Jetstar again, and I'll warn anyone that is planning to fly with them that they most definitely should choose another airline.",1
2019,"Christchurch to Denpasar via Melbourne. My boyfriend and I left early from Christchurch on Feb 14 looking forward to getting to Denpasar for a 10 day trip. We were delayed in Christchurch for a couple of hours because Jetstar did not have the equipment required by the regulations. We paid $80 each to check in one bag each. When we got to Melbourne, we were rushed to our next plane. We had no time to get food as planned and as a result, spent a lot on food to Denpasar. When we got to Denpasar at around 1 pm local time, our bags did not come off. We waited in the long line at baggage services and were told they had no idea where our luggage was. We were given a PIR number and sent on our way. We have no clothes or toiletries. There absolutely no inquiry about how this would affect our plans or how they could help us. It has been a day and still they have no idea where our luggage is. Jetstar is very difficult to get ahold of and really not helpful. The customer service has been awful so far. We are stuck in a foreign country with none of our belongings and no timeline. I would expect that the airline would contact us (not the other way around), and apologize and give us information at least, compensation for at best. If they were going to rush us to the other flight in Melbourne because of their delay, they should have been honest and told us they would not also be sending our luggage- then we would not have gotten on. It is an awful way to treat people.",1
2019,"Jetstar has canceled both the flights (Melbourne to Bali return) and both the time it was an engineering issue. They asked me to stay in the same hotel where i was staying in Bali and said that the  amount will be paid by Jetstar. When I went to claim that money, then they say there is a limitation of $150 per day and said sorry for the miscommunication.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Bangkok. Very disappointed in the service that I have received from Jetstar. After checking in my suitcases, l was advised that the brand new pram & portacot for my 6 mth old needed to be taken to oversized luggage check in. Flight details JQ17 3:20pm 12/02/2019. l did this, however l noticed that when the female staff member asked for my boarding pass, she then ripped off our labels, that I had printed out when my other luggage was checked, and stuck on different labels. This only occurred as a problem to me, when all my other luggage arrived at our destination and there was no portacot or pram! Jetstar have been contacted and all they can say is that they have no idea where it is! I have had to chase up Jetstar and Melbourne airport where I cannot get a definitive answer! Jetstar have been very unhelpful and dont give a damn! Stuck with an infant in a foreign country with no portacot and no pram has proven to be very difficult thus far!",1
2019,"Flew Jetstar Airways from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. Terrible delays! Will never recommend! We received multiple messages of delays within hours. Our flight kept getting pushed back hour after hour. We had reservations for a pick up in Hanoi and a hotel we had to cancel because of this! Terrible airline, never flying again.",1
2019,"Sydney to Brisbane. This is a budget airline so I wasnt expecting bells and whistles. My flight was cancelled but I was put up overnight in a very pleasant hotel called The Branksome. We had a delicious buffet which was Indian curry. When I checked in the morning my workplace still went on without me and my business still exists. My customers understood these things happen. Given the choice of a maintenance issue with an aircraft and a cancelled flight with overnight accommodation and dinner provided, I will take the second option every time.  No complaints here.",0
2019,Launceston to Sydney. Our flight was delayed over 24 hours. There were open seats on other flights but the airline would not release our baggage. The reason given was that they did not have adequate ground staff to unload the baggage from the plane. We just went over 12 hours from the last update on status of the flight When I asked if there was a manager to whom we could provide feedback the answer was no When trying to submit a claim for direct costs associated with the flight we spent over an hour trying to upload receipts but each time the customer service agent terminated the session before the claim could be submitted There is no email address to send a claim to. No phone number to call. No form that one can complete with a claim This was our first trip to Australia. We had paid a significant amount to have two nights in Sydney. Instead we will have 8 hrs from 11pm to 7am to see the City. This airline is a disgrace. I have never experienced this lack of communication or customer service Do us all a favor.,1
2019,"Was due to fly Jetstar business class from Melbourne to Denpasar. Received text overnight indicating flight was cancelled. Live chat gave me 2 options: a flight via Singapore with Qantas later that day or wait another 1.5 days for a Qantas direct flight. I chose the first option and was assured that as I had booked JQ business class, I would be transferred to Qantas business class. Of course when I arrived at the airport I discovered I was in QF economy. I again contacted Jetstar live chat, who confirmed I should be in business class but could do no more to help me. A walk to the international Jetstar counter showed it to be closed. My 5.5hr direct flight became a 13hr epic. I am facing the same situation now in trying to get home. Customer service is non-existent - they use bots for direct messaging and facebook comments from the Filipino staff repeat the same information over and over. Not possible to get through to call centre either. Never again.",1
2019,"Honolulu to Sydney. Worst airline experience I've ever had, and I fly a lot. The savings will not be worth it, pay more and book with another airline. I never write reviews but my experience with Jetstar has been so unbelievably bad, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. They sold me a ticket and never delivered on the flight. They told me to buy my own place to stay in Hawaii for two nights while they tried to find a plane that could actually fly. Mind you, this was in perfect weather, the cancelation was because of ""Engineering requirements"" whatever that means. They never reimbursed me for the non existent fight, nor the room in Hawaii they told me to book, at the last minute. When I called to try to get my money back they treated me as if I did something wrong, like I missed the flight or something. They were incredibly rude when it was entirely their fault.  I asked to speak to a manager, I was denied, I asked for my money back, I was denied.",1
2019,Ridiculous terms and conditions. It was going to cost me more to change my booking than to completely cancel and rebook. I've been bitten twice with this joke of an airline and I will not be using them ever again.,1
2019,"Melbourne to Gold Coast. They charge the most outrageous amount for a carry-on handbag when you have to pay the bag charge at the gate, 60 dollar for a few kilos. You have to be extremely alert on the weight of your carry-on bag. They advertise with low fares but if you add all the baggage charges and the extra charges at the gate when you have made a mistake with your carry-on bag they are not at all cheap, but quite expensive, this is it how a low cost airline should be, they misuse the rules of baggage weight as they know that people can make mistakes with their baggage weight and the overcharge you without having any options to correct this online. Never again flying with them.",1
2019,"Auckland to Sydney. Cheap airline but if you have any problems youll pay for choosing this airline. I had damage and delayed luggage, the compensation is very low and so bureaucratic that it costs more to have legally signed paperwork than what the company gives. I can only imagine this is done to reduce claims to almost zero, Ive had issues in the past with airlines and never had this level of problems. Even correspondence thats 10 working days for each reply. Ive given in trying to claim money and learn from my mistake, the biggest on this occasion been flying with Jetstar in the first place. I can guarantee it will never happen again which is a shame because the airplane staff are the only asset this company has.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Hi Chi Minh city. Worst airline service. Delayed 8 hours on our first flight of the holiday and only told about the delay via text message a couple of hours before. Delayed due to incoming plane available, how could they have not organised this earlier. Told to contact Jetstar for options which we did and none was given. Staff completely rude and stating they cannot help at all. We lost much time on our holiday and money from travel expenses and accomodation. Jetstar advise that they would not mind if this happened to them and we should be ok with it because they are a budget airline and we saved money. We do not create their business model or prices and picked this airline because of the flight time being the most suitable. Advised that flight times are not part of the contract and they can actually take you when suits them. I would never fly this airline again. We are at the airport now at HCMC and again, received message that our flight back is now delayed as well. This organisation does one thing and cannot do it right. To top it off we have never been on a plane that has had smaller seats. The service, seats and quality is just shocking.",1
2019,Sunshine Coast to Sydney. The ground staff were like bloodhounds checking the weight of cabin baggage. One passengers combined luggage (inclusive of her handbag) was one kg over the allowed 7 kgs. This cost her $60! I think it is a money-making racket. As far as many of the passengers on board were concerned this is a PR disaster for Jetstar,1
2019,"Auckland to Melbourne. I don't think I've ever been on time with a Jetstar flight. There is always something that has caused them to have a delay. Its just how much you are delayed by each time. The $30 I have saved by going with this airline is not worth it. This flight was a late night flight which will cause me to arrive in the early early AM. Very seriously do not recommend, none of my friends or family fly with them for the same reasons now. They were rated the most on time airline at one point. Did they do their own ratings or something, because that must be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.",1
2019,"Do not fly Jetstar! Round trip Melbourne to Densapar, Bali were riddled with poor customer service, cancellations, no communication (it would take me too long to write all the problems I encountered including being put on the wrong flight). I understand the overnight return flight I was on is cancelled regularly. Our cancellation was due to 'safety' concerns so purchaser beware. If this is happening regularly you have to wonder what is happening to their fleet. It cost me $500 to return home to Canada because of their delays and cancellations. I had to bump other flights. They have turned down my request for compensation.",1
2019,"Melbourne to Denpasar. Delays, cancellations, then more delays. Terrible service in the air and on the ground. Disorganized teams that were so accustomed to unhappy travelers, that they barely paid attention to our concerns. As a very experienced traveler, this was the worst experience I have endured. The first and last time I will fly Jetstar",1
2019,"Singapore to Perth via Bali. JQ117 leaves Singapore at 5.20am and arrives Perth 12.30pm, with a 50min stop in Bali on the way. On this trip this A320 aircraft was 1 of 3 versions and had more legroom because the seat pocket was above the tray table. Other Jetstar flights I've flown domestically and internationally, my knees hit the seat in front due to the layout and lower seat pockets, so i was very pleased with legroom, however the seats are lacking some serious padding and if the seat behind you puts something in the seat pocket and closes their tray table, the object pokes you in the back. We were lucky to get row 4 and I was actually seated next to a Jetstar employee who was hitching a ride back to Perth after working the same trip in reverse the previous day. The 1st leg I unsuccessfully tried to sleep for the 1st 30mins as we had been in transit at Changi airport for about 9hrs. I then struck up conversation with the Jetstar employee the next 1.5hrs went quickly with conversation and soon we descended for landing. On arrival at Bali all passengers had to disembark with all luggage etc, even though the same aircraft was our aircraft continuing to Perth and our seats were exactly the same.. this is probably the most poorly organised part of the trip. We disembarked at gate 9b, the last and furthest gate of the terminal. The transit lounge, as we followed signage on and on is at the other end of the terminal, where our tickets and passports were checked again, then security check again, where we lost our water bottles again (you learn to travel with empty bottles because every time you go through security you lose it). The metal detector was so sensitive, the only metal my wife was wearing was her wedding bands and it still set off the sensor and she gad to be scanned manually. Meanwhile all this walking and lines for checks takes up quite a bit of time, so by the time we were through ( and remembering we were in the front of the the aircraft so we disembarked fairly quickly), they started final boarding call for our flight. We checked the monitors - go to gate 9b, looking down the long terminal we couldn't even see N o9 so we started our brisk walk, 3 kids in tow. At about 1/2 way 1 child needed a toilet stop so three kept going and I waited, hearing again the final boarding call. We basically jogged the next 4 gates thinking we would muss it. On arrival at the gate my flustered wife and 2 kids were waiting, unable to board because I had all the tickets and passports. Anyway, another line up for another security check, this time full open all bag checks? Thos that somehow found time to buy water, lost them again, I was down to my last empty bottle. Finally boarded to find my Jetstar friend still beside me and hadn't had to disembark, they couldn't believe we had all just had to go the full length of the airport twice and 2 more security checks to get back on the same aircraft,  by this time my wife and I were pretty annoyed. We had to wait a while for all passengers to board, the last passengers being 3 quite elderly people who were also very flustered and short of breath, i felt sorry that they to had to walk that marathon. I was told i could refill my water on the aircraft, I asked several times but never got it. I asked for one with my pre-purchased meal but was told I could only get coffee or tea, was never offered to purchase one? Poor customer service. Overall not a great experience and it deminded me why I rarely fly Jestar.",1
2019,"Denpasar to Melbourne. Absolutely shocking experience, first time flying with Jetstar and will be the last. A cancelled flight leaving Melbourne, told there were engineering requirements. Not offered any apology or anything to make leaving easier - paid for a direct flight and was only offered flights with long stopovers. Once in Bali, hours before we were due to leave Jetstar cancelled our flight, again stating engineering requirements. A day later, again hours before we were due to leave Jetstar cancelled the flight, the 3rd flight in 2 weeks. Jetstar have been hopeless over the phone, it takes hours to get any result. They do not offer their customers anything to make the travel easier after the inconvenience they cause - still wanting to charge $4 for water or $20 for a blanket when finally on the plane! Would not waste my time or money on Jetstar again - they are so unrealiable!",1
2019,"Jetstar cancelled my flight at less than 12 hours notice. They refunded the ticket as they were unable to get me on a flight within 3 days and I needed to be in Perth (for a wedding, which I will now miss). They refused to extend any goodwill beyond the flight refund - no assistance with a hotel in Singapore, even though it's not my home base and even though their email said they would compensate. Confirming this with the idiotic robot customer service staff they said indeed they would not pay for hotel. So now I'm stranded in a city I don't live in, with nowhere to sleep this evening.",1
2019,"Queenstown to Sydney. After waiting almost an hour and a half to check our bags with extremely snippy and rude staff, we then were rudely herded like cattle onto the plane itself. There's no food or drink, not even a peanut or pretzel. The level of service, or lack there of, is appalling. And of course, they charge for every little possible thing. Not worth it, pay the $100 more for a smoother and easier trip on another airline.",1
2019,"Gold Coast to Sydney. You may find yourself waiting 2 hours for a 1h15 flight. no compensation, no apologies. I was going through Sydney to catch a flight back to London and instead of having an ample 2 hours time in Sydney to comute from domestic to international terminal, I found myself throwing money at a taxi driver just to make it to the check-in of my flight to Europe 5 minutes before the close. That's what it is to be a client. The reason was the plane was grounded for part of the day for engineering work. And I don't think any effort was made to provide another plane. Cherry on the cake, in Gold Coast airport, no assistance was available. there was no Jetstar staff inside security and to talk to them, I had to exit, walk to their counter, have them tell me i was going to miss my on-going flight and there was nothing they could do for me, then go back through security. 3 times. No Jet, no star. Happy Australia Day.",1
2019,"Adelaide to Melbourne. Very disappointed in the service staff at both gate and service desk. After reaching the gate and having my carry on luggage weighed and being over by 3kg, I was told I would need to go and check it in for $60. Back out of the departure lounge I go, passing the security I just waited 20 minutes to go through and to the service desk where I would recite that my carry on baggage is over the designated amount and that I have been told to have it put under the plane. The staff member on the service desk re-weighs my bag and tells me that it doesn't need to go under the plane, I just need to pay $30 for an extra baggage allowance, which I do, and then he puts a tag on my mini suitcase and handbag and we proceed back towards the even larger cue at the security check. At this point I'm a little bit annoyed that I had to walk out and re do this process just to be told that my bag doesn't need to go under the plane, however, I was the one who went over the weight limit so I don't mind. After getting back to the terminal where my plane is boarding I am singled out by the staff member who originally told me I needed to go pay extra to have my bag put under the plane. I tell him that I have just been out to the service desk and already had my baggage sorted. He said no, grabbed my bag from me and put it on the scales. Said that it needed to go under the plane and started telling me callously that he told me this already and that it's my fault- I would have to pay an additional $60 and have it checked in. It had been a long morning and after being sent here and there I was emotional (my anxiety caving in around me) and against my best efforts, started crying. This elicited no sympathy, only a defensive manner of tone from the staff member. I tried telling him again that I had followed his instructions which led me to the service desk who then told me otherwise. Thank God my boyfriend was there to help communicate because I was a mess. The lady who processed the payment was helpful and caring,  in the end instead of charging me $60 on top of the recently paid $30 she only made me pay the difference. It was the lack of communication and knowledge of policy by staff members as a whole, and the rudeness and belittling nature encountered by one staff member in particular that has made me decide I will not be flying with this airline again nor will I be recommending it. They may be cheap flights but you get what you pay for.",1
2019,"Adelaide to Sydney. They canceled my flight because they didnt have enough staff, the link they provided in the e-mail didnt work, I called and I was on the line for over an hour an no one picked up (that was after couple of minutes of dealing with AI). There was a flight after my canceled flight but because if that it was booked fully, I called as a new customer and they picked up the phone immediately, they didnt provide any good solutions I asked for refund so I can go back with another airline but of course no refund, so I didnt make it back for my business and missed a lot of thing, I will never travel with Jetstar again.",1
2019,Auckland to Honolulu via Sydney. Auckland checkin people helped with an issue with my flights (ended up with two ref numbers) so the issue was to correct them so my luggage transferred (both routes where with Jetstar). Auckland to Sydney went well with no issues. The next flight I didnt have food booked and it was difficult to find someone to fill my water bottle on the flight. In Honolulu my luggage was missing and its been almost impossible to speak to anyone from customer services. My delayed luggage was reported and since Im flying onward to an area not covered by Jetstar I was told it would be to expensive for them to forward my luggage that their lost (so Im starting to think Ill never see that again).,1
2019,"Singapore to Phuket. The trip went smooth, on time in both ends, friendly staff both in Singapore and onboard the plane. Very positive experience. We do not expect that, when it comes to LCC.",0
2019,"Osaka to Cairns. Firstly I have to say that having the entertainment system blankets and drinking water as an option for an additional charge appears to be a really bad service since long range flights over 4h are expected to include those features in the price. Flying from KIX to CNS on a Boeing 787 was just another less than average service. Having pre-booked the entertainment package ($10) and a meal($10) to make sure that this flight remains a chance to be somewhat 'okay' still turned out as not being enough. My screen was frozen about 1:10h after starting to watch a movie. After it automatically rebooted, the system asked me to pay for the use of the entertainment system, so I contacted a crew member and asked if they could fix that issue. Even during the remaining 5+ hours they weren't able to make it work - wasted money (rip-off). Second flight, same day, CNS-BNE, A320: Pre-purchased a meal when I booked that flight and expected to have it served before other customers who still have to pay for whatever they order on the plane. This wasn't the case either. Instead it took that long, that landing was only 30 minutes away on a 2h flight.",1
2019,"The worst flight experience ever. Jetstar cancelled our flight when we waiting at the boarding gate at Melbourne Airport. The reason is engineering problem of the airplane. At first, as the the flight departure is quite close to the departure time and still havent received any announcement about the flight until the last minute.

2019,"Perth to Melbourne. The filthiest plane I have ever been on. The seats weren't even brushed for crumbs and sand.

2019,"Christchurch to Auckland. Worst airline every step of the way. Perpetually understaffed. I ended up paying $150 for an extra bag even though I had already paid, already flown one leg with it, and showed a receipt for the payment. Also, their extra bag fee is $60, not $150 that I was charged. The staff spent so much time figuring out what to do with my receipt that was not in their system, that I was about to miss the flight, gave up, and paid any number just to depart and make my connection. And after all that they damaged my fragile cargo, which I fly with all over the world and no other airline has ever had a problem handling. Fly the competitor, trust me.",1
2019,"Honolulu to Sydney. I do not like Jetstar at all. Ive been flying for years and years now and they are the only airline Ive experienced that does not offer complementary drinks and weighs your personal bag and carry on.  Also the inflight entertainment cost money so I had nothing to do for my 10 hour flight. Every other airline Ive been on, if they have it, it has been complementary. The flight attendants returning home were extremely rude when I politely asked for a cup of water! I will not be flying with Jetstar again in the future.",1
2019,Sydney to Melbourne. If you want to make it anywhere on time or have life dependent on getting anywhere then don't use Jetstar. Absolute joke. Flight delayed from 4pm to 6pm no explanation why. Missed my meeting which was well timed 3 hours after my flight was suppose to land. Why have a departure time if you cant meet it. Def will spend the extra money next time and go Virgin cause can't rely on Jetstar. If I could give less then 0/10 i would.,1
2019,"Sydney to Gold Coast. My flight has been cancelled at last moment due to weather, it is understandable. But after waiting at airport counter, they were not able to give another flight for next 4 days. And offered Qantas voucher with life time validity. Then after a week, I received a Jetstar voucher with only 6 month validity. I am not a regular domestic traveler , so it is same as no refund.",1
2019,Christchurch to Melbourne. I bought 40 kg per person of luggage only to get to the airport and be told we do not honor your ticket. If you dont pay you can't get on this plane. So had to pay $575 so we could get on the plane. After 10 minutes we were called back to the counter and told we made a mistake but we will keep your money for 15 working days. As they took the money just before Christmas i wont get the money until end of January and that stinks. Never will i fly Jetstar again never been treated so bade. The worst service ever.,1
2019,"My Daughter travelled to Melbourne with Jetstar. She tried unsuccessfully numerous times to check in online. It constantly came up with either an error or time out message. We decided that we would explain it at the airport and at worst be charged a small extra fee. They were not only not helpful but rude and charged her $160 for one checked bag! We ended up paying as they would offer no alternative. My daughter arrived at the airport excited and looking forward to her trip but left check in in tears from the rude service. I contacted Jetstar by web chat (you can't speak to them). They were equally unhelpful. They asked if we took a screen shot. we didn't as we had no idea this would turn into what it did. The ticket was booked on Kayak.com and there was no mention of these crazy fees. Even on the Jetstar site, it was very hard to find. They offered a $50 voucher. No use for someone living in Seattle! It would have been far cheaper to pay the extra for a Qantas flight. I used to think US airlines were bad. They have been out done! I recommend anyone looking to book in Australia to add up the real cost and try a different airline.",1
2019,"Phuket to Sydney. Very bad customer service, cabin crew not attentive at all. Everything on the flight was overpriced. I paid $4 for the coffee which didn't have any taste. The price for the food and meals is expensive, no wonder no one was ordering the food or drink. On the flight only credit card was excepted as a method of payment. Even though airplane was new and cleaned, the flight was very shaky and there was a lot of turbulence.",1
2019,Jetstar Airways cancelled my flight from Sydney to Brisbane. Very poor communication but as the return flight is with Jetstar they refused to give me a refund or airline credits.

I hope the service is better. Very disappointed.,1
2018,"Queenstown to Hobart via Melbourne. I'm writing this after experiencing some of the most horrific, embarrassing, despicable customer service I've  encountered. My initial itinerary had me flying to Melbourne to meet friends, then transferring to Tasmania for my final destination. Jetstar canceled my Queenstown to Melbourne flight because of engineering problems in the plane. I then waited in the airport for 4 hours to be booked on a new flight. The Jetstar service agent gave me two options, and said I could proceed with both, and just needed to select one option by midnight. I could book a new flight on Air New Zealand to Melbourne, get reimbursed for the Jetstar flight to Melbourne and at the same time get a reservation on a flight through Brisbane on Jetstar. She said I could tentatively keep both options open so long as I informed Jetstar which I'd like to select by midnight. The attendants assured  me I would be fully reimbursed for my travel if I booked on an Air New Zealand flight. I got home, decided I'd like to fly with Air New Zealand and cancel the convoluted trip through Brisbane (where I'd have to book last minute accommodations during the holidays which is expensive, challenging, and unnecessary). I called the agents, who informed me they had canceled my flight, and that they could not reimburse me or change it back. They explained the reason was because the airport staff failed to make a note on my booking about the agreement they offered me, that I had an option for a refund. After explaining the situation numerous times, I was told I had no alternative, no option for a refund, and stuck with the travel to Brisbane, even though this would mean out of pocket expenses of several hundred dollars with no reimbursement, along with entirely missing my entire Melbourne experience. This is absurd and some of the most terrible customer service I have ever encountered in my life.",1
2018,"Hobart to Melbourne. This was a very smooth flight. Check-in was fast and efficient, as was boarding (including checking for overweight cabin baggage). The seat was a little tight, but fine for a short flight. The plane operated on time and the onboard welcome was friendly. Luggage appeared on the carousel in good time. All in all, a pleasant experience.",0
2018,"Sydney to Honolulu. Low fare carrier was the true and honest name they choose for themselves, the carrier truly upholds the word ""Low"" and apply it to all aspects of the experience. Choosing the seats, you pay to choose the seat fair enough, however how can you assign a six year old a seat 3 rows away from her parents?? we were all allocated seats in row 50E,F,G,H and J but my six year old child was in 53B. when I spoke to the officer checking us in he said ""it is done and that is that"" and refused to talk to us! When we boarded we were strictly instructed to take our assigned seats until take off, so my daughter would sit by herself during take off,  mind you she was in the middle seat between 2 strangers. after the doors closed i noticed 4 vacant seats at the back of the plane, so i went to the crew member and asked if i can move to these seats, ""NO"" was the answer, when i asked why, they said because these seats are allocated for the crew to rest during the flights. They could see my daughter in distress, but their seats were far more important than the feelings of a six year old. I tried to make a complaint, and the process is a lot of fun not. They get you to chat to someone and these people are more robot like than humans, they were only trained to use the right language and legal terms that would not get the airlines in trouble but have no EQ what so ever. Finally i was offered 50 dollars voucher and a further 25 dollars for each of us  ""this is not a compensation but it is a good will gesture for your experience"" that was repeated more than 6 times in the chat. They refused to give me a case number so i do not complain to the ACA. This was actually coming on the back of another ""wonderful experience"" with Jetstar, on the way there they lost my luggage. Ii contacted them and was given a case number, six days later i have not heard from them, i went to the airport in a desperate attempt to find my luggage, i went to the office asked them and they said, ""yes it has been sitting here for 6 days"" I asked why has no one contacted me? no answer? but as soon as i got back to the hotel, I found an email telling me that my luggage, which i had just picked up was found and ready for collection.",1
2018,Sydney to Ayers Rock. Filthy. I travel all over the planet with a backpack and small bag. Never have I had to pay $60 to bring them. Unbelievable scam. I'll never fly with them again.,1
2018,"Cairns to Sydney. Definitely not recommendable! Unfriendly Staff and we had to pay 60 AUD for 2 Kilo over the weight. You can only carry with only one bag, even a laptop case is not allowed. We couldnt take our coffee for take away with us in the plane. In total we had a really bad flight experience.",1
2018,"Adelaide to Sydney. Absolutely awful service. We had booked two flights, one to Sydney and the other back to Adelaide. Both services being cancelled! Not only were they both cancelled but they didnt attempt to get us on any other flights to our destination and they only told us that our flight was cancelled an hour before we intended to leave for our flight BOTH TIMES ! Most unreliable airline company there is, I would definitely not recommend.",1
2018,Brisbane to Sydney. I am very happy with the treatment from Jetstar. We had a 2 hour delay at the airport. The ground staff were very patient and kind to the disheveled passengers they encountered. They gave myself and 2 daughter's $200.00 travel vouchers each and a food vouchers. Luckily the delay wasn't such an inconvenience to us but I know other people on that flight had time schedules. I was more than pleased and give Jetstar a good rap all the time.,0
2018,"Melbourne to Cairns, flight was delayed by 1 hours.  Staff was terrible and rude, staff on flight JQ944 told us to stop our daughter - she was just playing with my husband and walking between his seat to mine. We told her that we are telling but its hard if we force her she will cry and people sleeping on plane. Instead she told us that she is a mother and know how to control kids and she questioned our parenting and she did it twice.",1
2018,Perth to Denpasar. Have travelled with on previous occasions but this was different. Started with being charged $400+ AUD one way then $100.00 AUD for 6 kg excess baggage and then the issue of the lady at counter laughing at me in front of other customers at check in. When asked what was amusing just continued. Was not funny at time as found charge to be excessive. Not professional either. The new seats not bad but still no room for the extra paid. All round not happy. Why is it so expensive to leave Australia but to get back is 1/3 of the price. Getting ripped off maybe.,1
2018,"Melbourne to Sydney. What can I say, as usual departed late, waited for collecting my bags till 6:30. The plane was supposed to leave at 4:15. Very disappointed. Needed to be at my daughter's school for Xmas carols and didn't make it. One will hope Jetstar will keep it up during the holidays but no. Hit and miss, business as usual.",1
2018,"Sydney to Honolulu. In short: Cheap flight that is not worth a penny. Ridiculous baggage restrictions with unreasonable extra costs, poor customer service, no complimentary drinks or snacks, no included meals for a 9 hr flight, and no in-flight entertainment. Jetstar ruined Christmas and was a terrible start to our holidays. My husband and I have been living abroad for a year now and we were really hoping to make it home for Christmas to see our families. Jetstar had a great price for flights, so we told our families we would be able to afford Christmas at home with them so long as they knew that we wouldn't be able to afford additional Christmas gifts. We each had 1 hiking backpack (to their low expectation of 30lbs per check-bag - which is 50lbs with every other airline), each had 2 small backpacks as a carry-on, and packed 2 suitcases of things we decided to fly home with us as we had accumulated quite a few things while living there on a Working Holiday Visa. We packed up a full suitcase filled with Australian treats - enough to fill a stocking for each of our siblings as well as our parents to thank each of them for hosting us while we were home for the holidays. I had prepaid for check-baggage prior to the flight - only to realize that the bags were limited to 30lbs, and that I wasn't able to purchase additional baggage (I assumed I'd be able to purchase these 2 additional bags once we arrived at the airport). I assumed wrong. We arrived at the airport with our pre-weighed carry-on backpacks and our 30lb check bags. I planned to pay the same steep rate of $115 per additional check-bag (of only 30lbs and not the regular 50lbs) once we got there, though while checking in, we were told that was not an option and that we would need to pay $25 per kg. We were quoted a total of $1300 for our additional bags. We paid $1400 ($700 each) for our flights, $230 for our pre-paid luggage, and then would have paid $1300 dollars extra to get 2 suitcases home - both at 50lbs. More than our flights! We stepped aside and sorted through our luggage to decide what we were able to bring home. We narrowed our bags down to 1 suitcase and packed it to 20 kilos. We were charged an additional $500 for 1 suitcase  to fly back home. A whole suitcase of Christmas gifts had to be thrown out as we could not afford to take it home to our families. We found a security guard, asked him if he had kids, and said Merry Christmas. I wish it had ended there. The lady checking us in couldn't put our payment through as her computer wasn't working. When she finally got us checked in, her payment terminal wasn't functioning. Once the payment was put through, we had to move over to someone else that then printed our boarding passes for us. She also told us that they weren't going to be able to get us a seat together -  the best part is that the plane was half empty - and the lady sitting a couple of rows up from us got to lay on the 4 seats in the middle on her own because her ankle was sore and she wanted to put her feet up. They didn't have complimentary drinks, no complimentary snacks, or meals for a 9 hr flight. On top of that, your only option for entertainment was to pay a $10 fee for in-flight entertainment as they didn't have any movies to show on the plane - and they couldn't even make the effort to get us a seat beside each other with half of the plane empty.",1
2018,Auckland to Wellington on JQ255. We were informed that our flight is now delayed for two hours without any prior notification. It happened about 30 minutes before we were supposed to board. No compensation or food vouchers were offered. I cant say that their staff was helpful. There was another flight to Wellington departing at the time of our delay but we were not offered an option to catch it. Delays look like a regular thing with Jetstar.  I wont recommend them if you on a tight schedule.,1
2018,"Singapore to Melbourne. Flight to Melbourne got cancelled one hour before plane was due to fly. We were in queue for more than 2 hours for the service desk before another passenger told us that we could call in to re-booked. Staff on the call was unsure of process, gave differing advice and had to put me on hold several times to check the refund process for hotel stay. In the end i was re-booked on another flight one day later. No compensation was given at all. I had to forfeit my hotel stay and airport transfer that I missed in Melbourne. Will not fly with Jetstar next time.",1
2018,"Our Flight to Phuket was cancelled 3.5 hours before the departure time. Jetstar then took 2 days to get us to our destination via Singapore (we only booked with Jetstar because it was direct). Things didn't get much better when we got on a flight we were delayed on another flight and neither gate staff or cabin crew gave us any information or an apology. We lost two days accommodation in Phuket and Jetstar refused to compensate us for any of our out of pocket expenses. After spending an hour on the phone talking to Customer Support (mainly being put on hold) they told us to chat online to a support agent, also a waste of time. We had water taken off us before boarding the aircraft then cabin crew sold small bottles of water for $4. The whole experience was terrible.and Jetstar lived up to it reputation as the World worst airline in 2017.",1
2018,"Very poor, service help desk assistance. I was about to travel in JQ35 (terminal 2) from Melbourne to Bali on dec7. It is very exhausting moment to see not even single staff handling the service desk before 1 hour of departure. I couldn't catch my flight even though 50 minutes left for departure without check in baggage. I missed following other 3 connecting flights. Also online check-in options wasn't given. Just by providing cheap flights alone, doesn't make your airline the most likable. You need to provide smart assistance.",1
2018,Queenstown to Auckland. Incompetent support person. I was misinformed on a booking which cost me an addition booking with extra booking fee and waste of my time over phone. What a terrible company. My advise - if there is not much difference please fly in AirNZ. At least you get good service and money won't go overseas.,1
2018,"Sydney to Gold Coast. Due to sandstorm in November 2018, more than 40 flights have been cancelled. My boyfriend had to go with an another airline in GC for a big Pacific tournement. Unfortunately they delayed our friday night flight to sunday flight at Sunday. It was too late for the tournament. So we went to Jetstar counter and asking if they had a flight before sunday morning. The man said 'we have a flight at 6'. We buy it directly in cash $821 for a one way only. He printed the boarding pass and on the path, we saw boarding time was at sunday 6pm not 6am. My boyfriend has directly saw the man, who said 'I told you it was 6pm not am'. As they were a huge queue, we decided to line up and wait for our turn. After 20 minutes of waiting, it was almost our turn, the man left its office and a women replaces him. We explained her our story and asked for a sooner flight. She said that this is impossible, all flights are booked. So we asked for a refund. She said that they don't make refunds, only credit voucher. As we are french, I explained that there were a misunderstanding, that we bought flights less than an hour, the money is still in the cash register, the cash is our holidays budget. So she went to see the man and her manager. After few minutes, she came back and confirm us that we can't be refund and there is no credit voucher either because the tickets are not refundable. So we lost $821, we didn't take the plane. They could take advantage of this situation and could propose these tickets for other people. Since the airport was full of people which their flights have been cancelled too. The salesman were not helpful at all, not comprehensive, mostly that we are french and it was a communication mistake. We will never fly with them.",1
2018,Queenstown to Melbourne. Jetstar reason for cancelling our flight is they had to divert and refuel in Wellington. From Queenstown. From there they told us to get our own accommodation at 950pm in Queenstown and offered only $150 refund for 1 room - which would not cover the cost. They also emailed us a refund form to fill out and fax back - are you kidding me. Its the 21st century who uses fax! I had long term parking which they don't cover the cost for and then they delayed our rescheduled flight the next day! At 12pm! And offered us 1 meal voucher! 1! Absolutely appalling. They don't care about you - do not fly with them.,1
2018,"Phuket to Sydney. Poor airline, its not all that much cheaper. I chose to fly with them as they are an Australian company, you have to pay for all your services that are normally included on all other long haul flights, even baggage! The main problem flying with these guys after all those extra costs is delayed flights, Ive flown 2 international flights and 1 domestic and all have them had been delayed. So disappointing",1
2018,Auckland to Melbourne. Flight delayed to the next day without any reason given. This company obviously don't understand the meaning of customer service. Unprofessional and direspectful for their customers. Last time travelling with them. RATING 0/10,1
2018,"Singapore to Bali. I chose to travel with Jetstar Airways because of their promo priced at SGD130 for return, I usually pay sgd250-280 to garuda (as I have flexi schedule so travel any day is not a problem for me) with baggage allowance of 30kg and onboard meals, so I thought Iit wise for me to try Jetstar Airways out this time since I travel light. But this prove me wrong as they asked to weigh my bag at the self check in kiosks including my laptop bag and total allowance is only 7kg, how can this be possible? Even Scoot which is also one of the budget airline allowed 10kg cabin excluding laptop bag, I wonder how can they include the laptop bag to a total of 7kg allowance, I don't think anyone would be able to get thru this if you travel with a small cabin bag plus laptop, as laptop itself is normally 3kg and plus an empty cabin bag is 2kg, so unless you bring nothing in the cabin bag, else for sure you will need to buy a checkin bag on last minute which will cost you SGD60 which is half of the price of the airfare and not to add in the return baggage as well which will almost close to the price I pay to Garuda which is not a budget airline! So why should I still travel with Jetstar Airways in the future -totally pointless! First time encountered this with a budget airline and I will never travel with them again and won't bother to care about their promo caused this should not be the way for them to conduct business to suck their customer money like this and I feel is not ethical to use this way to lure your customer by promo but suck their money by forcing as in fact all of us caught by surprise and have no choice to pay.",1
2018,"Bali to Sydney. Got told an hour before that flight was cancelled. Offered no help when managing booking via phone or online. Got to the airport, crowds of people standing around, unsure of what to do because there wasnt any staff to assist. Very stressful and upsetting. Would rather assurance over cheap flights.",1
2018,"Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh via Singapore. Check in at Melbourne our luggage was weighed including my laptop and found to be over the 7 kg about 1.8kg My spouse had her luggage weighed together with her bag and found to exceed the 7 kg allowed by 1.1 kg. According to airline rules we had to pay extra for this. However, the attitude of the 2 female staff at the kiosk was quite insulting. My spouse asked how much will be the charge each for the whole trip, charge was A$91.82 per person for 15 kg each, which we paid. My wife particularly asked if this charge and weight was for each and for the whole trip and the answer was in the affirmative. On departure from SG to Vietnam we were told my spouse had to pay extra because it was JetStar Asia, not Jetstar Intl and they said Jetstar Asia had nothing to do with Jetstar Intl. Luckily my spouse had now only 6.6 kg luggage and she opted to take the luggage to cabin. I paid for 15 kg $91.82, my spouse paid for 15 kg 91.82 (we have receipts).  As said pay cheap get nasty surprises. Never again Jetstar.",1
2018,"Denpasar to Melbourne. The flight left and arrived pretty much on time. Our family sat in rows 11 and 12 (row 13 does not have windows). The seats were comfortable, but if I fly longhaul again with Jetstar I will bring my own pillow as I couldn't get comfortable to sleep. The crew were Asian (Thai),  were friendly enough and did their job. We didn't bother with meals as the flight left at 11:15pm and arrived at 6:40am and they had the dame dinner options for breakfast. By the time we fought through immigration at MEL, our bags were waiting on the carousel. There were 4 complaints which put me off Jetstar: We had our luggage and hand luggage searched / screened twice by Airport officials, but Jetstar had their staff search people's hand luggage for 'liquids' before allowing passengers into the gate. What they were really doing was taking people's duty free alcohol that they had bought in the airport.  When I was considering purchasing meals for breakfast, I was unable to select the second (breakfast) service. Breakfast options were the same as dinner - why not put on some breakfast options. I will likely fly with Jetstar shorthaul at some stage, (I will give preference to Qantas / Virgin) but for 3hrs + I will stick to a full service airline in the future. You do need to purchase your luggage, entertainment and meals. I would recommend doing this when you book your ticket to save money. We booked more luggage than we ended up needing at a reasonable price. I would recommend choosing seats in the front sections in rows 11 and 12. If you want water on the flight don't stress - bring your water bottle and the crew will fill it for you free as you need it during the flight.",0
2018,"Auckland to Nelson. Have heard bad things about them, but it was ok for me. I usualy fly Air New Zealand on the AKL-NSN route but I saw a Jetstar ad and opted to fly with them for $150pp return which is cheap because air nz charge up to $150pp one way!  I chose the early 6:05 am flight which meant waking up at 4 am. Arrived late to the airport and we could not find the gate (62) because at Auckland it is a small building separate from the main domestic terminal and was poorly labelled. the aircraft was remotely parked we had to get on a single small, crowded and sweaty bus to the aircraft. Boarding was a mess, a mad rush to get on the plane. upon entry the flight attendant did not check our boarding passes?, I had an e-ticket. we were met by a strong wet dog-like musty odour inside the cabin. The seats were 'well used' and had no guts left, the tray tables were marked and scuffed but lots of legroom, my overhead panel was not working. but all this is to be expected from a 15.5-year-old aircraft. during the safety briefing the flight attendant apologised and said this was the aircraft's first flight of the day so the pilots would be performing engine tests. After a quick takeoff, the pilot anounced that due to 'airspace restrictions' we were going to fly out over the Pacific ocean and loop back into Nelson. the rest of the flight was uneventful no free cabin service though, final was turbulent, the landing was slightly rough. The new terminal at Nelson tops it all off nicely.",0
2018,"Flew Manila to Tokyo. Jetstar Airways, the most inconsiderate airline I have experienced, Ive been flying a lot every year in the last 20 years both personal and job related and the ground crew in Tokyo are the rudest and most inconsiderate crew I have ever dealt with. I wil never fly with this airline again.",1
2018,"I was flying from Melbourne to Tokyo via Cairns last month with Jetstar and it went fairly well. Unfortunately upon landing into Cairns we were told that our connecting flight on to Tokyo had been cancelled due to a bird strike on the aircraft. I must say the ground staff at Cairns handled the cancelled flight really well and professionally and I was pretty impressed. I was accomodated onto the next flight for Japan, which was within two hours, and was even able to get a coffee and cake at the cafe inside while I was waiting. The only problem was I had to go to Osaka airport instead of Tokyo (I've lived in Japan for over two years so I at least knew what I was in for) The problem I did have though was when I tried to claim the unexpected costs of transferring back to Tokyo once I arrived. I chatted to staff online and they were brilliant, very understanding and professional the entire time. Even when I had to explain the situation a few times to different people. Once I had a manager assigned to my case it was resolved within a few days. I was really impressed with how the situation was resolved with minimal fuss. I believe the IM function on the website is an excellent addition to their customer service toolbox and made contacting them while overseas really painless. I am really impressed with the level of customer service I recieved from everyone throughout the journey and helping with my issues. I would definitely recommend travelling internationally with them again. The flight itselft was great, the new Boeing 787 that operate the Australia to Japan routes are amazing, quite spacious (I'm 187cm tall), comfy and clean.",0
2018,"Brisbane to Melbourne. Horrible quality airline with no food and low quality everything, which would be ok, but at the airport and gate you will be harshly checked and overcharged for everything - I just paid $60 for less than 1 kg overweight together with everything. Cheap, if its sharks like Jetstar, cost me at the end more expensive than nice quality Qantas.",1
2018,"Booked with Jetstar 3 days before my flight. Received no email with confirmations or anything, no itinerary no nothing. Checked again later and still nothing. On the day I had to buy new flights with Air NZ because I couldn't confirm I had a booking with Jetstar. Called for a refund and spoke to a potato of a human that had no idea he was at work, no refund, no English, no service.",1
2018,"Sydney to Auckland. No online checkin for our flight. My wife and I have been traveling internationally for a week. We are departing Sydney to New Zealand and the ticket agent tells us we have no baggage allowance and we will have to pay $350+ for one checked bag (15 kilos) plus excess for carry on bags. My wife and I spend 40+ minutes frantically spreading things around, wearing a couple of layers of clothes and throwing away gifts for our kids. We then go to another person to pay or excess fees and are told we dont have to pay it and our ticket includes one bag for each passenger at 23 kilos each. By this time our checked bag is gone so we cant add anything back in, my wife is in tears and Im mad as heck. We have no recourse as we are heading back to the US. The only thing the ticket agents offered was a food voucher. Not even an upgrade to an exit row seat for gosh sakes! Im highly disappointed and unfortunately this airline has ruined what had to this point been a great visit to Australia. This airline is worse than Spirit Airlines in the US.",1
2018,"Bali to Melbourne. I booked my flights to and from Bali with Jetstar. Both directions my partner and I were forced to sit seperately. After speaking on the phone and in person, I was denied to change seats so that we were able to be together. I am a terrible flyer and was in tears at the airport for an hour before our flight. Will never fly again, and would definitely not recommend.",1
2018,"Melbourne to Adelaide. When you book with Jetstar, please think twice! I booked my return flights with Jetstar to Adelaide early with a special price of $104 return. Thought I got a good deal. Have my travel planned and organised. As travel date coming near, they send me an email cancelling my flights giving me limited options of other flight or refund. This happens twice already. In order to arrive on time for a wedding, we have to refund and book last minute with Virgin at over $170 just one way. Everybody, I would rather book earlier with an airline that is reliable than being put in such position of being ripped off, getting a ticket last minute. After I witness this ""sudden cancelling"" situation twice within the past 4 months, I never recommend anyone to book with Jetstar, since their ""so called"" promotional deals is cloud without rain, giving promise of the gift they doesn't realise.",1
2018,"First time Jetstar flyer, was not aware of such a strict carry-on baggage weight limit. Flight from Cairns to Sydney was delayed in departure, and scales were brought out in a rush. I was first in line. Agent said I had to pay $60 fee for excess carry-on. Thinking we were boarding immediately, I had no choice but to pay $60. However, the flight still didnt go due to aircraft malfunction. Subsequently, a 3.5 hour delay and a new aircraft. In the interim, I unloaded items from my bag bringing the weight down to 7 kg or less. Thought bags would be re-weighed when a flight was rescheduled and I would be entitled to a refund. Rush again to board the delayed flight at another gate. Bags were not weighed for that flight. I asked agent for a refund of my $60 cash because I was boarding the aircraft with less than 7 kg. She said contact Customer Service upon arrival in Sydney. The kiosk was unstaffed in Sydney. Emailed Customer Service and was told no refund was possible. I asked for different compensation such as an upgrade or meal voucher for my next flight 3 days later. Not possible, they said, because it was a separate booking. Totally unwilling to mitigate the circumstances, even when the flight was 3.5 hours late departing Cairns, and even though my carry-on luggage was not in excess of 7 kg upon departure. Bum deal, JetStar. You will never again have my business.",1
2018,"Jetstar cancelled my 10am then 1pm flights, then tried to throw me on the 21.30. I called to rebook for the following day and they said if I change again I'll be charged! Seems it's okay for them to muck you around but if you can't fit in then they bill you.",1
2018,"Melbourne to Sydney. The flight was cancelled and Jetstars refund terms limit your ability to make other options. The return flight was not until the next afternoon, costing me a days work. I paid for premium seating but the staff member sitting next to me got the window seat and felt like playing loud YouTube clips without earphones. I was told a refund would be possible but following up a week later they said because I took the flight home no refund (even partial for the inconvenience) was possible.",1
2018,Constant delays as we have experienced yet again can only mean that either the maintenance being performed on these aircraft are substandard or the operational side of the airline is substandard. Four hours late arriving for a wedding in Denpasar Bali though part of this issue was not caused by Jetstar. And now we are sitting in the airport in Bali waiting to leave and a minimum five hour delay though they are telling us to prepare for a longer delay. No airline should be allowed to operate with these constant engineering and or mechanical delays.,1
2018,"Given our recent experience with Jetstar, this airline doesn't deserve a rating (can you give a negative score?), it was shocking. Our flight from Uluru was scheduled to depart at 12.55. Before leaving our hotel we received a text saying flight departure changed to 15.00. On arrival at the airport, advised departure now 17.30. (Given a $7 voucher for our inconvenience). Further announcement, departure now expected to be 18.30 (given another $7 voucher). By this time the only cafe at the airport had run out of all food. Later advised flight expected to depart 19.30. Plane arrived around 19.30, by the time we got airborne it was 20.15 approx. Got to my house in Melbourne around midnight instead of 4.30pm. No apologies offered by Flight Captain or Aircrew. (Our flight to Uluru from Melbourne was also delayed 3 hours).",1
2018,"Jakarta to Singapore, 9 Oct 2918 the Jetstar Airways flight QF5204 was delayed for about 50 minutes due to computer problems. We finally departed Jakarta at about 4:00 pm local time and when we arrived Singapore, it already almost at 7:00 pm Singapore time. The crew didn't inform passengers at all about how we are going to catch our connecting flight to Sydney with 7:30 departure schedule. We were just instructed to go directly to Gate D46 from the arrival at Gate C24. It was quite far. My wife with her back problems and knee weakness have to follow me to run as quickly as we could. When we arrived at Gate D46 it was already closed. We were instructed to go to the transfer desk to take another flight which is QF2. It's good that we still have another flight. But why the crew with QF5204 didn't tell us about this once we exit the plane on Gate C24?  It was really a outright ignorant of Qantas. Even after I wrote the same complain in their website, till now I haven't received any response.",1
2018,"Brisbane to Cairns. I have flown Qantas many times and expected their sister airline to have some of the same polish and class but on that score it failed. The process used to check in could not have been more confusing and frustrating. I was over weight on baggage and the process to purchase additional kilos required visiting not one but two additional desks and then waiting in line again to check the baggage. Why does it have to be so complex? Could this airline do anything more to make a passenger feel like an object without value? The flight itself was uneventful and comfortable enough but after the difficulties checking in and paying for additional baggage (the fees were excessive and made this anything but a ""budget"" flight), I was frustrated, angered and felt entirely disrespected by the airline. I will try my best to avoid Jetstar in the future.",1
2018,"Melbourne to Sydney. Jetstar is by far the worst airline that I have ever flown with. Extremely unprofessional and rude ground staff, long delays, very bad organisation, dirty planes. Dont ever waste your time and money flying with this airline.",1
2018,"Very below par airline! They cancelled my flight that was booked from Cairns to Melbourne on Sept 27th 2018. Wouldn't refund me and wouldn't change my flights without having to pay ""the change flight fee"" As I am a mad Westcoast Eagles supporter who had tickets to the AFL grand final that weekend and to the footy show for that night. The flight was cancelled in that morning, there was no way I was going to miss out. I was then forced to book a new flight that day with Tiger airways. At a cost of $400!! I tried everything and was on the phone for an extensive amount of time. All I asked was for at least a refund as I had to rebook another flight. Will never fly with Jetstar again! Very disappointing from a very below par airline.",1
2018,"Melbourne to Sydney. Horrible, rude customer service. I've flown budget airlines in India, US and Europe. Nowhere are the airline employees as rude as this airline. They let some customers through with 1 or 2 kgs extra weight ahead of me in my line. Saw an Indian passport and made it a point to reduce the weight to 10kgs, not a gram more. This was given the fact that I was carrying 10 lithium polymer battery is weighing 6 kgs which I had no option to check in. Avoid this airline at all costs.",1
2018,Cairns to Sydney. The ground staff of Jetstar was extremely rude and unprofessional. Poor manners and attitudes. Submitted complaint to Customer Care Team did not reply. Followed up with Live Chat. Not helpful at all. They just tried to brush you off. Obviously they don't care.,1
2018,"The flight was on time as was the return trip. Cant complain with the airline. The only issue I had was the legroom in economy as I am over 6 foot, but its pretty much the same for every airline these days. No IFE so you have to bring your own or a book like I did. Any food or drink purchases are by card only, so beware they don't take cash. All in all I got what I paid for knowing its a budget airline (I paid extra for baggage and to choose my seat) and would fly them again.",0
2018,I travelled on Jetstar JQ174 from Christchurch to Melbourne. I was able to check in three hours before departure at 6pm at the automated machines. Unfortunately Customs & Immigration was closed until 7:30pm. Missed the business lounge and had to make do with Burger King. On boarding I was the first person to board as they called the back of the aircraft first and a was seated next to the gate. Had a spare seat between my next passenger. The flight overall was good.,0
2018,I travelled on JQ524 Jetstar from Melbourne to Sydney on 19th August. I was given and exit row when I checked in on the automated machines. We were a little delayed into Sydney as they could only use one runway due to high winds. I always try and fly Jetstar.,0
2018,Travelled from the Gold Coast to Cairns with Jetstar. I love the Gold Coast airport as it is small and you cannot get lost. Had a Burger King breakfast which was nothing special. The flight was uneventful. We had to board via walking across tarmac but that was no problem. I like flying Jetstar whenever I can.,0
2018,"Auckland to Sydney. I had the worst service at the counter, staff tone to me was as of a robot. I was talked down to and disrespected. Will never fly Jetstar again and will refer everyone away from using it",1
2018,"I've made a reservation on Jetstar from SIN-TPE on 11/6/18, 1.10am. 13/9/18  Received email notification from Jetstar on flight delay to 9.55am. Contact Jetstar via live Chat to reconfirm details. Proceed to reschedule all the arrangement, paid penalty for hotel and tour amendments. 17/9/18 Received email reminder for the flight to TPE. Noticed the flight timing indicated as 1.10am (no notification was received on the change of flight timing). Called Jetstar Hotline to reconfirm on flight timing. Call centre was not sure of the timing. Throughout the 30min conversation, the agent told me 3 different timing for my flight and finally confirmed that it is changed back to 1.10am. Again, I proceed to reschedule all the travel arrangement and paid for amendments fees. 18/9/18, 10 hours before the flight, received an SMS notification that flight was delayed to 9.55am. Called hotline again and the 1hr 30min calls was hell. Spoke to 2 different agent and non was sure on the exact timing. First told me it's changed to 9.55am, and next moment tell me there's no change and the flight is at 1.10am. As of now, I am not even sure if the trip will happen as promised. Not sure if it'll suddenly change to 1.10am again and I am not being informed. It's true that the t&c for budget airline mentioned that it's subject to changes, but 3 changes for a flight is too much when there's no natural disaster whatsoever. The call centre advised me that it's simply due to ""operational requirement"". Customer have to suffer because of their changes in ""operational requirement"", Don't ever book Jetstar again!",1
2018,"Melbourne to Sydney. Flying out from Melbourne for family emergency in Sydney. Flight delayed by over 3 hours. Whilst we were told that there are technical issues, no time frames as to resolution. I would've thought the company of this size would have business continuity plan in place for situations like this. Apparently not. As we were waiting to learn our faith that morning, another 4-5 flights have been delayed. As I was getting ready that same night to fly back to Melbourne, I received a message that my flight was cancelled, less than 2 hours before planned departure and was only accommodated the following morning, arriving to Melbourne after 10am. And what did JetStar say on all of that: ""sorry"".",1
2018,"Sydney to Auckland. Jetstar lost our car seat and refused to accept any responsibility. Agent at Sydney airport had horrible customer service and we have yet heard back a response from Jetstar after we filed a complaint. On Aug 25, 2018, we were checking in for our flight JQ201 from Sydney to Auckland when we encountered likely the worse customer service of all of my 20 years of traveling experiences. There was a long waiting line to check in at the counter that morning. First question the agent asked of us was ""which one of you can speak English?"". I thought that was rude. We are Asians in appearance but both my husband and I are physicians from the USA.  As she was printing our boarding passes and luggage tags, she said she could see that we paid for two checked-in bags but she could not locate which passengers they were paid under, therefore she still had to charge us for the two checked in bags. I said I had the receipt for the paid checked-in bags. She looked through the computer again and said she still had to charged me for the two checked in bags. I could not believe it! It does not make any sense. I said I was not going to pay again because she could not find it. It is a form of incompetence. She then said ""I am not going to serve you anymore. You have to go to someone else."" and left me there standing. She did not tell me where to go initially. She was clearly doing that to delay my check-in process as a punishment and aggravates my anxiety as the flight departure time was approaching. I then requested to speak to her supervisor. Her supervisor was better but obviously not well trained for customer service (did not display ability to de-escalate the situation). But she figured out the problem was the car seat. Apparently the agent does not know that. She needs to be trained better but that is the least of her problem. Jetstar lost our car seat on the same flight which we learned about we got to Auckland. No one contacted about our car seat for a few days until we got back to San Francisco, USA. We had to buy a new car seat as a result. We contacted them for reimbursement but they refused.",1
2018,"Gold Coast To Sydney. A delay of 2 hours because of an engineering problem that had no time limit until it was fixed. Once boarding finished, it was a quick getaway to make up some time. Inflight service and IFE was non existent, Jetstar is a LCC. We landed 2 hours late, so no time was made up during the flight time. I would advise anyone flying on LCC to just be cautious if you are on a schedule, otherwise delays happen and you will eventually arrive at your destination.",0
2018,Check in great. On time departure with an almost full aircraft both ways. Hawkes Bay airport are not helpful giving Jetstar a gate way out of the way. Could be much closer to the terminal as Jetstar was the only aircraft on the tarmac. Great service and great price.,0
2018,"Flew Jetstar Airways from Newcastle to Brisbane. Terrible, first flight was delayed 4 hours and they did not contact or notify us at all. Then the return flight was cancelled and again no contact at all. Luckily we thought to ring and check. If I could rate this lower, I would. Never again!",1
2018,"Flew Melbourne to Brisbane. Charged $60 for being 150 grams over their 7kg allowance and had to put up with a rude member of staff tell me that If I dont want to pay I can stay in the airport! I will never fly with them ever again, companies like Jetstar who prey upon their customers and at the same time be so rude need to be sent a loud message!",1
2018,"Brisbane to Sydney. Staff and rude, pushy and aggressive. This airline is cheap and nasty. Planes are uncomfortable and dirty. Although flights arent considerable cheaper than other airlines, they look for ways to charge extra at every point of the trip (baggage weight, food purchases, charity donations). Fly this airline as a last resort.",1
2018,Flew Cairns to the Gold Coast on 31st July on Jetstar. My seat was 1B and I had to agree to help in an emergency. We were delayed and a new aircraft was called into service causing a three hour delay. Overall a great flight.,0
2018,"Christchurch to Gold Coast. This is not a good airline with inconsiderate staff in Christchurch, NZ specifically. Being from the US, I wasn't aware of the fact that even flights between NZ and AU are considered domestic. So, in order to mooch off of the passengers they have this annoying rule of 7kg carry on only. Its unbelievable that the airport treats you like an international passenger but the airlines treat you like a domestic traveler. Their scales obviously are manipulated and they charged me $75 for being over 7kg. I went in winter time so, obviously I had heavier clothing. In their flights, they don't serve anything coz again to save their money, it's a domestic flight. Such unfair practices just to charge international passengers unnecessarily. If customer service is something they cared about they wouldn't be treating us like this.",1
2018,On 9th August I flew from Wellington to Christchurch on Jetstar. It is only a 38 minute flight but it enables one to travel between the two main islands of New Zealand. I checked in online without any trouble. I was offered a snack and water in advance for about 6 dollars but declined as it was such a short flight. I had coffee in the terminal before as I arrived early. Overall a very comfortable flight. Sky bridges were used in both directions as I was seated in in the front of the aircraft in seat 10C.,0
2018,"Adelaide to Sydney. They operate like a full service airline. The cabin is stunning and they provide almost full service throughout the whole journey, only complimentary food was not provided. Ground staff was very friendly. Cabin staff look friendly as well. Safety demonstration was professional. I was really surprised with the experience.",0
2018,"Denpasar to Perth. The flight left on time and the aircraft had recently been refurbished as the seats were clean and everything had a new feel. As JetStar is a low cost carrier, you must buy food and drinks on board (it should be noted that no drinks bought in the airport can be brought onboard the Perth flight as they search you again at the gate). The selection was very good but the prices were quite high for what it was so Id recommend getting snacks before you get onboard. Crew werent overly friendly and seemed quite rushed. The seats only have a pitch of 29 inches which was just adequate for someone over 6 feet tall. I think that on a flight over 3:30 would become uncomfortable in the confined space. The flight landed about 25 minutes late and it took forever to get off the plane. For a low cost airline it was fairly average and next time Id choose other carriers on this route.",1
2018,"Wellington to Dunedin. I've taken a few flights with Jetstar and aftet today I feel it's time to write a review. If you're looking for a reliable airliner, Jetstar is not it. Every single flight with Jetstar this far has either been delayed heavily or cancelled. I've lost hundreds of dollars in accomodation and rental bookings which I'm told won't be refunded. Don't tell me it's bad weather, the weather is clear, what about the sophisticated instruments you have on board? The last time I fly with Jetstar. Just wasted half of my Sunday and then to be told it's cancelled. Staff are confused and uninformed as well. When compared to other airlines I've never had problems.",1
2018,Gold Coast to Auckland. On check in I was offered an exit row which I accepted. Boarding was ordered and not congested. Deplaning was fast. Pre ordered a muffin and coffee as a result of an email from Jetstar one day prior which was delivered the first round of the beverage service. I was just given a chocolate muffin without a choice. No big deal though. Overall it was a great flight. I fly Jetstar whenever possible.,0
2018,Adelaide to Perth. The obsession with carry on baggage weight that includes computer or handbag for a total weight of 7 kilos makes passengers paranoid and uncomfortable just in case they are 1 kilo overweight. This puts unnecessary pressure also on staff. Weighing hand luggage on boarding caused confusion and many customers complain. This is obviously a revenue raiser despite that they are concerned about safety. Get back to reality that's why your ratings are so low. Look at what the best low cost airlines do.,1
2018,"Hong Kong to Hanoi, supposed to be a short 2 hr flight but its already been delayed 2 hrs and its estimated that itll be 3 hours. The worst part is that didnt inform anyone for a very long time so were all waiting around. There wasnt even anyone at the gate desk for over an hr after the delay. Then we get switched gates and the girls that finally show up at the desk are pretty much just on their phones even when you walk up. Pretty much killed a day in my short stay in Hanoi. Wont fly them again.",1
2018,"I bought the Jetstar Airways ticket for this flight from Jakarta to Singapore last minute because I missed Scoot flight because of traffic at Jakarta Int'l airport. The ground staff was nice but boarding was chaotic. The flight itself was ok, adequate service from FAs. The flight arrived on time.",0
2018,"Sydney to Launceston. Such a poor experience with this airline, not only were we waiting in the baggage area for 40 minutes without any explanation but we were then left to go home without our luggage. The lack of communication was pathetic and to not have a replacement piece of equipment to remove baggage from the aircraft once the first failed is just pathetic. Yes they stated that the baggage would be delivered once it was removed from the aircraft within two hours, another fib, poor, very poor!",1
2018,"Cairns to Sydney. I negotiated an exit row seat at checkin and 5 minutes before take off, I was advised that I and the others in my row had to change seats. I asked why and I was told that it is usually due to young families that need to be kept together. I said, no problem, and gathered up my things. As I was about to move to my next seat, which was much less appealing than my original seat, I saw the passengers who I had changed seats for. It was four men, middle aged. who had arrived late, and appeared to have been drinking. Not a young family, but some blokes that wanted to continue drinking together, and obviously had some friends at Jetstar who accommodated them. What a joke! This is not the way to be treat full fare paying passengers and I and my business will not use Jetstar in the future.",1
2018,"Phuket to Melbourne. Ive never had a worse flight experience than what I experienced with Jetstar International. I flew from Melbourne to Phuket first and incurred issues with the staff. The service was absolutely horrible. Not once did staff walk through the cabin to offer water to passengers on a 9 hour flight, nor did they comply with our requests when we asked for water. I had to call staff multiple times over several hours before receiving a small cup of water. I also paid for comfort packs and received them two hours into the flight. The flight back to Melbourne from Phuket was delayed 6.5 hours making me miss my domestic flight back to Adelaide and requiring extra accommodation to be purchased. All the airline gave passengers for this inconvenience was a $20 food voucher when in reality, many, like myself paid $600+ due to their inconvenience. I would not recommend flying Jetstar under any circumstance. Staff do not seem to have any consideration toward passengers and overall service was appalling.",1
2018,"Dont waste your money and time. Jetstar has increasingly become worse each year. We have had four flights cancelled. You end up paying more for accomodation when your flight is cancelled - once after a 12 hour wait, they wanted to send us back home! We had to argue to get a cheap, dirty accomodation organised near the airport. The next time another flight was cancelled and we were offered accomodation and we said, NO. Never trust where they put you. While waiting around at the airport you also spend so much money for food and lose your precious holiday time. Better to spend a little more and secure your holiday and business travels with other reliable airlines. The worst is the staff and clearly their lack of quality training. They have no desire to help you out, inform you promptly and show a compassionate attitude during cancellations. They are slow as turtles on land and couldnt care less about customer care. We have had three flights cancelled due to engineering issues. Their aircrafts are unreliable and the engineers unable to deliver speedy and quality repairs. How can they have so many issues so often?? I feel scared to get on their planes. We will never fly with Jetstar again. Not only are the prices cheap - all other aspects of Jetstar is cheap. Dont waste your money and time.",1
2018,"Adelaide to Perth on the 14th of June with Jetstar Airways. Flew on a relatively new Airbus A320, when compared to some of the older ones in the fleet. Although I was seated close to the front (8D), the seat was unbelievably tight in terms of seat pitch, which is okay for shorter flights like Melbourne/Sydney, but for a longer flight Id try and buy an exit row seat next time! Crew were okay, but nothing to write home about. The customer service manager wasnt overly pleasant when she informed me of my $15 voucher (as Id purchased a Starter Plus fare). I had purchased this fare for the bargain basement price of $99 (plus $45 for the starter plus bundle), so I cant complain too much. It was good value for what Id paid, but there are better airlines around for only a few quid more.",0
2018,"BNE-PPP on the 21st of June. Due to an early check-in, I was treated to an upfront seat (2C) instead of the original 9D I was given. Ground staff in Brisbane were wonderful, and the all-male crew onboard this mid-afternoon flight to Proserpine were terrific! It certainly got my Whitsunday holiday off to a terrific start! Overall, a wonderful flight at a good price! Ive noticed that on shorter hops, Jetstar is much better, but on longer flights (over 2 hours), its better to upgrade to an exit row seat, or fly another airline.",0
2018,"Hobart to Melbourne. Two flights, two issues. First, flight from Hobart to Melbourne cancelled, no notification, no reason given for cancellation. All of my contact info was correct and I was on a local phone system (received texts and email from other people). Next flight was three and a half hours later (it took off much later than that). I asked to be put on another flight as I had a meeting in Melbourne at 5. Jetstar refused because they had a later flight. Offered refund, but I had to eat all the fees, so the full refund was about 60%. booked on a Virgin flight for $200 more, but got there. Second, a policy issue. Flying from Cairns to Hobart via Melbourne. Jetstar will NOT check baggage through. Had to retrieve bags in Melbourne re-check them (and go through security, wait at check-in counter all over again). When I asked an employee why we could not check through he said that they were such a budget airline that they refused to pay for someone to sort the bags as they come out of the plane. He was completely embarrassed by this policy. From a customer standpoint it is tremendously inconvenient. I will never fly with Jetstar again!",1
2018,"Very good flight with Jetstar. Plane was a bit messy though. Food was great, really good cheap travel food on Jetstar. Cabin crew were great and very helpful. Jetstar is the best cheap travel airline by far. Way better then Tigerair or anything like that. At Gold Coast airport it was self check in and bag drop. Although there were a couple of Jetstar people walking around not really doing much. One again, very good flight with Jetstar, but as always, room for improvement!",0
2018,"Melbourne (Tullamarine) to Gold Coast (Coolangatta). Very good flight with Jetstar. By far the best cheap travel airline Ive ever been on. Not really any help at Melbourne. Self check in and the odd couple of Jetstar people walking around. We checked in online so we just bag dropped our bags. A bit of a wait at boarding but I guess thats cheap travel for you. Me and my family had starter plus so $30 (Australian money) on food, drink ect. Legroom a bit little but it was a short flight to be fair. No TVs on the domestic flights but if you fly international with Jetstar youll have TVs. Again, very good flight with Jetstar.",0
2018,Melbourne to Newcastle. My 8pm flight was cancelled without providing sufficient explanation. They refused to give me a flight the following morning. I had to fly into Sydney airport 2.5 hours drive away. This level of service is unacceptable.,1
2018,"Paid for the package including hold baggage, a meal on the flight and the pre-selected seats. We selected the meal online but on the flight we were given a different meal and told ""This is the meal you selected, all passengers with that package get the same meal"". I didn't even try the provided sandwich. I knew I wouldn't like it and it looked terrible. Another in our party tried it and said it was awful. Also tried to upgrade baggage beforehand but the site wouldn't accept either of my bank cards. I believe it was because I was on mobile but they told me their site works on mobile and it was a problem with my card. Two cards failed to work and one notifies me if the payment is declined so I know there was no problem on my side. Luckily, I left the option on as unpaid so wasn't charged extra at the airport. They didn't tell me this was an option while I was on the live chat with them though. An on the subject of the live chat, anything typed into the box, even if you don't press send, is sent to the agent. They only record messages which are ""sent"" which can mean accidental pastes are sent (perhaps a password for example?) and they have no record that their employee received it. Also, if you want a copy of everything said in the chat, you have to speak to a different team. This is basic functionality available in most live chat services. I contacted them with a complaint. The first response was just excuses and the offer of a voucher which can only be used by me and expires in 6 months. I live in the UK so completely useless. I contacted them again and they said they had forward some of my comments on to the development team around the live chat but nothing was said about the meal or voucher. The only positive things I can think of is the we made it to our destination and the ground staff at Sydney were helpful.",1
2018,"Darwin to Sydney. Jetstar does not have self service kiosks in operation at Darwin Airport, however online check in is available up to 1 hr before departure. Check in for domestic flights opens 2 hrs prior to departure and closes 30 mins prior to departure. The flight boarded about 15 mins prior to departure, there were a few unoccupied seats towards the rear of the aircraft and some passengers managed to get three seats to themselves. Prior to take off the captain gave a quick description of the route and the expected weather in Sydney. A quick food and beverage service was offered just after take off, the cabin lights were dimmed shortly after the service finished. The flying time to Sydney was 3 hrs 55 mins.The flight was smooth and most people managed to get some sleep. The flight went into a holding pattern just North of Sydney to wait for the 6am curfew to be lifted at Sydney Airport.",0
2018,"A320-200 Sydney to Darwin.Boarding commenced 25 mins prior to departure and left on time. Information on the flight was provided by the cabin supervisor. Shortly after take off food and beverage for purchase was offered throughout the cabin, snacks were offered - $5 Soft Drinks $4 & Beer starts at $8. The leather seats are comfortable but have a limited seat pitch.The crew were friendly and attentive and dealt with customer requests efficiently.There is no wifi or ports to charge devices on the aircraft which can be frustrating on the longer domestic flights over 3hrs. The flight arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule.",0
2018,"Sydney to Gold Coast Return with Jetstar Airways. The outbound flight was on an older aircraft, seats were less comfortable and more cramped. The Crew on this journey were very cold, not Customer orientated in any way. I understand Jetstar is LCC, but as a business that deals directly with the public you would expect a certain standard plus being part of the Qantas Group should give you an advantage. The return flight was more up to scratch, the cabin was refurbished with a better hard product, and the Crew even remembered that I had a $10 voucher to use onboard. I think the service is very much hit and miss with LCC, my advice is to book with Jetstar for leisure with flexibility in minds, rather then for business.",0
2018,"I have flown Jetstar domestically with usual delay issues but this was my first international flight with them. On May 31st (USA time) our flight from Honolulu-Sydney at 8:30am was cancelled. We have been at the airport since 5:30am, at first they said there's technical issues & flight will be delayed by 1 hour then they turned around and said its cancelled, next flight will be the next morning. After waiting several hrs we were given an $8 voucher for snacks at the airport ($8 can barely buy you a snack) but had to wait couple of hrs at baggage claim for our bags. Then they announced our flight will be at 11:45pm that day. There was no speaker system, everyone had to ask others what they are announcing as we couldn't hear a thing. They told us they are organising us hotels & shuttle buses. There were hundreds of us waiting outside for the shuttle. I decided to uber it to the airport which was just down the road (could have walked there) only to arrive and be told we have to wait til 3pm for checkin. Finally when we got our rooms could only have a few hrs rest before getting a shuttle to another hotel where we got a voucher or dinner. But on arrival there was a long queue of people waiting in line! As if we are not exhausted & over waiting. I left and decided to make my own way to the airport. After checkin & waiting at the gate, it was 11:30pm and boarding hadn't commenced for a 11:45pm flight. By 12:30am we were ready and started leaving, then the plane stopped for a while & they announced we have to return as there is 'another technical difficulty' which was another 1 hr delay. You'd expect after a cancelled flight& wasting our whole Friday that Jetstar would have had all day to do their checks & ensure there are no technical difficulties & plane is 100% safe and functional. Terrible customer service & poor communication. Not even a courtesy meal or drinks on flight to apologise.",1
2018,"My wife and booked to fly to Bali for a relaxing holiday June 7th and returning June 16th with Jetstar. We checked in with Jetstar staff flew to Bali only to be told that we would be sent straight back home as the wife's passport was 2 weeks short of the mandatory 6 months required. Bali airport questioned why this was not picked up by Jetstar staff at the check-in counter. We rang the Australian Embassy who said that we should never been allowed to allowed to leave Australia. When flown back to Australia via Sydney where Jetstar Staff stated that this was their fault we should have picked this up at check-in. Pathetic,  useless staff in Brisbane. Do not fly Jetstar. if you have a problem don't bother calling, you will only get a machine. all they want is your money.",1
2018,"My wife is going Brisbane to Melbourne for a funeral. Gets to the boarding gate an hour early and Jetstar staff are weighing everyone's luggage. My wife's carry on was a kilo or two over limit because she didn't read the fine print and didn't realise that a handbag was included.  Happy to pay a little extra for the couple of kilos overweight. However, $60.00 or couldn't board flight. That's nearly the cost of an entire ticket! Come on Jetstar, I'm sure some of the people behind her in line would have weighed 30kg more than her. Utter joke, made a stressful time for her even more stressful; not to mention embarrassing. Will never fly with them again or recommend to anyone.",1
2018,Honolulu to Bali via Sydney. After being told several time we are leaving in an hour they then at 10 am cancelled the flight and told us to come back same time the next day. We did and it happened all over again. We were told to come back at 10 pm that day to leave. This puts us now delayed 75 hours and on top of that we have to get new connection flight from SYD to DPS putting us at the Sydney airport for 12 more hours. I will never fly Jetstar or Qantas again. Jetstar is owed by Qantas and Qantas had 30 open seats but they said we had to by a new ticket with them and did not offer a discount at all. No help what so ever. Talking about horrible customer service.,1
2018,"Melbourne to Denpasar. For under $400 return i was quite happy with the service, but if i was paying closer to $600-$800 which these flights sometimes are, my review would be quite different. Seat was fairly comfortable, but narrow even for someone like myself who is under 170cm. I paid the $26 extra and sat in the forward cabin. Apart from a screaming child on both legs, it was fairly tame compared to the creche in the main cabin. I think they should make the forward cabin free of parents carrying infants as it is only 3 rows and you could probably squeeze a bit more money out of me for the privilege. For a bit under 6 hours to Bali and 4.5 hours I was fairly comfortable but would struggle I think for anything longer. Overall you pay for what you get and for the price I am satisfied.",0
2018,"Melbourne to Proserpine. Regular traveler on this route. Jetstar provide good value for money. No issues at all with the flight and the Cabin Manager was fantastic and pleasant. The cheese and ham toastie is a winner for breakfast. I fly Jetstar regularly and never have any issues above what I would have with any other airline (e.g. delays etc). The only, small, issue is that they are constantly pushing to buy branded products.",0
2018,"I was flying Melbourne to Gold Coast to join a friend so we can fly to Thailand the day after, and have flown by Jetstar many times, knowing that it is common practice to get some extra baggage and pay for it in advance, and did so this time as you can see.. As I was dropped to airport early had to wait to check my small luggage, 2 hours before, no problem so far. I am walking up and down and up again where you check in and one lady there maybe security, asked if I was ok? I explained that I am waiting to check my bag in, she convinced me that as I have paid for extra baggage I can do it immediately. So I did as to carry it on board, which by the way was not my proffered choice carrying bag with me. So this is where the problem begins I was told that I had to pay extra $60 dollars - obviously I was not happy tried to explain the situation to no avail, what really upset me here the two female staff were so rude never even wanting to listen. I wish someone in  Jetstar will understand this and review your standards and procedures. I flew back to Melbourne with another airline, and may never return to Jetstar, the way I feel now.",1
2018,"So, we had a death in the family recently and in the last 3 days have had to use Jetstar 4 times for the Newcastle - Gold Coast leg. 3 out of 4 ran late, 2 of them significantly late. I'm on the 4pm flight right now, it's 6.40pm and we just had an announcement of a further 20 min delay. We might be taking off soon. Tonight, I must admit, I was at the end of my tether, and I took them to task during boarding. They threatened to remove me from the flight and the girl was very aggressive about it. I gather this is their system for controlling unhappy customers and it worked. I had to back down quickly or risk being stranded far from home with a child. Disgusted and shaken. It's the 23/5 if you want to see your employee in action Jetstar. Or is this your system?",1
2018,"Melbourne to Sydney. My mum and I were booked on a 3:15 pm flight when we received notification that our flight was cancelled. After contacting Jetstar - the cancellation was apparently due to bad weather. Our travel agent booked us on a 6:15 flight in replacement. Having already booked and paid for transport to the airport for a set time, we went in and decided to just wait the additional time. Not only were there several flights with other airlines (virgin, Qantas & tiger) all leaving at 3pm - going to Sydney (they didnt seem to be affected by this bad weather - the bad weather that was non existent !!) but they were all running on time and had no issues flying out. After checking out bags in - we were informed that the flight, was delayed. After a day full of screw ups from Jetstar, arriving home at 10pm - with work the next day, its safe to say, we are both unimpressed.",1
2018,"Gold Coast to Melbourne. This airline knows nothing about customer experience. They weight your luggage at the gate and with only being one kilo over, I was made to pay an additional $60 to check my bag. Considering my actual check luggage was 6kg under, it would be best practice customer service to check in the system and include it in that. I will never be flying Jetstar again.",1
2018,"Will never fly Jetstar again, flights were changed weren't notified we were flying from Perth to Thailand with a stop over in Singapore on way. The flight time was changed we were not notified. Our flight was changed till midnight next night from Perth to Sydney 4hr flight than had wait 8hrs in Sydney than a 9 hr flight to Thailand. Absolute joke worst experience we have had.",1
2018,"We will never fly Jetstar again. Horrible experience and extremely poor customer service. Our flight got cancelled last minute while we were waiting to check in at the airport at noon. They only had a flight next day early morning. We were offered zero compensation, transportation and no accomodation. Staff very careless about it only excuses and stating ""it happens all the time"". It doesn't stop there - next day flight they put on 6.30 am we arrived several hours before and while checking in this was flight delayed again till 9am. Again no notification prior. So we've missed 2 days of our 5 day vacation, no compensation and no proper notifications so we could make other arrangments. Oh and they dont even include a bag for international flight either! (charged $75 for checking in 15kg bag!)  We've lost not only that but all the headache and expense of unrefundable hotels, activities and rental car, all because Jetstar didnt notify us before, cancels and delays flights last minute.",1
2018,"Sydney to Melbourne Avalon. First, the good part. The aircraft was in OK condition, my seat was bearable for a one hour flight, Jetstar got me to my destination on time and my bag arrived on the baggage carousel. But it's very difficult to travel on this airline without thinking that they take every opportunity to shakedown their customers. In the departure lounge, I witnessed people being asked for more money for their carry-on. Thanks to other posters on this site, I knew in advance to check in my bag (which other airlines accept as carry-one without question), so it didn't affect me personally. I had bought a starter-plus bundle, which at the time of purchase was claimed to offer standard seat allocation, a baggage allowance, frequent flyer points, and a snack. When I received the itinerary, there was no mention of the snack. Equally, when I received the boarding pass, there was no mention of the snack, either, but there was a four digit code, so I asked a crew member at checkin what the four digit code was and she replied that it was because I had paid to have my seat allocated in advance (seat allocation is part of the starter-plus bundle). When the cabin crew were promoting the sale of snacks and drinks, they said that they would accept Mastercard, Visa, or American Express, but they said nothing about people who had bought the starter-plus bundle. When the crew member serving snacks got to my seat, I showed her the boarding pass and asked her if it entitled me to a snack. Yes, she said, your choice up to $10. Why don't they print this on the boarding pass and announce it when about to serve snacks? I nearly went without  I thought I must have got the wrong idea about what was included in the starter-plus bundle. I can't help but get the feeling the airline wanted me (and other starter-plus customers) to forget the fact that the bundle includes a snack. No doubt it's more profitable if people pay for a second time, or go without, as I nearly did. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth but, like the shakedown in the departure gate, seems typical of this airline, which only seems to care about opportunities for more money.",1
2018,"Jetstar Airways has the worst customer service. All of my dosmetic flights have caused me so many issues. I am currently stuck in the Queensland airport, delayed for over 2hrs because Melbourne is currently foggy. However, Tiger and Virgin are flying just fine to Melbourne. Even Jetstars earlier flight to Melbourne is currently boarding. Dont give such poor excuses and expect customers to be forgiving. Were not that stupid so believe this problems. Should be ashamed Jetstar.",1
2018,"Cairns to Tokyo. Upon checkin in Cairns I was asked to show an onward ticket which I did not have and was refused the check in. I have travelled a few times to Japan with other airlines and this has never happened. I know the rules, which are 'may refuse'. The rule is meant to avoid suspicious people to get to the destination, be refused entry and sent back, apparently at the airline's expense. This rule is flawed because, upon arrival, the traveler's ticket will not be for that day, it may be up to 3 months in the future. Internet tickets are generally not allowed to be changed or cancelled. But if a ticket can be cancelled (such as 1st class tickets), then the traveller can cancel it straight after checkin anyway. The Jetstar personnel was unsympathetic to the extent of malicious and could have caused me to lose not only my $700 flight, plus the other inconveniences with missing the flight, but also to lose my hotel reservation in Tokyo. But ultimately, it is not just the money, but the unpleasantness of having to deal with their personnel as badly suited to their job as they were. I did buy a ticket on line, but I will never fly Jetstar again.  I do want to say though that the food and service on the flight were good but that was not enough to compensate for my overall experience with this awful airline.",1
2018,"Sydney to Honolulu on 10th May. I just wanted to write this review today to thank the absolutely amazing crew. Staff were exemplary in there professionalism, courteous, attentive and super friendly.  Wish all of my flights were like this. Thanks Jetstar!",0
2018,"On April 26, I flew ADL-HBA with Jetstar. I wasnt expecting too much in the way of good service given the flights $55 price tag (before plus bundle), but I was pleasantly surprised from the outset. Although Adelaide Airports check in is now automated for all airlines, the girl at the kiosks managed to upgrade my friend and I to exit row seats at no extra charge. Service onboard was surprisingly delightful, and I would happily do it all again. Return leg from HBA-ADL was equally brilliant, and despite being stuck in a holding pattern delaying our landing for some 30 minutes, the crew did their best to ensure a seamless flight for all. Overall, a terrific experience.",0
2018,Both flights (Brisbane to Darwin and Darwin to Singapore) boarded and left on time. The seats were comfortable and I managed to get some sleep on both flights. I did not feel squashed. There was no onboard entertainment. I had an iPad with pre-loaded movies but I would have been prepared to pay a little extra for the option to access inflight entertainment onboard. I pre-paid for baggage and food vouchers so I had no issues with overweight hand luggage.,0
2018,"JQ 62, B787-8, 10th April 2018 (7 hrs 45 mins). I arrived about two hours before my flight and the check in process took about 50 min to complete. The immigration and security screening process took about 20 mins despite the airport being relatively busy. The Duty free shops in Ho Chi Minh airport offer competitive prices for spirits and other duty free items when compared with Australian airports. There are a limited selection of snacks and drinks by the departure gates, however they are 2-4 times the price when compared with a convenience store in the city. The flight started boarding about 40 mins before departure and the aircraft left the gate on time. I was seated in an aisle seat 34G, the Jetstar seats are charcoal leather and are relatively comfortable, however the seat pitch is only 30 inches which makes it a tight squeeze on long haul flights. Jetstar had a credit card only policy on this flight for all on-board purchases which can be problematic for those passengers without a credit card. There was good selection of new release movies, V shows and games on the IFE ($10 onboard or $9 pre booked). There are a few free TV shows available however these were predominantly short 15-20 mins fishing programs from the Top End. There were a reasonable range of snacks, hot food and sandwiches available from the on board menu although priced relatively high. It would be nice to see Vietnamese Beer (Saigon/Hanoi brands) on the beverage menu to add to Jetstars limited selection of beers on-board. The crew on the flight were friendly and helpful and dealt with some minor issues that occurred on the flight adeptly. The flight offered great views over the Australian Outback around Alice Springs, Broken Hill about 1hr+ before landing in Sydney. The flight arrived a few minutes early into Sydney, however we had to wait on the apron while an aircraft was pushed back from our assigned gate.",0
2018,"Melbourne to Brisbane. Worse airline! Cheap for a reason. Bad customer service, they just treat you like a number. They change flights, charge you $60 if your carryon bag is over by just a little bit, they make you walk to the plane from the gate even when if it's raining bad, they just do whatever they want! And their planes are small and uncomfortable",1
2018,"Melbourne to Bali. Its cheaper to go with an airline that offers luggage and meal for a family. They charge an arm and a leg for luggage but the problem is You have to purchase luggage both ways if you have purchased a return ticket. I purchased a return flight from Melbourne to Bali, on departure  I added on luggage 25kgs thinking this will also be added on my return? No it didn't, you have to pay extra for luggage on return ""how ridiculous is that"" because its a family off 5 i had to purchase 5x luggage going to bali and then 5x luggage returning home from bali. Do the math its cheaper to fly with another airline that offers all. After my flights I'm still being charged for inflight meals the problem is I can't speak to any humans about these false charges that jetstar is taking out from my credit card, you have to email back and forth to get your complaint heard or dealt with. My return flights was in March 2018 it is now the end of April and jetstar is charging my credit card for inflight meals even though it was paid in full at the time off my flights. I'm still waiting for my refund and hope Jetstar will erase my credit card details off there system. The food was horrible but because i had 3 kids i had no choice but to purchase meals. I will never use Jetstar again that was the first and last.",1
2018,"Jetstar Max Bundle is a complete rip off and simply awful! Much better to fly economy on a premium carrier like Thai Airways instead for around the same price. Jetstar is not a good airline at the best of times. I wouldn't fly Jetstar, but when I need extra baggage allowance (40 kg's as I sometimes have to travel with a lot of technical equipment for work) it has been a good option in the past. But Jetstar gets worse and worse as an airline year after year. I got the Max Bundle as I thought it would make the flight more comfortable and would reduce the cost of adding 40kg's anyhow. Neither was true. I did not get my upfront seat selection! The upfront area of the aircraft for max bundle is behind a whole section of economy class seats that weren't even available as an up front option with the max bundle. So the whole upfront seat selection is a lie. What else do you get with the Max bundle. One really small bad 'meal'. Apparently a voucher to use on another Jetstar flight if you cancel. I didn't need to, but I can imagine the process is at least as awful as the rest of the booking process. What you don't get with the Max Bundle: A blanket or anything to make the flight more comfortable. Inflight entertainment. All that costs a lot more. You also don't get the seat you book. It also took 45 minutes for the luggage to arrive at the carousel from this Jetstar flight. Conclusion: Don't buy the max bundle on Jetstar, fly economy on a premium carrier like Thai for approximately the same price.",1
2018,"Adelaide to Melbourne. Jetstar must be scratching for revenue - the plane was approx 3/4 full but they weighed everyones hand luggage. I was caught when checking bag in I had even upgraded from carry on to 15 kg - it turns out i could have taken some in my carry-on. They dont even give you any over, then hit me $ 15 per kg. I get being strict when plane is full but it was no where near capacity. I was 2.5 kg over.",1
2018,"Brisbane to Melbourne. After having previously tried to ensure that my baggage met the requirements and was within the size allowed for carry on luggage, I proceed straight through check-in not believing my carry on to be problematic. However, at the gate the airline staff weigh your baggage to ensure you meet the 7 kg weight requirement. I would understand this policy for excessively sized pieces, however, my bag came in at 8 kg and as a result of this occurring at the gate was forced to pay $60 for this bag that was 1 kg over the weight limit. This is clearly a penny-pinching method. Had the fee been appropriate for the additional weight carried I'd have had no problem. However, by this point I'd paid just as much as a Virgin or Qantas flight where this sort of penny-pinching isn't experienced. I don't recommend this airline as they clearly don't care about customer experience or service. In future I'd rather fly Tiger airways than Jetstar.",1
2018,"Sydney to Phuket. Check in (after my flight with domestic Jetstar Melb to Syd) was fine and surprisingly quick. The flight also left and arrived on time and I enjoyed the 787 aircraft. The staff were very helpful and polite as well , The international food that can be purchased has deteriorated on Jetstar. The food (2 minute noodles and a very average chicken parmigiana) was nothing to get excited about even for economy food. Air Asia was much better. IFE entertainment was very limited as well. There was a very restricted choice of movies and music. I wasn't even able to access the music . When I mentioned this to one of the staff he said he'd check. I heard nothing more. I was also annoyed that Jetstar constantly changed the flight schedules. Not easy when one has limited time . I was lucky my boss was reasonable and allowed me to change my vacation times. But again I did appreciate the staff, the 787, easy check in and punctuality.",0
2018,Melbourne to Sydney. Overall an enjoyable flight. Check in was no problem and the plane left on time I enjoyed the ham and cheese toastie that I prepaid. The staff were very helpful and friendly as well. There was no IFE which was no problem for such a short flight.,0
2018,"My flight from New Plymouth to Auckland was cancelled because there was no pilot. I missed my connecting flight and had to pay over $600 to get another ticket to go to Australia which in fact I had already paid. All I got from Jetstar was a sorry. Shame on you Jetstar. Get your act together or better still reimburse people when they have proof they missed connecting flights, or pay for those flights, even better.",1
2018,"Auckland to Christchurch. Check in, boarding and bag-wait took way too long - so inefficient. Really should have enforced more on baggage policies as people brought too many bags. Pre-flight conditions weren't even checked: my seatmate had tray table down while the plane took off.The stewardess didn't even care. Take off & landing were really smooth.  A320 was really old, and interior cabin smell gave people headache. Tray tables weren't cleaned properly. Toilet was clean though.",0
2018,"Hobart to Melbourne. A smooth and straight-forward flight which operated on time. The seats had slightly more legroom than those on a Virgin Boeing 737. The only gripe was that three of the four check-in machines in Hobart were not working, and there was only one bag-drop counter in operation. In Melbourne T4 our bags were on the carousel when we got there.",0
2018,"Hobart to Melbourne. As most people that fly with mountain bikes know, they typically come in around 23kg if packed in a commercial bike bag. Most airlines have at least a 23kg weight allowance and typically don't apply any oversize changes to sporting goods. I have flown overseas and intestate with Qantas, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Air Canada with a bike bag weighing between 23 and 24kg when packed and never once had an issue having it checked as my included bag. It has always without exception been carried under the flight's standard included luggage allowance This all changed when I flew the first (and last time) with Jetstar (on the return leg of a qantas flight) Jetstar only allow 20kg (which if you use a good commercial bike bag and have mountain bike you're almost certainly not going to come in under) AND an oversize bag charge that isn't waived for sporting goods like most airlines. This charge along with their $15 PER Kg charge will add about $70 to your flight each way. They will not take into account that you flew out with their partner airline on the same booking with which can lead to some obvious confusion when you cant come back with the luggage you flew out with. To top it of once they know you're at your weight limit the smell blood and really go in for the kill to make an extra buck. On our return flight the resorted to the utterly stupid level of weighing the wallets/purses you're carrying on board (even if they are not going in the carry on). While I acknowledge the whole ""we need to weigh your wallet and purse"" thing was probably just got someone having a bad day at check in it does go to underline the clear culture is making money from baggage charges however possible that must permeate through the airlines culture. So if you're flying with a bike I'd strongly look at using an alternate airline",1
2018,"Flew Christchurch to Sydney. Really really cramped, this is a new low even for Jetstar economy. You have to sit up completely straight to avoid knocking your knees on the seat in front.

2018,"Flew Adelaide to Sydney. I understand that Jetstar is a budget airline, and that the best quality of customer service, flight comfort, and safety cant be expected. However, its extremely unreasonable to do carry on baggage weight checks at the gate and not at the check-in outside of security, and then require passengers to pay 60 dollars to check in a bag. Had we been given this option, we would have put more weight into our actual checked luggage that still has extra room in it. Had we been given fair notice of this, then we could have easily gone back out of security and added more to our checked bag. The staff at the gate were extremely rude and not willing to explain why we couldnt just add our bag to our checked bag weight allowance, or why the bags that people were being forced to check in were all the charged the same price when they were all different sizes and weights. We had a customer service agent rudely address us, and I boarded the plane feeling Id been robbed. I know that this wont change any of Jetstars backward policies, but I hope that in the future, Jetstar is more prudent about how it goes about monitoring the weight going onto the plane. Dont use these methods to try and squeeze more money out of your passengersits wrong.",1
2018,"Sydney to Cairns. At the gate they weighed my carry on and made me pay $60 to check it in or forfeit my flight. I also had to change flights (the next day, weeks in advance) and they charged me full rate but gave me a $50 voucher which they wouldn't accept towards the $60 fee. Jetstar will continually find ways to squeeze 10-20% extra in every possible way.",1

2018,"Jetstar Business class is equivalent to Premium Economy on a full-service airline at best, and even then, struggles to achieve the same standard as QF Prem Y, for example. On this flight from Sydney to Denpasar, food offerings were meagre and among the worst airline meals I've had in over 30 years of frequent flying. Service was poor: e.g. Items not cleared in a timely manner: I ended taking my items to the galley myself (and saw other pax doing likewise). IFE selection is also paltry. And not that anyone else probably cares, but the Classical Music audio selection should be re-named ""Easy Listening"". My dessert choice was unavailable as well: a first-world problem I know. But when paying A$2400 for a ""max bundle"" fare one might be excused for expecting better. No priority tagging of luggage is on offer, so I also endured 40 minute wait for bag at DPS (and also on return to SYD). Basically one of the worst, if not the worst value-for-money trips I've ever taken. Only positives were that flight was uneventful and on-time.",1
2018,"Flew Singapore to Ho Chi Minh. Would never recommend Jetstar to another person. It's not good when you loathe an airline before you even board the flight. When the check out page says $xx, you hit confirm, and then you get a receipt saying you were just charged $xx+$20 with no explanation, it shows the company has no values and keeps fees hidden until you cannot back out. Many other airlines out there, I recommend always choosing another.",1

Then she said it's not my fault. So we all got wet and cold thanks, and they wouldnt even give us a blanket on board, just some paper towels. There were two entrances, they could have let us all in from the front one which was covered but they didnt. They didnt provide an umbrella and they didnt help.",1
2018,I enjoyed my trip. Check in was no trouble. The staff were very friendly and the prepaid meal (ham and cheese toastie) was fine for a short flight. There was a slight delay (10 minutes) which was no big deal. The service was very efficient for a full flight.,0
2018,"Honeymoon trip: Flight to Rarotonga was sub-standard. No water (we had requested but they seem to have forgotten and we weren't that thirsty anyway to follow up), flight attendants only chatting amongst themselves and you feel rude interrupting them. The plane was too cold and had been told that they don't offer blankets. If you want really bad service, definitely fly with Jetstar. Cancelled return flight leaving us stranded at the airport. Our return flight back to Auckland from Rarotonga had been cancelled and Jetstar gave us the wrong information for our recovery flight leading us to miss it completely. They have taken no accountability for this lack of communication that shouldn't be an issue in the first place for any reputable airlines (or business) and have never apologised for their error. There was a group of 30-40 of us who missed our flights because we weren't given the correct info. Who is running this? This whole ordeal has been very frustrating and stressful and have received no sufficient help or support from Jetstar throughout this whole process. We will never fly with Jetstar again and will strongly advise our network or friends and family to do the same. The cheap prices are really not worth the stress that comes with travelling with Jetstar.",1

We advised the crew that the seats we had booked and paid for 6 months ago were not the seats we had been allocated. After a lot of running around we were told that the flight had been oversold and that we had two options. Get off this flight and try to find our own flight with extra leg room seats. Sit in the seats we have been allocated, not extra leg room okay so you will hold this plane while our luggage is unloaded. No was the answer. Just take your seats you are holding this flight up. We sat in the seats allocated not the seats paid for. We were told that we would be contacted by someone from customer services within 24 hrs. No that didn't happen. We spoke to Jess via a chat, nothing they can do We took a trip out to the airport today to Jetstar customer service and spoke to a very abrupt man who told us there was nothing he could do. No one can help, no communication with Jetstar for a complaint just speak to a computer chat line. Whilst on the flight we were ignored by the staff and not even offered a cup of coffee.

2018,"Ayers Rock to Sydney. Check in was straight forward. Boarding, due to the late arrival of the airplane, the small airport terminal got very crowded and overflowing. There were not enough seats at one time. The boarding was a straightforward process. Many of the passengers were children. There was much activity on the seats and on the aisle. As it was not a full flight, I had to seek a quiet area in the plane. I guess, the activity was allowable or else the cabin crew would have taken action. The cabin crew were not as attentive as in a comparable QANTAS internal flight. The plane looked new and it appeared clean and fresh. Arrival, the baggage arrived soon after. We had hoped to avoid the Sydney rush hour, but because of the flight delay, we were in the middle of the rush hour. It took us longer to get to our hotel than expected.",0

The flight was delayed one hour because they didn't get the baggage count right. We missed our bus transfer, and had to buy new tickets. Not that big of a deal. Then, on our way home from Sapporo to Tokyo, we checked in, waited a few hours only to find out that our flights were cancelled, and we'd be missing our connection to Canada. We scrambled to find a different airline, but are now paying 3x more for flights, early morning taxis, train tickets that aren't being used, and extra baggage fees. I will never recommend them to anyone. The airplane itself was fine. At least you have that going for yourselves.",1

I did also purchase a coffee and a cake in advance from their website for the trip. Check in was very easy as I only had carry on luggage. I was able to use the check in machines which are easy to use. There was a slight problem leaving as the immigration gate malfunctioned that I was using. I was manually processed.

Once onboard I found the Cabin Crew a unenthusiastic as it was very routine with the attitude of get it done and over with. The Captain made one announcement and did not even mention flight times. Again, passengers seated in emergency exits were not iritirated with safety procedures. Overall, the flight was great but they need to refine their Customer Engagement.",0

Jetstar staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. They overbook flights to which they try make you feel responsible for. Seeking renumeration on a Jetstar fault seems like an extremely difficult task.

2018,Melbourne to Sydney. I've been flying around the world for years used more than 30 different airlines.  Today when flying Jetstar as a Flexbiz traveller (their highest traveling class for domestic flights) I was choked by the unpleasant behaviour from the check-in staff. When calling for a supervisor she's telling me that she is the one. To the point is that on my booking confirmation it says hand luggage is maximum 14 kg for business travellers. My two bags combine a weight of 14.1 kg. Now the staff tell me maximum for domestic business is 10kg (says nothing about that in the email confirmation). I tell her about the email and she acts cocky (like i'm lying). Now when showing her she claims that that's only valid for international travel. Then I ask how I could possibly know that when it says 14kg on my domestic confirmation. Her answer is that everything is clear. We were already paying for 60kg check-in luggage for two people. They had us reorganize our packing over 4kg claiming it's for security reasons. Then what they are saying is that it's more secure with 14 kg on international flights and that most airlines in the world flying A320s isn't safe enough as they are not applying these ridiculous rules. Now the fact that the so called supervisor refused to give me her full name says a lot.,1
2018,"Sydney to Melbourne. Jetstar staff need to learn what customer service is, they do not know how to welcome their customers, speak or address (no hi how are you, may I help you, sorry the flights been delayed, move here, put your bag here, pay here, terrible monotone announcements) customers or even hold a conversation! Very rude in approaching customers, even though we are all waiting back an hour for their delayed plane. Not worth saving the extra $50 to go budget airline. To top it off just tried contacting them direct to provide feedback and was cut off by the customer service person who diverted me to an online survey instead.",1
2018,"Gold Coast to Melbourne. I bought a flight that includes luggage but when I arrived at the airport they said my ticket didnt include luggage. The luggage I am carrying is within weight requirements in the US and EU, but here I had to pay an extra fee that cost more than I paid for the flight. The only positive aspect was the lady at the counter was very sweet and sympathetic. Nothing she could do, but she was nice about it. An airline should expect you to check luggage. I will never fly Jetstar again.",1
2018,Bali to Cairns. I understand its a low-cost airline but their excess wait for baggage fees are excessive! I had to pay $100 each way to have five extra kilograms and then on the return trip had to pay an extra hundred dollars for excess carry-on luggage that had to be checked. It wasnt so cheap one that was all over with. If I ever fly this way again I doubt I would use Jetstar.,1
2018,Sydney to Denpasar. The crew seemed very disengaged smiled on entry then never again. Meals were tiny for a premium price. Rubbish from meals was not removed until just before landing. Drinks (coffee etc.) came around around 1 hr into the flight then not again unless you paged the stewards. No offer of water for the flight unless you called the stewards. They seemed uninterested in the passengers hiding in the middle /end prep areas. Seats were cramped and flight full. Return to Sydney was worse. All water was confiscated prior to boarding. Again flight crew seemed disinterested in the passengers and meals were as above. No water unless asked for. Unfortunate as all water taken before boarding by Bali inspection of bags at the loading gate.  The crew seemed unhappy or dissatisfied and gave the bare minimum of service. Again not happy with having to pay for everything including old TV shows and music. I'll never travel Jetstar again on any flight over 1hr.,1
2018,"Gold Coast to Auckland. Probably the worst flying experience in 50 years of travelling! Staff rude and arrogant, paid extra $$ for luggage to be told as I was slightly over there would be a $225 excess charge and not to try to swap goods from suitcase to hand luggage to swap weight as hand luggage would be weighed at boarding and if heavier would be confiscated!  Paid extra for front row extra legroom that wasn't in system.",1
2018,"Launceston to Melbourne. Found the booking procedure easy to manage from the UK. Check in at Launceston was simple, straight forward, efficient and calm. Loved the 'RELAX' on the departure board prior to flights being called/boarding gates called etc. Tthe flight was on time in terms of both departure from Launceston and arrival in Melbourne. Staff were friendly, helpful and very pleasant.",0
2018,Melbourne to Uluru. Jetstar is a budget airline so don't expect all the frills that come with a full service airline. What I am looking for is courteous service and delivering me from point A to point B comfortably and safely. This they did well. The plane left Melbourne a little late but that was due to Melbourne airport traffic. They made up most of the time and was only 5 minutes late. The cabin staff went about their job in a business like and cheerful manner.,0
2018,"Sydney to Honolulu. They charged me $300 to take my carryon, claiming it was too big. I saw others that went through with similar sized, but they said they had to be backpack sized. If too heavy, u kinda understand but not for $300!  To top it off the agent was rude and I heard other agents complaining about customers that had questions. My flight was bout 9 hrs long and all I got was half a cup of water offered to me. Everything else I had to pay for.  None of their movies, music or games were free either. So in the end the flight cost wasn't cheap at all. For $8 a movie, I could buy the DVDs to keep! Never flying with them again and I advise to pay a little extra for better services and meals on flights.",1
2018,"Brisbane to Sydney. First time I have flown with Jetstar in 3 years, after previous experience with delays. After a relaxing time in the Qantas Club, the boarding process was a bit chaotic with no allocation specifics given. Once onboard the seats weren't the most comfortable but given the flight was only 1 hour, it wasn't too bad. No IFE during the flight so I was quite bored and no complimentary food/beverages, a true sign of LCC. Surprisingly, the flight was on schedule from take off and landed early as I take punctuality very seriously. I would fly Jetstar again to test their consistency and customer service.",0
2018,"Melbourne to Sunshine Coast. The flight departed and arrived on time. Check in was quite easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful . My pre booked meal (toasted ham and cheese sandwich) was quite tasty. One criticism, the beer could have been chilled. They had to offer ice. Overall an enjoyable flight.",0
2018,Melbourne to Brisbane. I paid for 20kg checked luggage. I only used 9kg. 11kg under weight. My carry on bag was about 1kg over the allowed 7kg (the work Laptop does it every time!) Jetstar charged me an extra $60 for the privilege of carring kgs I has already paid for. I fly fortnightly. Frequently with Jetstar. I won't be flying with them again.,1
2018,"Brisbane to Sydney. Unhelpful, rude and didn't care about me making my international flight in Sydney. Would not recommend to anyone. The worst flying experience I've ever had. I would recommend flying any other airline besides this one.",1
2018,"I would not book with Jetstar Airways again and would not recommend it to anyone. My flight from Auckland to Palmerston North was cancelled a few hours before I was due to depart. I have since learned that this is a common occurrence with this airline. We were offered other flights the following day but believe that at least one of these flights was also cancelled, thankfully we did not take the chance of finding out and booked with another airline. During our flight we heard stories from other passengers of repeated cancellations!",1
2018,"Flew with Jetstar from Sydney to Hobart return over the new year. The flight was much more expensive than normal, but that is to be expected during busy/peak travelling periods. Both routes were flown on the A320. The seats were fine, felt a little squashy at times but it was only a 1 hour 30 min flights. Cabin crew promptly came around with drinks and snacks, but I had brought my own food. No entertainment, but it's such a short flight it hardly matters. The incoming flight for our trip back to Hobart arrived late, but as soon as everyone was off the plane we boarded, which meant that the plane departed on schedule and arrived on time in Sydney. I've flown with Jetstar multiple times and have never had any issues with them. I will continue to fly with them.",0
2018,"Booking online was simple, as was the self check in and bag drop. However the departure gate was right at the far end of the terminal. It took ages to get to and it included various flights of stairs. Once there there wasn't anywhere near enough seating made available to sit and wait before boarding. This was made worse by very weak airconditioning. This is despite the airline requesting all passengers be there not less than 30 minutes before boarding time. It was a tiny plane. I was unable to move whilst in my seat and due to lack of space only got to make use of 1 of the 2 armrests. Cabin was dirty all over. As was the magazine which had all the puzzles filled in by previous passengers. My ticket said I was to get a $10 meal voucher but this never occurred. The menu was pretty awful anyway and staff service non-existent. It was a very boring flight even despite its brevity as there was no inflight entertainment. At least my bag came out very quickly the other end. In summary the best parts were start and finish but very poor in the middle.",0
2017,"Sydney to Cairns. A while back I was involved in a car accident and approximately a third of my body was burnt. I now wear compression garments which act to compress the skin. I go to the gym and weight train approximately 4 to 5 times a week and regularly go jogging and hiking. Over Christmas I flew from Sydney to Cairns with Jetstar. I booked an exit seat as I am 6 foot 2 and I like the leg space. On arriving I was told I was not allowed to sit in the exit as I was not physically capable of doing anything. After trying to explain that I had no issues at all and the garments were only for burn compression, I was moved to another seat and told to contact Jetstar if I wanted a refund. If that was not enough of an insult, I boarded the plane to find that my seat and the other exit seats were filled with people who I highly doubt were able to physically help anyone. I was obviously discriminated against purely on my appearance and at no time did they consider my situation.",1
2017,"Queenstown to Auckland. Jetstar imposes a highly restrictive and inflexible baggage weight policy. Jetstar does clearly articulate the requirements that must be met to avoid their unreasonable excess baggage weight fees, but if you are unaware and are over their limit, you will be unpleasantly surprised. In my case, my carry on bag was 12 Kg, 5 Kg above their 7 Kg maximum. I could not fit anymore items into my checked baggage to offset this weight. So, Jetstar charged me, not for the excess (5 Kg), but for the whole 12 Kg at NZD 15/Kg or NZD 180! This was far more than the cost of my seat on the flight from Queenstown to Auckland. The whole experience was the only blemish on a fantastic 2-week trip throughout New Zealand. My suggestion to future Jetstar passengers: travel with a portable luggage scale or consider flying with an airline that is more customer-oriented than Jetstar.",1
2017,"Brisbane to Sydney on December 10. Great service, value for money. Flight was on time, craft was new and clean, service was efficient and professional. Meal was better than expected. A pleasant change when comparing to another low cost airline I was using during my stay in Australia. Next time, I would choose Jetstar for my national flights in Australia.",0
2017,"My flight to Brisbane was cancelled due to weather, I had a flight to Mackay the following morning departing at 8.55 am. They were not able to connect me with another flight. After being on the phone and waiting in line for over an hour all they would offer me was a Jetstar voucher stating they could not give a monetary refund. My wife spoke to them and informed them the reason for my trip was to visit my terminally ill father they requested a hospital statement before they would issue a refund. They also offered me a voucher for the flight I would miss tomorrow. I then had to pay $400 for a flight with another airline. I will never fly with Jetstar again. They are callous, uncaring and unprofessional.",1
2017,"Flew on JQ409 from the Gold Coast to Sydney this morning. Upon arrival at Gold Coast airport, we checked in using the kiosks  a process which was smooth and simple as both the check-in kiosk and the automated bag drop system were very easy to use. Boarding started around 7 minutes late but (because of the efficiency of the process) we departed right on schedule. The flight itself was rather uneventful, taking around an hour to get to Sydney. The seat was comfortable, though the legroom was quite cosy. All food and drink on board had to be purchased. The landing in Sydney was smooth, and disembarking was as smooth as boarding. Overall, I would definitely consider flying with JetStar again in future as the flight experience overall was very good (particularly for a budget airline).",0
2017,"Hobart to Perth via Melbourne. I have flown Jetstar a few times and only once had a good experience this flight was the worst making a last minute quick trip to Perth. Had carry on only as I have a handbag/laptop bag and small suitcase at gate I stupidly weighed suitcase again, it was 1 kg over, I again stupidly honest let the girls know, I thought I could just transfer something to handbag. This honesty cost me $60 and a further $32 at Melbourne for next leg. When calling to complain I may as well have been told learn to be dishonest like a lot of others have learned to be or don't fly with Jetstar. I will be choosing to fly virgin from now on and will not recommend to anyone. virgin have luggage auto included and a snack or meal on plane depending on flight time and free in flight entertainment. Jetstar has none of these so if you work out the charges for these extras supplied free from virgin, it works out virgin is a lot cheaper and the staff are amazing.",1
2017,"Brisbane to Melbourne. This was my first fight with Jetstar and had no previous expectations of the airline. We had quite a bit of luggage as we were moving from Canada to Australia and had everything that we came over with, so we had to purchase extra luggage. Although we had to pay the extra surcharge for 30 kg's of checked luggage each the price was very reasonable (Considering a similar flight in Canada would probably be double the cost). Prior to boarding I saw another Jetstar flight weighing carryon baggage to make sure that everyones carryon baggage met the standard of 7kg. I was a little worried because although we only had a backpack each, 7kgs is not a lot of weight. However, when it was time for our flight to board we did not have to weigh our carry on bags. I am not sure why we got the pass on the scale and the other flight had to weigh their bags. The flight itself took off on time and had the seatbelt sign off within a few minutes. We were in Seats 20 E & F, however as there was a kid kicking the back of my seat I moved as there was free seats in row 20 ABC. The leg room was probably the worst pitch I have ever sat in, coming in at 29 inches. I am 188cm (6' 2"") tall, so this was uncomfortable for me however anyone smaller would be okay for the short flight. The staff came around just after take off to do a service. Standard stuff was available for purchase (hot/cold drinks, sandwiches, snacks), but there was no complementary drinks or snacks. There was a family sitting in the 2 rows behind us that had 5 small kids that were making a lot of noise and not following the seatbelt sign. At one point the staff acted very professionally and asked the parents to get the kids back in their seats for landing. We landed on time and exited the plane on the tarmac, but were walking distance to the terminal so we didn't need a bus. Overall an average flight for the price we paid, I probably would not recommend as the legroom was uncomfortable and there were a lot of families and children that made the flight seem chaotic at times. The price was okay though, and as long as you know what you were getting into with a low cost airline it is an okay way to get around Australia for a reasonable price.",0
2017,"Flew from Christchurch to Auckland and they didnt check the weight of our carry on bags but at the Auckland Jetstar they did. The staff in Auckland airport made sure she checked every single bag even my husbands laptop. Weve flown to a load of places and no airline has made him weight his laptop except this one. Due to this The weight of our carry on bags exceeded 2kg. (Our two suitcases, laptop and my handbag). They charged us $60 saying it has to be checked in. All Jetstar wants is more money. What annoys me is Christchurch jet star didnt weigh our bags. Shouldnt rules be the same for Christchurch and Auckland? When I spoke to another staff member she said that Auckland is Auckland and Christchurch is Christchurch. That doesnt make sense to me. I say thats poor team work and rules arent very consistent. Dont think I will ever fly with Jetstar again. Their cheaper than Air Nz but they try to charge every little cent out of you which then makes it more expensive than Air Nz. I will be going with Air Nz next time.",1
2017,"Melbourne Avalon to Sydney on the 21st November, the 15.45 service. Arrived at the terminal punctually, went through check-in and security swiftly, and was given an excellent seat by the ground crew (who also overlooked the fact that my baggage was 1KG over). Onboard, the service was fairly good (but not great) for a run-of-the-mill Jetstar flight, and we landed in SYD 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Overall, Id recommend Jetstar if there was a great sale, or if using Avalon, where the ground crew are consistently exceeding expectations as well as the airline being able to offer cheaper prices from this airport.",0
2017,"Hobart to Melbourne Tullamarine. Second time flying with Jetstar and they impressed me. One thing worth mentioning about Hobart airport is that when we were boarding, it was raining. And the airport was kind enough to provide us with umbrellas when walking across the tarmac (No boarding bridges at Hobart airport) Once boarded, it was refreshing to see the new Jetstar interior, especially the brand-new seats. They were thinner than other  seats, which enabled a greatly increased amount of leg room. They shifted the seat pocket to above the tray table, thus increasing the leg room. The cabin crew was nice with positive attitudes towards passengers. My only complaint would be the inadequate amount of lavatories onboard (only one in the front and two in the rear) compared to five in some airlines' A321s, but it's a budget airline, and it's not too bad for a 55-minute flight. The flight was delayed due to bad weather, but the captain was very prompt to provide updates. Overall a fairly nice experience at this price point and I would recommend it to the people who are looking to save a few bucks on your plane ticket. (The inflight entertainment was just a magazine btw).",0
2017,"The route says Sydney to Melbourne Tullamarine, but Jetstar sent me to Melbourne Avalon. I just got off a Qantas 787-9 flight, and I wanted to fly back to Melbourne cheaply, so I booked Jetstar. Jetstar cancelled my flight to Melbourne while I was walking to the gate, because of weather that had already passed in Melbourne. I can tell you that Qantas and Virgin Australia were still flying, so if I had chosen to pay the extra $100 for a Qantas fare, I would've been fed, and comfortable. But in this case, Jetstar stranded me in Sydney and I had little to no money, and NO help was given. They just booked me on a flight to Avalon for the next day. So, I spent the night in Sydney's International Terminal with np sleep, and no support whatsoever from Jetstar, because I had no money, I could'nt afford a hotel room, and as a 16 year old, it was quite scary. Hotels were booked out because of the Cancellation too. I flew to Avalon the next day, and  Seats were uncomfortable, aircraft was dirty. Cabin crew were not very nice, and service was terrible.",1
2017,"Melbourne to Sydney. I have been flying for business for 5 years no problems, but today Jetstar charged 60 dollars for my bag weighing 9 kilos. Change of clothes computer and a toothbrush. That is utterly ridiculous as it is well undersized and fits in the overhead locker easily.",1
2017,Adelaide to Sydney. We were late to the boarding gate (beyond our control) and the lady screamed at us like we were children. Not sure what side of the bed she woke up on but I would expect a bit more maturity from an adult woman. Seats weren't comfortable and leg room was barely the minimum. Next time I will pay extra and fly with an airline that treats its customers with respect.,1
2017,"Hobart to Melbourne. They try to steal as much as they can with the weight. For every kilo you pass they will charge you 25 dollars. Thats insane, try using other airlines more comprehensive, if you pass one kilo they will charge It. One flight they charged me something but for the next one, with the same amount of kilos they tried to charge me more. Wherever they can earn more money they will take advantage of it.",1
2017,"Flew Sydney to Launceston. Jetstar provided a good quality product and service. I paid a low fare and could check in via their app up to 28 days in advance. The flight left on time, arrived early, and the crew were professional and helpful. There was also good information from the flight deck. LCCs tend to get hammered when things go wrong or maybe when customers dont do their research, but I knew what Jetstar offered and what they didnt when I bought the ticket and I feel they are good value and relatively comfortable to fly with. My only negative was the long line for bag drop in Sydney. Maybe a Melbourne-style automated system would be better.",0
2017,"Terrible Airline! Flew Queenstown to Bali via Sydney. Will never fly with them again! Of course its a budget airline and I understand that but seriously its a joke. We purchased luggage for 35kg then when we arrived and tried to check in they tell us 32kg is the max! Nowhere does it say it can be in up to 10 bags! They weigh your carry-ons to the T. 7kg and no more. So here we are at the check in counter being pregnant, trying to put on layers and layers of clothes which we are just going to take off after security and put right back in the bag so whats the difference. I've never had an airline weigh and criticize our carry on luggage. We still ended up having to pay another 100 dollars for another checked bag at the counter. First she said it would be 75 dollars, then when we are abour to pay tells us oh it's 100 dollars because you have another stop. So we ended up paying an extra 250$ for nothing. We could have just booked Qantas for cheaper, have our bags included, no hassle with carry on weight, a meal included and complimentary alcoholic beverages included. Worst experience with Jetstar. Would not recommend.",1
2017,"Avalon to Gold Coast. They cancelled a flight and left passengers to find their own way to another airport for a later flight, then flew us to a different destination too. They showed a complete lack of consideration for their passengers and did not offer any valid compensation (6 month non transferable voucher offered, although we told them no possibility of using it).",1
2017,Boarding took ages because of Jestar's inconsistent baggage policies. Flight landed early but disembarking took at at least 35min. Ground staff told us plane was parked at the wrong spot for incorrect airbridge! Seat width and pitch was good enough. Leather seat wasn't very comfy. The plastic seat pocket replacing the IFE screen area is unconvincing. Couldn't hold lot of items at all. Not clean either. Also disappointing was seat air con knob wasn't working and water could only be retrieved if people push the call button. The whole flight was noisy due to dozens of call button rings. The best part was the courteous and friendly crew service. Also impressive was the great piloting skills - smooth descent and no turbulence at all throughout flight.,0
2017,"Gold Coast to Sydney. Worst airline I have ever flown with, a delay leaving Sydney 30 mins which isnt too bad, but delayed 2.5 hours leaving Gold Coast. Announcement By tannoy but not one Jetstar member gateside of the airport so had now way of being able to speak to someone. Delay only announced 10 mins before original boarding time so most people already waiting at gate. Very disappointed not to see any Jetstar staff - definitely not travelling with them again.",1
2017,Sydney to Auckland. Terrible experience from beginning to end. The flight was cancelled while we were in the line to check in. We were offered an alternative flight with Qantas however it was 7 hours later and we had commitments back in New Zealand so asked if we could arrange a refund as we would have to purchase flights on another airline. The customer service manager agreed and said she'd make notes in their system regarding the details. We purchased last minute flights on an alternative airline at horrendous expense being last minute and flew home. When I went to follow up the refund I was bounced around no less that five different people and pushed to online chats no-one being able to assist and all saying that we had boarded the plane and taken the flight. No 'notes' were ever put in the system and they had to launch an 'investigation'. Two weeks later they send me an email saying that as per their terms here was a voucher to the value of the flight. I replied saying that the Customer Service manager had agreed to refund the flight given the circumstances and received no reply. I re-sent the email a week later and also received no reply. Every aspect of the dealing was absolutely horrendous and took a lot of self focus to breath through it and not react in an angry fashion. At least writing this review has given a means to express my dissatisfaction and let it go.,0
2017,Denpasar to Sydney. Absolute worst experience Ive had in 20 years of flying. Jetstar promised to compensate my friend and I for a mishap they made and then ignored our calls and emails when it came time for payment. Im totally disgusted at how they treat customers and would always recommend travelling with another airline.,1
2017,"Sydney to Honolulu. Worst airline in the world. Had ordered meals and paid for meals which they did not have on board when we flew. The so called customer care person emailed to apologise and provided vouchers which are not transferable, have to be used in six months and have a host of other conditions which makes them very hard to use. Also he has failed to respond to any emails we have sent. The complaint was taken by the stewardess onboard, so they just sent an email with excuses and then sent these worthless vouchers and ignored all other correspondence. Jetstar are quick to take your money for pillows, meals, entertainment etc but do everything to ensure they don't give you a refund in cash. They send these highly conditioned vouchers which clearly you will have little chance of using so they don't provide the service and then also keep your money! Don't fly with Jetstar.",1
2017,"I am very upset by the staff. I have never had a problem with my carry-ons fitting in the cabin, etc., and I have traveled on 10-12 domestic Australian flights in the last 2 months. But today they took my carry-on out of my hands in the boarding line, said it was too big, and made me pay $60 to check it. I am irate. The way it was handled was very degrading and upsetting. I will not be traveling with Jetstar in the future, not ever again.",1
2017,"Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. Tried to upgrade my seat from Economy to Business. Upgrading via the site gave me errors. Called the phone numbers on their app (2 in Vietnam) both wrong numbers. Found the correct numbers eventually - phone went to the hold music and hung up after 10 mina, twice. Went to the airport early to upgrade, Jetstar staff told me to wait for check in to open and do it at the counter. Went to counter and they said I had to do it before check in opened and it's too late now - and it was the same guy that told me to wait. The kicker though, he grinned at me. Crew on board just chatted to each other and were barely seen. In addition: 5 flights with Jetstar equals 33 emails, 4 flight changes, 17 SMS's, different contact number for each email, emails to check in for flights they cancelled.",1
2017,"Jetstar website said if they have changed their confirmed delay time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, they don't notify us unnecessarily of a potential flight delay that can be brought back on to schedule or does not eventuate.They have failed their guarantee. The flight arrival time was changed without any notification. If I didn't go online to check. I won't know. They change the arrival time but not departure time. I feel like I got tricked. I was planning to catch another connection flight, but I couldn't make it. It is meant to depart at 7am, but till 7am, we are not even boarding. If Jetstar notified us earlier, we could have got another flight. They are so unfriendly too. I called the hotline and they said I can move to an earlier, but when I arrived, they said it is full. Also, the airport staff is very rude and unfriendly. I feel like treated second class just because I am flying economy. The flight attendants are the worst. Please never ever ever fly with them. Totally disappointed. Everyone is waiting at the gate, but there is no staff around trying to help us out.",1
2017,"Flew Brisbane to Sydney. Worst flight attendants on my flight. Checking in and boarding was fine but the flight was terrible, I had a crying 1 year old who just cried non-stop being her ears were sore, not once did any of the 4 flight attendants come to see if she was alright. I was blocked in my seat so I couldnt stand with her and not once did any of them come to see if she was okay or if she needed anything. They would just walk past everytime. They looked miserable and so untidy, they basically looked like they had just woken up. I am so dissappointed all other airlines I have travelled offer the most amazing help and support. I will never ever travel with Jetstar again.",1
2017,"Sydney to Melbourne. I received a message 3 minutes before walking out the door to catch my late evening flight with Jetstar. ""Your flight from Sydney is cancelled. Go to website to check your flight options. We're sorry your flight has been cancelled."" Bit of a pathetic apology, but I jumped online immediately to investigate. This was due to bad weather - so not Jetstar's fault, but their responsibility to compensate none-the-less especially considering other airlines were still flying from Sydney, and I was paying for a promised service. My reason for booking a late flight was that I was working my part time job (ie.can't afford the higher fares for Qantas or Virgin) in the day and needed to fly from Sydney to Melbourne for a job interview. The interview was at 9am on Thursday, so the alternative afternoon flights they were offering on Thursday afternoon were not a solution. I was told that I could swap my flight for an afternoon flight on Thursday, or morning flight on the Friday. Or a voucher for the amount of the cancelled flight. I explained that my reason for travel was a job interview in the morning (not just leisure or an unimportant trip) and therefore an afternoon flight was pointless. I could not be flexible - not to mention my return flight to Sydney was scheduled for 3pm. Arrive in Melbourne at 1pm and return to Sydney at 3pm the same day?? I told them I had no need for a change of time and date unless that change landed me in Melbourne in time for my interview. I was given more options (and then fewer options) for Thursday afternoon or Friday, and not one that actually properly compensated me for this cancellation. A voucher provided in five business days was not a solution, and with no extra planes added the following day to compensate for the hundreds of passengers put out; I was left with no solutions, and out of pocket. Finally I agreed to their only form of refund (despite the assistant explicitly saying at one point Jetstar can refund cash depending on the reason...ie whether they deem it worthy). It was this point that I was offered the amount for the cancelled flight, only. They still tried to charge me the cost of the return flight despite cancelling my initial flight! The attempt to still charge me for the return flight, after an hour of nil solutions, was enough to firm my mind. Avoid Jetstar. They do not care about their customers. They are a budget airline because they take advantage of their customers to make a profit. I could only just afford the flight to an interview. Another reviewer summarised Jetstar well: This airline is highly unreliable carrier with an arrogant culture and devious selling practices.",1
2017,"Brisbane to Nagoya. My booking had me flying to Osaka and travelling by late night bullet train to Nagoya. As I arrived at Brisbane airport I received an SMS stating that my Jetstar flight from Cairns to Osaka has been cancelled. It took 90 minutes before Jetstar provided a solution- a flight on Qantas to Tokyo not Osaka. So I arrived late at night, miles from Osaka and had to arrange bullet train to Nagoya at my expense. This was my second Jetstar international flight that Jetstar cancelled and transferred the recovery costs to me. Behind schedule I decided to return on the same flight but extend for five days. The Jetstar Indian based dialogue centre tried to charge me $630 to change my flight. I rejected and used the ""manage my flight"" option. I was charged $300. My complaint letter to Jetstar was acknowledged, by a corporate apologist who stated that I had changed my return route. I hadn't changed my route - I changed the day. The excuse for their cancellation was unavoidable technical difficulties. So my experience with Jetstar is two cancelled flights with no apology or compensation for the extra costs. This airline is highly unreliable carrier with an arrogant culture and devious selling practices.",1
2017,Great flight with Jetstar Airways from Christchurch to Auckland. Great food and the staff were very friendly. I suppose the only bad thing was a delayed flight. But overall I am happy. Jetstar meets all expectations. One time my partners flight was late and he was given a free voucher.,0
2017,"Sydney to Auckland on June 17th. Checked-in was convenient and fast in the counter. My Seat was 10D. The space of the seat was narrow,so my knees had to touch the front seat. I felt uncomfortable. The service of cabin crew was just at the standard level. But this flight was value for the price.",0
2017,"Jetstar are the same as any low cost airline in that they charge for everything, and are totally inflexible about any changes or limits. But that's expected, and really no worse than any other LCC. When something goes wrong (flight cancellation, rescheduling or delay), however, Jetstar reach a whole new level of terrible. Their staff are at best unhelpful and at worst incompetent. To be fair, the staff are hamstrung by Jetstar's ridiculous customer-hostile policies, even when the fault is theirs. They cancelled my flight from Honolulu-Melbourne, and were unable to get me on another flight for 3 days. When I purchased a ticket on a Hawaiian airlines flight to Sydney, Jetstar refused to put me on a Jetstar flight from Sydney to Melbourne. Unless you have flexibility of several days in your travel plans, I would recommend avoiding Jetstar.",1
2017,"Melbourne Avalon to Sydney. The Jetstar check-in staff at Avalon airport weighed my hand luggage and said I was 2kg over. I carried exactly the same stuff I brought from Sydney last night on a full flight and there wasn't an issue. Jetstar at Avalon wanted $60 for 2kg of extra luggage.  I told them that I could have put on 2kg in one day and it wouldn't make an iota of difference. The staff were rude and uncooperative. This is the only authority they have in the real world and it goes to their head. So I had to go through my laptop bag, throw out some paperwork I will have to reprint back at the office and put about a kg of stuff (such as USB drive, small batteries, etc) into my pockets. All because of pig-headed Jetstar staff.",1
2017,"For the price, this short flight to Launceston was value for money. Although we had a small delay, the comfort of the Melbourne Airport Domestic terminal, made up for the 1 hour delayed flight (something that seems to be a common thread when flying Jetstar). Expect nothing fancy or over the top and you should have a good time when flying Jetstar.",0
2017,"Phuket to Melbourne. Booked for 1020pm, luckily I looked at my emails and saw it was not going till 3.30am. We had to book another hotel near the airport and because it wasn't delayed by 6 hours can't claim. They gave us a voucher to get something to eat at a burger place. No chips, no coffee, only nuggets and fish burger and the staff were very rude. We will never travel Jetstar again. We paid top dollar for our trip, dinners, extra baggage etc. We had an awesome time in Thailand but going home just spoiled our trip .",1
2017,Jetstar is the worst airline my partner and I have ever flown. The flights are delayed every single time we have flown. No food vouchers or any compensation were ever offered. Their staff are rude and inconsiderate not to mention they know nothing to do with what's going on. They have never been helpful in any situation we have encountered with them (which are many). We were moved to a separate flight on another occasion and had to talk to 4 people before they moved us back and when we questioned why we were moved in the first place they wouldn't answer and we are positive it's because the flight was oversold. There are consistently issues with their flights and we will never be flying with them again.,1
2017,Flew Melbourne to Sydney. The Jetstar Airways is the worst airline that I have come across in last 15 years of regular flying experiences. Their staff at check-in are not nice and are inconsiderate. The flights are almost always invariably delayed. The flights regularly get cancelled. The cabins can be untidy and are not clean.,1
2017,"Bali to Melbourne. Had two flights delayed. The first was for ""operational reasons"" - from looking into it I just think they were trying to squeeze in an extra flight, we never got an explanation. We have two young children so the ""alternative"" flights they offered for the first delay didn't work. Ended up canceling and re booking flights a few days later at a significant cost. The second flights also ended up being delayed by a day due to technical issues. I can understand that it happens sometimes and was OK with it. Jetstar offered to pay for accommodation and a meal allowance for the 4 of us up to at total of of US $700. I have receipts etc but have so far been offered reimbursement of of US$250. I emailed twice, no response and spent about 7 hours on live chat getting nowhere and making me feel like I am the one in the wrong. This is only half of it but I'm not going to go on.",1
2017,"Proserpine to Brisbane. Jetstar, thank you for a wonderful stress-free trip on 1st July. I accompanied my 90 year old mother who needed special assistance to get on and off the plane. All staff were friendly and very helpful. And a special thank you to our buggy driver at Brisbane airport. Unfortunately I don't know his name, but he was amazing - so gentle and caring with my mum - I was so impressed!",0
2017,"Melbourne to Sydney. I paid extra for extra leg room because I have a knee issue, seats changed without notice only after complaining I got a $50 dollar voucher. Next time tried to use said vouchers, great they spelt my name wrong the voucher is unusable, flight goes up in price more than the voucher is worth while it takes them a week to change the name.",1
2017,Flew Jetstar from Melbourne to Phuket. 4 of use in total. At check in at Melbourne I thought the check-in staff were quite rude and not at all that happy to assist with their new check-in procedures. Having never used this before we stumbled and the female attendant was quite rude. Felt like she was talking down to us. On the flight 3 of use had 11 GHJ going over with a bulkhead behind us. The seat back still reclines the normal amount and the great thing is no one behind pulling your seat or asking for it to be raised. Watched a few movies over which is quite limited in its selection. Food was roast chicken and another friend had pork. Both meals were quite good. Service was good and overall a good flight. An hour late leaving but made up some time and only half hour late getting in. Return flight we had row 10 GHJ these are great seats. No one in front. Heaps of leg room. Again food and service was good. We landed half an hour early. Overall two good flights.,0
2017,"Denpasar to Singapore. Beautiful experience at this airport with staff. There were smiles and patient explanations given throughout. One of the ground staff at my flight had assisted in explaining why my odd shaped luggage was not suitable and needed to be checked in at the airline counter. Feeling skeptical at that point and ready to lose that piece (it's a kite, light and small but has poined ends and hence hand-carry abroad was not allowed), was pleasant to find luggage arriving in 1 piece. We did not purchase check in luggage space and hence was surprised by the additional service provided to check in our kite at no additional cost. A very big thank you to the ground staff who attended to us.",0
2017,"Jetstar Flight JQ44 - Denpasar to Melbourne on 4 May 2017. Jetstar Denpasar staff started boarding the aircraft approx. 50 minutes before scheduled departure (which was good, this avoiding the usual boarding crush/rush) enabling the flight to depart right on time. A new aircraft - clean - comfortable seating for economy. Not much leg room, but which airline does provide a lot of legroom in the Economy cabin. We prepaid our Entertainment. A reasonable selection of movies, TV programs. Nice size screen & easy to operate. We had also preordered a meal for this flight for $24. Cabin crew stated handing out meals not long after takeoff, so it was really a very early dinner. The serving size (roast chicken) was very small, but the actual quality was very good. In addition to the chicken, we received a cup of water and a small chocolate bar. Not particularly good value. Flight was very comfortable. We had a spare seat next to us, so that was good. The aircraft is very quiet. Clean toilets. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. Overall a very good flight.",0
2017,"Cairns to Sydney. I arrived at check in as per normal, as a musician I was travelling with my guitar alongside my bandmates, who also had guitars. We had already booked a lot of very expensive extra baggage. when two of us arrived the airline check-in staff told us we had to pay an extra $25 per guitar as a fee for oversize baggage. I was offended as this is an obvious money making exercise on behalf of jetstar and I travel frequently with many airlines and over 20 years with a guitar have never been asked for this before, oversize baggage handling is a very minimal service which mostly involves the passenger taking the bags to a different conveyor. The ground staff argued with me trying to tell me that it was always the case and that other airlines charge the same amount. When my bandmate arrived to check in with the same booking, he wasnt charged any extra fee they didnt even mention it. When i made a complaint I just got the run-around.",1
2017,"Singapore to Surabaya. I am a frequent Jetstar customer and satisfied with the service till I had a disappointing experience today with the service attendant. The location of check in in changi airport has just changed and I was clueless. After checking in at the e-kiosk, I queue for back drop and there is one counter for back drop and document check. I queue from the left and the person said, ""what are you here for?"" I answered for back drop. She said, ""next time queue on the left, not on the right!"" with a rude tone. I feel dissatisfied with the way she speak as she need to understand that the location have just changed and customer making mistakes are expected. She need improve on communication skills for Jetstar to keep the regular customers happy.",1
2017,"Flew Adelaide to Melbourne-Avalon on Mother's Day with only carry-on baggage booked, I paid the bargain basement price of $58 for a return flight to Melbourne.  I wasn't, however, impressed with Jetstar's new policy of weighing each passenger's carry-on bag as they approach the boarding gate, with the intention of slugging each passenger with excess baggage a small fortune to place the bag in the hold. This is something that should be done at check-in, as it only holds up the queue. On board, the service was good, but not great, and overall tolerable for the short hour-long flight to Melbourne-Avalon. The return flight  on May 17 was very similar, with some divergences. This time, I checked in at the counter (I happened to do some shopping in Melbourne and pre-paid checked baggage), and Jetstar's Avalon Ground Crew couldn't have been more helpful or polite. On board, however, the service was once again good, but nothing to write home about. Overall I'd recommend Jetstar only if there was a significant difference in price between other airlines, including Tigerair (far superior to Jetstar as an LCC in Australia), or if one wanted to fly to Melbourne Avalon Airport, a beautiful little Airport some 40kms out of Melbourne's CBD which was an absolute breeze to visit and to use.",0
2017,"Singapore to Sydney. Worst experience ever with customer service. They double charged me and didn't refund me even though I provided evidence. My flight also got cancelled from Singapore to Sydney. My husband, daughter and I were meant to be on the next flight. Waited 6 hours because they couldn't simply generate a boarding pass for my infant. I will never fly with them again.",1
2017,"Auckland to Palmerston North. Was in a hurry so checked in online, didn't print out my boarding pass 'cause I didn't even have time (my bad). Was hoping the boarding pass with a bar code on my phone would be ok, lady at boarding gate didn't seem to have a problem with that at all so she checked me in as normal. They ended up checking the wrong person in and gave it to me as me and the other one had the same surname and first name's initial. Obviously this resulted 2 people with the same seating, tried to explain to staff what I thought happened, apologized for the confusion because I felt at fault. The guilty feeling stopped when this lady was rude and blamed the whole thing on me for holding the wrong boarding pass. Well, I'm sorry that your staff was the one who checked the wrong person in, instead of using the booking reference to ensure they checked in the right person, they used the last name (which can be very common). It was amazing how I received no apologies for the mistakes on their end and had to feel bad for my mistakes only. I only thought it was ok to use a boarding pass on phone because I never had an issue with using it in the past with Jetstar. The flight attendant was sweet enough to check if I was ok afterward but then said ""it's alright"" like ""yeah, we forgave you""??? This time it's not the delays that bother me (you get what you pay for), it's the attitude of staff.",1
2017,"Melbourne to Singapore. Good value for money, despite it was below of our expectation. It is the least comfortable Boeing 787-8 I have traveled in business class with a 2-3-2 configuration and we were in the 3. It is good value as it includes 30Kg of luggage, food, in-flight entertainment for an 8 hour flight. Food quality and service was acceptable to good.",0
2017,"Perth to Cairns. It is a classic low cost airlines, not much legroom, it was a 4 hour flight, not a very comfortable one, except that airfare was reasonable. It was a red eye flight. I would recommend the airline only when fare is considerable less than Qantas or Virgin Australia.",0
2017,"Flew Jetstar from Melbourne to Denpasar. The coldest plane I have ever been on, I was pretty warmly dressed in jeans, jumper, boots and socks, and was still absolutely freezing. I asked for a blanket which I was told was 15$ so I asked if they could turn off the A/C as everyone was wearing hoods/scarves around their heads etc and the flight attendant tried to tell me it was 25c! It was well under 20. We also took off 1.5h late due to faulty cabin lights and were on the plane the whole time, no offer of water or anything. It wouldn't be so bad if this ""budget"" airline had prices to match the service/quality but it doesn't.",1
2017,"For a weekend trip from Sydney to Melbourne I had tried to use Qantas Group points and pay, only to find lots of  block outs on Sun afternoon. So ended up on Qantas domestic on the way down, and Jetstar on the way back up. At the time of booking I was able to get seating for QF 443, so not JQ 526. (And no, that Q doesn't stand for quality, more like questionable). Called JQ, after being on the phone got seating I wanted. Even got charged for it, though I wasn't advised of this. Although I have the QF app (which after the flight showed JQ526), I had to download the JQ one as well for some reason. All the way Tripit showed it as QF443 / QF478 operated by JQ (JQ526) Ah well. It then changed from exit row to + 4 rows to -1 row to ultimately another 11 rows and exit row. We got to the airport in time to get some dinner, then realised bag drop only available 2 hours before flight (and check in on the machine 3 hours before flight). It then asked if okay with exit row, but still got shuffled around. Though staff at the counter fixed it having seen some charge had been send through, which Amex showed as pending. Still not sure why. Flight was may be 3/4 full. Last time I flew JQ was probably a decade or so ago, thanks for reminding me why, even for short haul.",1
2017,"Sydney to Honolulu return. I found the experience quite good, on time peformance on outward and return. As for hidden costs? Paid for more leg room in economy, got 30 kg luggage allowance. Added comfort pack (best ever on economy class, full of goodies). Cost clearly stated, my choice to add on. Entertainment pack added at extra cost, again clearly stated. Meal included just had to pre order. Only problems was a misbehaving passenger.",0
2017,"Auckland to Christchurch. Before my trip, I had purchased the particular seating both from and to Auckland. And Jetstar had sent me the confirmation of my seating after I had made the payment. When I got to the airport, I found out that they just simply changed my seats both from and to Auckland. I told them I had purchased the seat and had the confirmation for it. They didn't want to help at all.",1
2017,"Bangkok to Melbourne. This is a scam calling this service business class - it is nowhere near it, not even premium economy. I have flown with Jetstar on this route to and from Bangkok numerous times since it's inception but this is the last time ever. Everything has gone down hill so much in the two years since I last did it. Check in was a debacle at Bangkok with economy passengers checking in at business desk whilst we waited but no economy check in agent called us up and economy passengers got priority ! Boarding is like a herd of cattle swarming and again no priority. I was most angered by the meal service which was very sparse, linen napkins replaced with paper ones, no second cup of tea, just quickly swiped the tray away. Breakfast was a piece of cake and margarine (not even butter). Really, really disappointed and despite being a frequent and loyal customer I will not be back.",1
2017,"Melbourne to Townsville. Hearing some bad reviews about cancellations and delays with Jetstar I was really worried about our flight. We had to check ourselves in via a kiosk and tag our own luggage and send it on its way. Having waited in an extremely long line before this innovation, it was actually a positive thing. We boarded efficiently, although by steps - and left right on time. The seat itself had reasonable leg room but was very narrow. We were lucky we had a free seat between us. The price seems initially cheap but when you add in things like seat choice, checked bag, any food it adds up to almost the price of a full service airline however, Jetstar is the only airline that flies direct from Melbourne to Townsville. We were not able to download any entertainment from their website as they don't allow this on this three hour flight. Made for a boring three hours, fortunately we had books to read. The flight attendants were very friendly, more so than any flight we have ever been on domestically or internationally - go figure. We had pre-ordered a Pho and ham and cheese toastie - mistake. They were not nice at all. I wish we hadn't done that. Anyway we arrived in Townsville 10 minutes early so that was a bonus. I would definitely choose this airline as it saves a lot of time when you can fly direct.",0
2017,"Jetstar was actually above what I expected flying from Melbourne to Townsville, but it started a little rough. We had driven for 1 hour in an uber to get to the airport and we had about five suitcases - on the check-in iPad, we had to check in each one of us individually which wasn't a big help. However, the experience got better once we boarded. The cabin crew were friendly and the plane was pretty clean, but the legroom was shocking. My knees were literally touching the seat in front! The Jetstar menu was good, with a decent range of food although a bit pricey. Toilets were spotless, surprisingly and the magazine was great. overall, Jetstar is a cheap and decent way to travel and I would love to return some day.",0
2017,"We are from Canada and planned to visit our daughter in Melbourne, Australia. We spent a week in Kona, Hawaii before heading to Australia on Qantas airlines (and they are worth every penny). Our daughter found us a return flight direct from Melbourne to Honolulu on Jetstar as we planned to rest up a few days there before heading back to Canada. Our flight was to leave at 3:50 pm on April 9 and get into Honolulu at 6:15 am. Allowing enough time to clear customs, we booked a flight from Honolulu to Kona at 10:01 am. My husband got up at 4:30 AM and checked his email where he had one from Jetstar advising our flight had been cancelled due to engineering problems. He waited in a long queue for an online chat to rebook, only to find out that they could get us on a flight on April 12 - three days later and would put us up in a hotel for 1 night. As we had island tours booked and paid for in Kona (we had booked on our earlier trip) we needed to get there on the original day we booked. They refunded us our money but would do nothing else to compensate us for the additional cost of flights - Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Honolulu, and change our flights from Honolulu to Kona. Believe me, there are no discounts when you book on the same day you travel so we incurred lots of additional costs. I can't review the actual flight because I have never flown on them, and never will.",1
2017,"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. This budget airline, Jetstar impresses me. The check in process was smooth and fast. Boarding was efficient. Ground crew and FAs were friendly, helpful and seem proud of their work. Plane took off and landed on time. No entertainment and food, typical of a budget airline but OK since it was only 40 minutes. Overall, a great flight.",0
2017,"Christchurch to Hobart via Melbourne. International flight and I wasn't aware how bare bones this flight was. The seat was worn and poking me in the back. They charged me an $160 for my bag from Christchurch to Melbourne and another $90 from Melbourne to Hobart. This was the same price as my ticket. My return flight is on Qantas (same price) and they are giving me free baggage. Flight also didn't include any drinks or food or any sort of entertainment. I'd say spend an extra $100 on a different flight and do not fly with this terrible company. Just scamming people. Plus, you shouldn't have to fly for 4 hours with such standards pend even more to take your bag.",1
2017,"Tokyo Narita to Sapporo. Before I was allowed to board the flight, my carry-on backpack was weighed. The size of my bag was not a problem but it was the weight of the bag. Jetstar's policy is to not allow carry-ons that weigh over 7 kgs. So, as to not have damage to my fragile MacBook or iPad, I had to carry them on with other items (iPhone, headphones, book, reading glasses) that I wished to use on the flight, juggling them in my arms as my backpack was checked in to the cargo hold. The staff treated me well and was apologetic, it's not their fault.",1
2017,"My daughter and I arrived two minutes after the flight had closed. We'd flown from Manchester on Emirates. The flight had been delayed by 3 hours so it was a miracle to get to check in at all. Although Jetstar have a rigid approach to late arrivals, I was impressed with the staff at Auckland airport who went out of their way to ensure that we were on the next available flight. Thanks so much. I would fly with Jetstar again!",0
2017,I was meant to get the 09:10 flight from Wellington to Auckland and then would have a 4 hour wait to catch an international flight back to the UK. I turned up at the airport just before 7am and was told the flight had been cancelled that morning and I'd have to go on standby for a flight that would arrive in Auckland at 12:50. I advised this would be impossible as I'd miss my international flight. After a lot of talking the lady of the checkin desk managed to get me on the standby flight that should have left at 08:35 but was late and eventually left at my originally scheduled flight time of 09:10. I had 5 mins to get to the gate and through security. I was grateful to get the flight but very unhappy with the lack of communication from Jetstar Airways leading to the cancellation of the flight. Lots of other passengers who also turned up for the cancelled flight stated they had not received any cancellation texts or emails. One person stated they received the message at approximately 5am. The plane itself had good leg room on the seats and the luggage came out promptly on arrival. I would hesitate using Jetstar Airways again.,1
2017,"Hong Kong to Singapore. I experienced awful customer service when I recently flew with Jetstar. Outside drinks weren't allowed on the plane despite the general terrible food served. Horrible attitude of staff on the ground. And in general, the policies around outside food and drinks are not clearly communicated. I would not recommend anyone to fly this airline, most definitely not families with little kids.",1
2017,"Perth to Bali. When booking my flight to Bali the Jetstar web site allocated seats to me which I did not change or select. Then when I printed out my invoice notice a seat selection fee. When I complained to Jetstar live chat agent, he said I should have unchecked the allocated seats so to avoid the fee. I think this is a terrible design and one could say made to trick customers in my view. Jetstar said my mistake was refundable and would do nothing to help. There is very little choice between AirAsia and Jetstar but one who likes to use local Jetstar was my choice. Well not anymore.",1
2017,"This airline is a shocker with little respect for their passengers. Booked to go to Sydney today for a 12.45 flight only to have it delayed until 2.50 with no explanation, and then went into a holding pattern for one hour at Sydney, only to be told that the airport was closed so we all had to return to Melbourne again. Once down we were told that there was no more flights until 3.30 Saturday afternoon which was the next day. Now I understand about the closure in Sydney but Qantas were still flying and landing at the time of our departure and indeed they were still flying that night but rather then make the effort to fly later that night they just cancelled everything leaving me needing to get to Sydney but unable, not to mention that when I asked for a refund they told me that I should have taken out travel insurance and it was not their responsibility: Until I questioned why Qantas was able to land and Jetstar wasn't they stated that Qantas have landing rights over everyone and indeed they were also flying that night they then paid up.",1
2017,"Auckland to Sydney. I do not recommend Jetstar if you want good customer service. I cannot comment on the actual flight as it hasn't happened yet, but I'm thinking I won't even be getting on the plane. I flew from Minneapolis to Auckland, visiting New Zealand on holiday before I start my working holiday visa in Australia. I do not have any solid travel dates but knew that I had to be in Australia by April 16th. I was told at the ticket counter that I could not board unless I had a flight out of New Zealand. This is my fault as I misunderstood the conditions of traveling into a country via visitor's visa vs. a working holiday visa. I was under the impression I could enter the country as long as I had enough money to purchase a flight out of the country. I had to book my flight at the ticket counter and fast since my flight was about to leave. I booked through kayak.com. I purchased insurance as I was under the impression I could use it to change or cancel my flight if I needed to. Apparently, kayak has their settings set to round trip by default and I accidentally booked a flight out of Auckland to Sydney on March 7th and then right back to Auckland from Sydney on March 8th in less than 24 hours. I noticed this mistake on my layover in Los Angeles and called the airline immediately to try and get a refund for the return ticket. Usually airlines will let you cancel of change your flight within 24 hours of the booking. Not Jetstar. They will do nothing to help me. I've talked to their customer service team about 4 or 5 times and they do not care about their customers. They won't even offer me a refund via voucher. The insurance I purchased to Allianz is a farce as well. The box I checked to purchase the insurance said it covered cancellations and changes to your flight. What they don't mention is that it only covers cancellations of changes if you or your travel companion is injured or ill and you must provide extensive proof of this. I will be contacting my bank to dispute all of the charges and I'm confident they'll get my money back. Jetstar will also be losing a customer.",1
2017,"Dunedin to Auckland. I was given plenty of warnings about JetStar but I still flew. I am happy to report service was great from the check in to baggage claim. The check in staff was friendly with a great sense of humor, boarding was smooth, and the cabin crew pleasant. I even got a sandwich, which is more than I received on my flight to Dunedin on Air New Zealand. The crew moved up and down the cabin many times being solicitous of our wellbeing. Compared to Air NZ domestic, JetStar is the star.",0
2017,"I am flying from Denpasar Bali to Melbourne on 21 January 2017 with Jetstar Airways. I was surprised with the flight. Low cost but they have audio video on demand. Free for general information, USB gadget charging, and headset. Pay for movies and music. Pay for meal and drink, but free for still water. Check in process running well. Good services from local staff. Then flights attendant is plain/fair. I think this flight exceeded my expectations.",0
2017,"Denpasar to Auckland via Melbourne. We left Denpasar airport a bit late due to several excuses, the main excuse was paperwork. We have already boarded the aircraft and waited on the ground for about an hour which made us miss our connecting flight to Auckland. Ground staff was a bit slow on giving us information about what was going on which made some of us very stressed and uncomfortable. The connecting flight that we were meant to be on had already left at 11.05pm when we arrived at 12am. Jetstar gave us accommodation and told us that we were on the next flight out which was at 9.10am but due to the immigration not giving us Indonesians visas we were unable to go to the hotel which meant we had to make ourselves comfortable in the transit area (which weirdly you had to call someone to open the door for you, it is so impractical when you are in a rush). We were given food vouchers worth $20 each (no shops were open at that time so we were starving). We were going to get our boarding tickets at the gate and the ground service were very aggressive and so unfriendly and rude which put us off so much. Overall, the cabin staff were alright but I've seen happier more friendlier cabin staff on other airlines. I recommend that Jetstar should really get their services to prioritise customers that have had disrupted flights and also train their staff to be more friendly and not so rude and aggressive. It would have made it more pleasant if the ground staff were more helpful and informative. Also on the flight from Auckland to Denpasar via Melbourne, our baggage had been left in Melbourne for around 3/4 days. Our baggage was meant to be checked in all the way through to Denpasar but obviously did this not happen. Not sure who to blame, Melbourne airport or Jetstar but this is really not a good way to start a holiday. We had to leave for Surabaya on the very next day we arrived in Denpasar which meant we had to drive 3 hours to the airport to claim our bags. We were stranded without clothes for 5 days.",1
2017,"Jetstar Airways flight from Melbourne - Narita delayed 3 hours. Flight was non-stop on an ok plane with proper facilities/seats/etc. Narita - Melbourne was a real pain. Our return was via Cairns. Queue at Narita horrendous. Few counters. 2 flights all queued up waiting. No bag drop. 1 hour or more to check-in here. Our flight had been changed from via Cairns to via Gold coast with no notification so all seats I had booked were lost and our family was unable to sit together. I didnt know this at time but the stopover in Gold Coast required us to clear customs, collect luggage, check-in again at Domestic terminal. Ended up in a very basic Airbus at the end of a long trip. Deposited at terminal 4 Melbourne which is close to 1km to walk to transport/parking buses. We were on a ski trip so had large luggage, having to collect and it and check it in 4 times plus haul it to main airport. Have never had to transfer my own luggage before on an international flight when i booked all the way through. I would not recommend this trip to anyone.",1
2017,"Jetstar Airways exceeded expectations and one of the best flying experiences I have encountered. We booked late and had to take the last two seats available - 1E and 2F. At check in we were told we mustn't sit apart and we were reassigned to 1G/J. Flight staff were friendly and efficient for the 5hr 30 minute journey - from orange juices prior to take off, to drinks after, food (which was excellent, by the way) and coffee and sweets a little later. IFE offered most of what Qantas offered - wide selection of films, tv, radio etc.",0
2017,"Sydney to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways. I bought this ticket for my family trip mainly because of it's price, and I expected the service will be not as good as the more ""regular airlines"", like Qantas. But overall, they've met my expections on the ""magazine only"" entertament system, tiny lavatory as well as the food and drink. But one thing that had exceeded my expections was the seat. The pitch was resonable for a domestic flight at 29 inches, fairly wide and the headrest was just as good as other airlines. Overall a great experience for the price.",0
2017,Adelaide to Denpasar. My first experience with Jetstar now set the crown on it. Checked in 1 bag of 12 kg at the airport because it is not possible online during check in processs = 160 AUD$. Confirmed seats for row 18 and ended up in row 30 (the last one) with no possibility to recline the seat on a 5 hour flight. Sitting in a bus is more comfortable and next to us was a huge garbage bag sitting on 2 seats! Customer service says that seats you are not paying for are not designated to you and can be changed at any time.,1
2017,"Flew Hobart to Sydney direct yesterday. Booked this flight as it was direct and left at a convenient time for us. We paid for a flexible ticket meaning we had baggage included, and could select our seats. Check in was easy - we were early to the airport but it was no dramas for them to send our bags off. No entertainment but only a 1 hour 45 min flight. Food and drink available for purchase but I had my own snacks. The exit row was comfy with extra leg room. Flight left only about 5 minutes late and arrived on time. Jetstar is fine for short haul domestic flights, I've never had any issues with them.",0
2017,"I booked a flight Perth to Melbourne to visit my sister, that flight was fine, and I had two very small bags with me, going and did not have to pay and check bags. But returning the we were all lining up to get on plane, and I was pulled to the side and my bag was weighed and it was 23 lbs for two bags, so I paid $50. To make matters worse, the was a lady behind me no credit cards, just cash, which they would not take, and they said you have to pay in order to get her bag on the flight. The lady was crying and the airline person did not care, airline policy she said, we only take credit cards only - so I paid for the lady. When getting on the plane there was lots of bins empty and empty seats. Once we were up in the air, the bar opens up and they said we take credit cards and cash to the nearest paper note cost of the drink. I have never seen this before.",1
