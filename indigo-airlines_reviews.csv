Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first. For ""Indigo"" Airlines, this is not the case will ""dump"" people onto the Bus and transport them from Gate to the Aircraft. In-Flight: Seating is congested, just like Auto-Rickshaw. The cabin crew is courteous and helpful. Landing: 30 Minutes late from their scheduled arrival. As a result, we had to spend another 30 Minutes at the HYD Airport for Immigration Officers' shift rotation. Overall DOH-HYD Experience is just a dump yard ride for me in Indigo Airlines. The journey from HYD to DOH, concerns starts with Check-In until the Landing. Nonetheless, this part of the journey is the most ""Interesting"" part of this review, don't miss it. Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code. Reached the Airport 4 hours before departure, Kids in arms and eight bags to check-in (opted porter service), had to stay in line for 1 hour 25 minutes to approach the check-in counter after repeated requests to follow the check-in code. Finally, at the check-in counter, the indigo staff was inclined to charge me 15k INR extra as my three bags had 1 kg extra and other bags had less than 23 kg allowed. Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight.

I recently had a flight from Mumbai to Maldives, for which the ticket fare was $159 for a one-way ticket. Still a little pricey, but not bad. The only reason why I took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the Maldives. After booking the ticket, I noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED.

Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport. It's now been 3 days, my bag is still in Delhi and IndiGo have no idea what's going on. They don't even know the right number to call at Delhi Airport to get an update.

Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future.

The boarding process was hurried as the crew tried to compensate for the delay which was much appreciated. The rest of the flight was pretty uneventful. However during de-boarding, the crew were polite and wished goodbye to me but not to everyone probably due to the fact that the crew were not expecting the rest of the passengers to thank them.

I immediately agreed to pay. Hence as per the baggage policy, I paid 400*10Kg -4000Rs. On arriving at Kochi airport after a 40-minute wait, I discovered that one of the luggage was lost and reported to the baggage claim representative. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, she cross-checked with the boarding pass and confirmed me that the bag of 10Kg is missing. I spoke to the indigo staff and have no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage. One of the senior officials of Indigo called me on June 9th and confirmed that the bag weight was 10Kg and a refund of 3500INR will be given. I expressed a complete dissatisfaction as I paid 4000Rs extra for the same bag. The staff promised me that he will check with the finance department and revert back.

We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on. But the crew instead of sending them back to their seat, make them sit in the first row, which is a paid row.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi,Istanbul,Doha,May 2019,1.0,2.0,,3.0,3,no,,,A321

While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board!

Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight.

On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls.

No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty.

indigo-airlines,254447,2014-02-20,1,Singapore,,IndiGo customer review,I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs.

It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,5.0,0.0,,5,yes,0.0,,

But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals.

The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment.

indigo-airlines,254393,2012-02-06,9,Australia,,IndiGo customer review,Kolkata-Chennai-Pune leg. The airline offers a very good product with excellent staff to go with it.

indigo-airlines,254394,2012-01-28,3,India,,IndiGo customer review,"Airline staff at Ahmedabad were unprofessional and non-committal. Flight to Bangalore from Ahmedabad scheduled at 5 pm was delayed more than 3 hours and the behaviour of ground staff was irresponsible. As the expected time neared and no trace of the aircraft was seen the answer I got from ground staff was ""we don't know"". Arrival at Bangalore airport was chaotic. It took ground staff more than 40 minutes to put the baggage on the carrousel. Passengers arriving on other airlines were exiting the terminal before our baggage was even on the carrousel. Indigo was my preferred airline until my previous trip - a very steep deterioration in quality.",,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no,,,
indigo-airlines,254395,2012-01-05,9,United Arab Emirates,,IndiGo customer review,BBI-DEL. Flight slightly delayed due to late departure at Delhi. Seated next to the exit no recline for the seat and the other passenger behind! Aircraft was clean although some parts broken. There were huge selections of snacks and beverages. Although the water comes in such a tiny glass you have to pay for it. Cabin Crew friendly and with a natural smile. Overall this airline is professional.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254396,2012-01-05,7,Germany,,IndiGo customer review,BOM-DEL-BOM. Boarding was swift and passengers greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight left on time and the service friendly with enough information was given by FA's. The flight on second leg was one hour late and IndiGo did manage to reach out passengers by sending SMS. Again friendly crew and clear information from FA's. The only downside is the food could be tastier. The food sold inflight has absolute no value of money and leg space is poor for an 188 cm man. I had to fit in and sit in slanting positing.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254397,2011-12-28,8,India,,IndiGo customer review,DEL-BKK on newly introduced international service by Indigo. Clean aircraft everything BOB on time and professional crew.

Pre-booking is there but the website does not guide as to how.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254399,2011-11-18,8,United States,,IndiGo customer review,Kolkata to Hyderabad. Check-in staff pleasant. Cabin crew professional and courteous. Aircraft clean but seats very tight.

indigo-airlines,254401,2011-06-23,10,India,,IndiGo customer review,BLR-DEL return trip. Had a good experience yet again. The flights took had a timely pushback.

Will surely continue flying Indigo.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254402,2011-02-17,8,India,,IndiGo customer review,Bombay-Jaipur return Pune-Nagpur. Easy check in and nice friendly staff in Bombay. On the return (Jaipur to Bombay) we were asked to carry no hand baggage onboard as it was a high security day. The airline could have informed us earlier as had breakable stuff in my hand baggage and they forced me to check it in. Pune to Nagpur efficient and competent crew.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254403,2011-02-04,9,United States,,IndiGo customer review,Connection at Madras to Hyderabad (coming from US) and back to Madras connecting to US. Both trips an hour long each.

Remembering yester-years of Indian Airlines service attitude it is amazing what the open market brought to traveling Indian public.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254404,2011-01-24,9,India,,IndiGo customer review,Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in DEL-BOM. An efficient airline which prides itself at being on time with helpful air and ground crews. New clean aircraft - just one grouse though a low cost carrier it would be great if the leg space was better. I am about 6 feet tall and it becomes uncomfortable in case of flights which are over an hour or so.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,

indigo-airlines,254406,2010-10-08,10,India,,IndiGo customer review,MUM-DEL. Excellent service - paid Rs300 for the front row which if you're my size is worth it! Inflight food is on a pay basis nothing special but it's good size portions and not bonkers expensive. Great inflight crew cheerful and engaging brand new planes. My first choice now for domestic Indian flights.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,

indigo-airlines,254410,2010-07-04,8,India,,IndiGo customer review,Kolkata to Guwahati and Kolkata to Bangalore. Check-in okay not too friendly. Aircraft were new so cabins kept clean. Seats okay. Cabin crew better than ground crew. Cheap tickets. The only complaint is that the food is expensive - INR 150 for chicken sandwich is too much considering it's just a 2 piece sandwich which you can get for INR 50 at super-markets. The great thing about IndiGo is the on-time performance.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254411,2010-06-30,6,India,,IndiGo customer review,Kolkata-Jaipur route on time clean aircraft and nice crew. One bad thing about this airline is that they do not even serve water at free. Snacks were expensive outside foods are allowed.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254412,2010-06-29,9,India,,IndiGo customer review,DEL-CCU-DEL. Full flight outbound but seated in front row which was good. No queues at checkin nice crew cheerful and professional. Flight left on time and landed early - baggage was off within a few minutes wait. Coming back slightly less good check in experience - at airport several hours early after arriving in international - wouldn't let us check in until 2 hours before departure. When asked for front row seats were told we'd have to pay - got it free on outbound guess I was lucky! Flight crew again cheerful and attentive. Flight was early again bags took about 20 mins but that's par for the course in Delhi. Inflight food not paid and ok value for money.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,
indigo-airlines,254413,2010-06-08,8,United States,,IndiGo customer review,BDQ-HYD via BOM. The check-in at Vadodara was smooth though they did not give me through check in to Hyderabad.
