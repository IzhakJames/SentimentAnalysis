After landing in NRT, I found that everything in my baggage was wet and the outside of the suitcase was wetter than the inside, indicating that liquid had entered from the outside. I contacted Zipair via email to ask for compensation. However, ZIPAIR is not compensating me; they only provided a document for me to submit to insurance.

2024-02-17,4,Philippines,Not Verified,"""can’t they be a little bit more lenient"" ","It is my first time to fly with ZIPAIR and knowing that it was a budget airline i didn’t really have high expectations. So when we came in the person on the counter asked us to put all our hand carry luggages all together, there are 3 of us so we should have 21kgs in total. It initially was 28kg all together which was way too much so we had to put the rest of our stuff inside the checked in luggages and then when we reweigh after it was 24kg. She still didn’t allow and wants us to remove more stuff so we opened our luggages again in front of the counter and transfered more stuff. I asked if we could just checked in 1 bag but she said since we only paid for 2 checked in luggages we can only check in 2 bags as well. So finally after the 3rd try it was now 20.8kg. Then it was finally time to weigh the 2 checked in luggages. I paid for x2 30kg luggages which in but ours in total was only 38kgs.  I mean can’t they be a little bit more lenient with the luggages i know there are policies but it just doesn’t make sense to me at all. I just don’t understand why they have to be so strict with the hand carry luggages when there were so much weight left with our checked in luggages anyway. And They both go on the same plane? What was weird for me too was that they weighed our hand carry first before the checked in luggages which was a first for me.

One passenger could sleep over the entire row as there were 2 empty seats next to her. When we asked why she could occupy 3 seats when no change of seats was allowed the air stewardess loudly declared she is sick.

Yes, we were one of the last people. Our luggage was not by our seat, so we needed to wait for others to leave first. I used to travel 4-6 times a year. I used many different airlines. But, it was my first time being asked to leave soon.  Wifi connection was disconnected multiple times. Low quality and poor connection. No free meal:  No screen and movies: That's okay. As long as I have WIFI connection. The selection of movies was out-dated. Extra cost for check-in luggage: You pay more for heavier luggage. That's okay it is still money-saving.

2023-11-04,2,United States,Trip Verified,"""rudest person I have come across""","I flew ZIPAIR from LAX in Los Angeles to Narita airport in Japan on 11/1. I had arrived a few minutes after the one-hour boarding deadline had passed. To my surprise, the friendly counter lady was able to check me in along with my two luggage cases and said I was fine with being a few minutes late. Obviously it wasn't my goal to be a few minutes late, but crazy traffic at LAX was the issue here even though I left my home 3 hours before my flight. The flight was smooth with no turbulence and the food was pretty decent. The movie library is pretty limited (only 9 movies), but enough to pass the time. The nightmare started to happen during my next leg of the trip (flight purchased separately) which was departing on 11/4 at 8:55AM from Narita airport in Japan to Incheon airport in Seoul. I had arrived at the check-in counter at around 7:53AM and was concerned about the one-hour boarding deadline. The counter lady was busy assisting another individual, and my wife and I were the last in line to be checked-in. The lady finished the other individual around 7:58AM and as I was heading to speak with her, she said I could not board because the hour deadline had passed. As you can imagine, I was livid and told her that it wasn't my fault she took so long to assist the passenger before me. I said it was not my fault as I had arrived at the line before 7:55AM. We had several back and forth encounters as you can imagine I am out several hundred dollars and she told me I had to book another flight since there were no more ZIPAIR flights leaving Narita that day. She was not helpful at all as I asked how to inquire for a refund. She said you'll get the taxes back. I then asked how do I do that? She said to contact customer service. I asked how do I do it? She said there's no phone number, you'll need to email them. I literally had to ask her questions by piecemeal. This was by far the rudest person I have come across after traveling to Japan several times this year.

The main problem is they are too strict about carryon bag weight, it has to be less than 7kg. Everyone was slow to check in because their carry on bag was ""too heavy"" and they had to stuff more things in their checked bag (i had to as well). The person working there was nice enough to eventually give up and let me just take a normal amount of carryon with me instead of continuing to try and get it down to 7 pounds. the workers at narita airport check in seemed earnest and happy.

It took a total of about 10 minutes from the time I walked into Tom Bradley terminal to check in and go through security. The seat was exactly what you would get on Japan Airlines business class just without anything extra. If you want anything beyond a great lay flat seat, you do have to pay, but I knew all this since it is pretty clear on their website so I downloaded some TV shows to my laptop, brought my own food and everything was fine.

2023-09-19,1,United States,Trip Verified,"""being periodically harassed and ridiculed""","My review lays with being periodically harassed and ridiculed about an extension seat belt. Being that I am a plus size woman, I already came prepared and brought/bought my own seat belt extender that fit and connected the first flight to Narita no issues about the seat belt extender, however, there were still multiple times of being awaken out my sleep to pull an arm rest down or not have anything in my lap. Back to the initial complaint, on flight ZG026 to San Francisco on 9/18/23. I got to my seat and I over heard the flight attendants that did not wear name badges, speaking in Japanese about of have to make sure the fat lady has a seat belt extender. This the behavior you allow for your company. Then one comes up to me and pulls the seat belt and extends it then says you need an extender. Not ask but stated that I needed one. Still remaining calm I told her I already have one of my own and proceed to click it to get her smoothly. She leaves and talk with the previous attendant that was talking bad about me and comes back saying it’s not safe for me to use my own seatbelt extender belt. Then shoves theirs in my hand and says be sure to give this back at the end of flight and stayed until I removed mine and connected theirs to the seat belt. The attendant walks off says something else that I could not fully hear but definitely heard I’m going to mark her seat down so she doesn’t steals it to the previous attendant they both laugh. I proceeded to state I really don’t need this extension belt and you two are making me uncomfortable and we haven’t even taken off. They lie and says it’s policy and then walk off. Fast forward to 2/3 of the flight nearly ending the same attendant wakes me out of my sleep to tell me don’t forget to leave the extension belt in the seat when I leave. I calmly say ok even though I am boiling because of the assumption of assuming that I’m going to steal a extension belt extender, then when we land and the seatbelt light is off. I took off the seat belt and detached everything and left in the seat. The same harassing attendant comes up to me and demands I give her the seatbelt extender. I reach behind me and get it for her and said I thought you wanted me to leave it in the seat but please do take note that you have it back in your hands. Because I am not a thief and do not appreciate being harassed like one. I wish they had name plates so I can post it in this review. Lounge in narita was ok, the white seats are extremely stained and there’s no restroom inside it.

2023-04-28,9,United States,Trip Verified,"""thoroughly content with my experience""","First off, I’m not a picky flyer by any means. I only get up from my seat to stretch occasionally and always bring my own entertainment options, no matter what is offered in-flight. I don’t need a lot of space or amenities to be content, even though I’m not a small guy. That was the initial attraction to ZIPAIR for me, not paying for things I wasn’t going to use. Entertainment? Bring your own (every seat has a USB-A charging port and they allow power banks, so don’t sweat the electrons). Meals, snacks, and drinks? Offered, but must be paid for separately either before you board, or in-flight via a browser interface using the plane’s WiFi system. Honestly, fine with me. I brought my own snacks and water on board, and used WiFi to order some drinks. The flights were incredibly smooth, the cabin staff were a vision of professionalism and care, the planes were spotless, and the seat comfort was better than expected despite being in Economy. For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty. Honestly, these are relatively minor complaints (especially WiFi, hardly a necessity), and I feel these in no way diminished the value of what I saved on my fare. To sum up: I kept my expectations simple, and was thoroughly content with my experience flying with ZIPAIR. I will be using them again the next time I go to Japan.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose,Tokyo,,April 2023,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,,3.0,Boeing 787-8

These seats are marketed as Business Class 'Lite' i.e.. you are getting a flat bed seat but not much else for the ticket price. However, I would actually rate the experience with Zip on this flight from Tokyo to Singapore more highly than my experiences with other airlines such as British Airways, who constantly disappoint. The value for money is way better that's for sure. As is the customer service. In summary: Check in process could have been better. Had to wait in queue for about half an hour. I think all passengers are required to manually check in at a desk for this flight. Or at least we were on this occasion. No fast track for business class. On the flight itself, the seats were very comfortable. The blanket provided was especially nice. As were the slippers. The restrooms were very clean and the toiletries provided were ample. Things like mouthwash, hand cream, etc. The staff were excellent. Polite, attentive, courteous. The food was good for what it was. I had spicy chicken with rice. It was basically a microwave meal but still tasty. The fruit was fresh and flavoursome. Free Wi-Fi for business class. Although this is a given on most premium seats, there are still airlines who cash in on charging for Wi-Fi (British Airways for example), so its nice that Zip provide it for free.

It was a great start but were concerned about seat comfort and inflight Wifi. As we entered the plane we realized seat comfort was not an issue. The seats were a clean, comfortable leather and had more leg space than most American carriers. Once we got in the air the Wifi connected quickly so we could access email and order food. It's not strong enough to download movies or tv shows so do that before you board. Food options are limited, they run out quick if you don't preorder. I suggest eat early or bring your own food. Beverages were comparably priced with other airlines and it didn't seem to run out of any drinks. The inflight staff was very attentive and kept trash out of the aisles and seat backs the entire flight. Our return trip from Tokyo to San Francisco was exactly the same.

Passengers are required to show their boarding pass during flight to verify the optional upgrade. The tasty meal came in a box on a tray, with just beef and rice next to bottled water. There was no salad, dessert nor other drink, But the free Wi-Fi connected to my smart phone allowed ordering drinks and snacks later, as well as compensating for having no seatback screen. The charming cabin attendants were very safety conscious, double-checking to make sure overhead bins were closed securely. ZipAir should be commended for creating a unique budget flying experience on lengthy international flights. Some earlier negative Skytrax reviews were based on unmet pandemic regulations and refund policies, not the flights themselves, Overall, I highly recommend ZipAir as an alternative to traditional carriers whose fares have skyrocketed on the HNL-NRT route since the pandemic, Just follow the their common sense rules and enjoy the money saved.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu,Tokyo Narita,,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,3.0,4.0,Boeing 787

Lost over 1000$ due to this discrepancy and inability to transfer in Japan, and misinformation.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok,Tokyo,,June 2022,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,
2022-06-01,1,Australia,Trip Verified,"""Avoid at all costs""","Avoid at all costs. I booked flights to go from Singapore to Tokyo and due to unforeseen circumstances I have been really unwell and aren’t allowed to fly. I reached out to zipair and advised the situation and the medical advise I was given. I requested a voucher or refund and will fly with them again when i can. The operator advised I would be only receiving $50 (AUD) from a $550 (AUD) refund because HQ would give anything else (exact words) I was dumbfounded that that was the response. Not even with a medical certificate would they assist with situation. I am out of pocket $500 due to something I have no control over. I wish i could honestly fly with them, Its a planned holiday but I am physically unable. Really disappointing from an airline trying to build again",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore,Tokyo,,June 2022,,,,,1,no,,,
2022-05-31,3,Japan,Trip Verified,"""Will not recommend to anyone""","Flight was leaving at 23.15 and after an hour and a half flying had to get back to airport due to a medical emergency of a passenger. Upon landing we were left inside the plane in the tarmac until 4:15 am and told to deplane and pick up our luggage and flight would be cancelled. Zipair did not take responsibility for the passengers and just left everyone to sort themselves out at 5am, even families with small children,  their reply was “oh, there are many hotels in Bangkok”. When these situations have occurred to me always airline took to hotel, specially once we had already left ground. They didnt offer anything at all at the time… Flight was rescheduled for the next day at the same time.. upon checking in at 10pm or so, they offered a meal voucher of 300THB as compensation… couldn't they have given the voucher in the morning and not just an hour before leaving.

2022-05-23,6,Japan,Trip Verified,"""It was immaculately clean""","Zipair is JAL’s budget airline. They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasn’t enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping. Is that worth $5.5k - only you can answer that.",Business,Business Class,Tokyo,Los Angeles,,May 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5,yes,2.0,5.0,Dreamliner
2022-05-20,1,United States,Trip Verified,"""lost all of our money with no refund""","They lied about connection in Narita and we lost all of our money with no refund. They have no agreements with any connecting airlines to transfer you once in Narita, hence they denied boarding and did not offer a refund. Nor did they advise of such at purchase. Lost $1000 with this airline.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore,Tokyo,,May 2022,,,,1.0,1,no,,,
