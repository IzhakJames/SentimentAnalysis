2024-03-15,10,Malaysia,Trip Verified,"""very pleased with experience""","I am representing a party of 5 seniors traveling from Medan back to Kuala Lumpur after a 4D3N tour on Mar 14/24, and we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Mr Ruly (Guest Service Officer) of Air Asia at the Medan International Airport Checkin counter desk. Mr Ruly was very pleasant and polite , and quickly booked us a flight back to KL the same day , after our flight on Batik Airline was suddenly cancelled without notice. He went out of his way to help us obtain a flight cancellation letter from Batik Airline at the airport. Further he also helped us saved money in advising us that we could combine the weights of all our check-in luggage, so our overall ticket cost is cheaper. It is not often that you meet nice people like this, especially one who is efficient and served with a warm smile. Our flight back to KL was pleasant, and we arrived 25 mins ahead of schedule! Again not many airlines can match this. Overall we were all very pleased with experience.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Medan,Kuala Lumpur,,March 2024,5.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,,,,

Uninterested staff who were very unaccommodating. Flew back to Perth on QZ534. Even worse experience as I travelled back with my husband and child. We were separated and yet there were several free seats available. We asked if we could sit together as we had a 1 year old with us. They said the plane was full and yet there were several seats available. At the end of the trip I asked to help my husband with the bags as he was carrying the baby. They refused to let me and said I couldn't go back on the plane. They then stood around and watched him struggle to carry the bags and the baby instead of offering to help.

However, when I arrived at the airport, the airline informed me that there are issues with my payment and I need to purchase another ticket, which, of course, costs more. When I called my bank, they confirmed once again that my payment was indeed successful. The airline suggested that I buy another ticket now and request a refund later when I return. I am extremely frustrated for several reasons: - The airline provided incorrect information by sending me letters assuring that everything was okay, but it turned out not to be the case at the airport. The payment I made was successful, as confirmed by the bank. Why didn't the airline refund the money if the payment wasn't successful? Why should I pay more for another ticket when I already paid for the same booking?

Not only do they have no live customer service agents to assist with any issues, but when their systems fail, there is absolutely no recourse for the stranded passengers. I was left stranded at the airport with no way of reaching anyone for help, and it was a nightmare trying to get any sort of assistance. It's absolutely unacceptable for an airline to operate in this manner, and I believe they should be held criminally liable for essentially stealing money from their customers. If you cannot provide the service you charged for and you do not have a live person to resolve issues with you airlines you are not operating a business.

Spoke to a couple of other passengers and noticed they are the same flight as me, and machine also stated late and hence unable to luggage drop despite them being there way earlier than 1hr before departure. When queue reaches our turn, its 11.45pm. Counter customer service stated too late, cannot luggage drop. We were told to wait for this flight to depart first, then try to request customer service for change to another flight and pay the difference. That sounds ridiculous because the other passengers are ""late"" because AirAsia's own ticketing system has a problem and everyone was asked to queue until they missed the closing time for dropping luggage. I gave my luggage to my wife who drove me here and ran all the way to the departure gate. I arrived at the departure gate at 12.10pm. On the way, custom informed me that system shows I cannot board but I can try. Tried I did. To my surprise, the plane is not there yet at the departure gate when I arrived. This means Airaasia could have helped, but they simply refuse. When I tried to reason to the counter at the departure gate, all I get told was I was late. There is no sense of logic in the heads of these customer service agents. In any case, it is now 1.25pm whilst typing this review. 60 minutes delayed with no notice on estimated delay duration. There are the elderly, and kids here and they just don't seem to be bothered. When queried what is the policy for flight delay and possible cancellation, he says 2 hours first, then denies saying it back and forth. Very unprofessional and unreliable customer service. The flight status board now shows another flight, and my flight just simply gets removed without notice, causing alot of passengers crowding at the desk asking what is going on. For reference, we take AirAsia because it is cheaper sometimes. So we understand and do not complaint if it delays a little here and there.

I was struggling to get the weight just right for them and a security guard noticed me struggling and whispered to me to just take out my laptop from my carry-on baggage because then AirAsia won't count it as carry-on weight if I only take out my laptop and carry it by hand.

I mean, how do people who make money through these days extremely cheap and disgusting ways sleep at night? It’s a 9 year old child.

Other than the Air Asia low price on promotion is attractive, you'll not surprise if you heard any bad feedback comment about how AA disappointing customer. I'm not the first one and I believe will not be the last one. How AA Customers support system fooling customer around? It must be a platform to train your patience. AA customer support system has 4 ways to contact Air Asia which are Live chat (24/7), call centre, Twitter(24/7) and e-form. I have tried 4 of them: Live chat (24/7): it has been removed - 26 Dec 2018 URL No Longer Exists You have to wait for average 1 hour on live chat queue to say hi to a live chat staff. If you miss the screen when the conversation started, you will kick out from the chatroom by livechat staff, when you check back the screen, it showed ""thank you for contacted live chat"". You have to wait for another one hour. Live chat staff could simply end your conversation without your notice, so even your question not yet finish,you will be kicked out by the staff again. Call centre: I have called to call centre from Malaysia at RM2 per minute! I wanted to buy/add-on/upgrade my baggage to 25kg (3 days before my flight), but it is no longer available on ""modify"" at the airasia homepage. The only way is you have to call them (yes waste time + money), otherwise it would me RM45/kg (not sure they increase the price or not) at the check-in counter. waiting time: generally 10 minutes. Twitter (24/7) the so-called ""24/7"" Twitter service is totally a lie. You can tweet them 24/7, but they will only reply to you immediately, most of the time a few hours or few days. (tweet them for 5 months due to my lost bag case). When the staff is free they will tell you Please wait for the investigation or there's not much they can do, please contact live chat/call/e-form. Live chat, twitter and call centre will push all the responsibility to e-form. Ask you to contact e form. E-form has annoyed and wasted my time the most. It took few days/about 1 month to reply to you, they could just reply sorry that they have done their best and simply closed the case straight after. I've created the same case for 3 times because the staff closed my case without solving my problem, but it is written in the email that my case has been solved, or you didn't reply the email within 7 days. Here comes the tactic: at first you can still contact the AA staffs, but after 3-4 emails, suddenly your reply cannot reach to the AA support team and this will end up case closed because the system shows that you didnt reply to the AA email. When you reply, a no reply email message will tell you that your case has closed, if you need any assistant, please send an e form again! I strongly advise you be aware when you book the AA ticket. The price is really attractive, but please make sure you add on all the bag, meal etc. For the locals, I suggest you check also the price from Malaysia Airlines, Fireflyz and Malindo.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur,Singapore,,March 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1.0,1.0,,

They promised us that they would provide Vegetarian food on the flight. But when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. I really will not recommend this AirAsia to anyone. While going to Bali from Mumbai, one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with AirAsia is different. Generally 1 INR = 210 IDR(app). But with Air Asia, 1 INR = 100 IDR.

We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldn’t a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for “express handling”. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1 ½ hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority – everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal.

The ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. The chairs are quite uncomfortable, when it was time for landing, I didn't even realize my seat was reclined. Many of the passengers used their cell phones at inappropriate times which made me very uncomfortable.

I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money.

Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others.

I tried to call and after a wait of over 100 minutes, the call was answered. I was cut off by their agent. Infuriating and an absolute disgrace and contempt for their passenger. A wait of this length says it all about their attitude. Wait long enough so you hang up? The problem then goes away? I emailed 6 weeks ago and am still waiting for a reply. I had to book again and lose the first flight for both of us. Why do AirAsia not allow minor changes within a set time, say 12/24 hours? Not have a proper customer service centre that will call you back if wait times are over, say fifteen minutes or reply to your email?

The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all.

Flying with two adults, an infant on lap and a two year old child. At airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination, but couldn't print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. Eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us.

I've flown Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, Singapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai to Singapore, Jakarta to Yogyakarta, and the Singapore/Jakarta route several times.

Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead. Overall, i recommend Air Asia whenever you're looking for basic service to get you where you have to go quickly and cheaply.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN,CGK,,December 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,4.0,,,A320

Waited an hour before the operator repeated that the flight was cancelled but I told him there were other agents selling the ticket. He repeated the instructions of the email. I had also bought my hotel accommodations from Airasia and asked if I could cancel the entire trip. The operator could only cancel my flight and my hotel booking cannot be cancelled (my hotel cost more than the flight)! I asked what if I want to come back on the 3 Jan because my friend cannot apply for any leave. I was basically told that was my problem. Left without any real options, I requested a refund for my flights back from KL. My friend bought a new ticket from SQ returning on 2 Jan for less than S$100 and I return on 5 Jan for a ticket that was less than S$50.

2015-08-04,1,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,"This review is for the return trip from Bangkok to Gold Coast via KL. On the way over we flew an overnight flight. It was the coldest flight I have been on. Even with boots, jumper, scarf and our own blanket we were cold. When we arrived at the Gold Coast, the outside air temperature was 16 degrees - that felt warm. Moreover the lights were left on until very late (approx. 2.5 hrs after take off) and turned on very early (approx. 3 hrs before landing). We had very little time for sleeping. In conclusion, it was the most uncomfortable flight we have traveled on. On the return trip, we were notified via email around 3.40 am that the flight was about 3 hour delayed, however we left home at 5am and had not checked our email so we were not aware of the delay. When we arrived at the airport we tried to ask staff to issue us a Boarding pass for the next available connecting flight to Bangkok from KL as we knew we would miss our originally booked flight. However we were told they could not do that but she assured us that Air Asia staff in KL would be able to get us a flight to Bangkok that evening. When we arrived at KL we (and other passengers who missed their connecting flights) were made to wait at the transit desk for around 40 mins before we were notified that all of us had to stay overnight in KL and fly the next day. In the end we gave up realising that nothing could be done, we had no other choice but to fly the following morning.

We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters.

2015-06-04,1,India,,AirAsia customer review,Air Asia India: Traveled from Delhi to Bangalore on May 23rd. One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,1.0,,1,no,1.0,1.0,,

The first five rows are reserved for anyone who buys the premium seats (I think it cost about 10 bucks) and they were mostly empty on both flights so I was able to lay down and sleep across the second row. I pre-booked a meal for a few dollars and it was pretty good. Only complaint is they bus you to the plane from the terminal so boarding is a bit hectic.

We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable.

2015-04-03,7,Canada,,AirAsia customer review,"I have flown many flights with Air Asia and Air AsiaX over the past few years. I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations. But always compare ""all in"" is an advertising pitch leaving you to find it.",,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,,3,no,4.0,1.0,,

Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport.

2014-12-10,3,United Kingdom,,AirAsia customer review,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it.

Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing.

Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,2.0,,1,no,1.0,1.0,,
2014-11-20,7,United Kingdom,,AirAsia customer review,"12th Nov 2014. Flight: AK139 Hong Kong (1050 dep) to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2). This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced and I would pre-book meals with them in future.

Having been a regular AA and AAX flyer since 2006 we knew what to expect - value for money. Our expectations were kept at a reasonable level and once again we were not disappointed. Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude. A few ground staff at the old LCCT had a poor command of English.

I chose a lunch time flight so we could use a taxi to the airport easily. Check in was quick and the flight went on time. The pre-booked meals were all as expected. Seats were free up the back and we were allowed to use them and spread out. Arrival at KLIA2 was easy as we'd used the airport before. Air Asia offers a great product.

This is unusual even with the short flights I have taken with Air Asia as well as some other business class flights.

2014-11-03,8,United States,,AirAsia customer review,5 October 2014 FD315 and D7 222. I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats. I will definitely fly AirAsia business class for an overnight flight again as long as it is affordable for me.,,Business Class,,,,,3.0,5.0,,5,yes,4.0,4.0,,
2014-11-03,9,Australia,,AirAsia customer review,My wife and I flew from Sydney to Kuala Lumpar and then on to Phuket with Air Asia in business class albeit the KL to Phuket sector did not have any business class - which we had been warned about prior to the trip so this was no surprise. We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer. As far as value for money goes I could not have wished for a better experience. We will certainly use this airline again where possible.,,Business Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,,5,yes,3.0,3.0,,

Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline but the seat does all the work thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class.

2014-11-03,10,New Zealand,,AirAsia customer review,D7206 24 October 2014. This was our first Business Class flight experience with Air Asia and it exceeded all our expectations. Because it is a No Frills Airline we were not expecting a full service. We made our meal selection at the time of booking. We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment. The seats however are as good as you would hope to find in any full service business class. Fully lie flat and with the full size pillow and duvet supplied we enjoyed a good sleep for almost the entire flight. Would I chose this again?

I booked well in advance for a trip to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur and am a frequent flyer with Aisr Asia so am aware of the restrictions for the excellent price and service which is provided. I would have liked to have been informed that there was no Business Class Lounge at Kuala Lumpur airport and also it would have helped if they had given us some idea of the great distance between Gates. I cannot fault their service at the desks through the Gates and on the aircraft.

The cabins are fresh and clean. Crew is efficient and accommodating. So when the fares are reasonable I see no reason not to give AirAsia top marks. It helps that DMK although it looks a bit outdated is more efficient than BKK by far.

At check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26. For a fee they could change seats - this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row.

2014-10-20,1,Australia,,AirAsia customer review,"We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat.

Another bug I have with Air Asia is that they do not notify passengers of flight changes dates etc. They simply change itineraries and let passengers find out themselves. I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore. Scoot are far more reliable and a similar price ex Sydney. Once my pre-booked flights for 2015 are used it's bye bye to Air Asia for me.

However the flight itself was smooth and efficient getting us to KL on time. As it was such a quick flight there was no time for inflight entertainment or food & beverages.

If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin. They are punctual good value food wed upgrade our luggage and seat when you book and crew are always pleasant. Petty comments about no entertainment on a 1 or 2 hour flight takes some beating.

2014-09-17,2,Singapore,,AirAsia customer review,Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,2.0,,4,no,4.0,1.0,,

On all occasions check in was quick and efficient with clear direction given boarding spoken in English seat allocation and comfort fine with ample space for the short haul flights FA's were well presented with good command of English flights all left on time food and beverage acceptable with good pricing compared to other budget airlines no IFE but most people talked to their partner the old fashion way of communication which made the flight seem short.

2014-09-06,6,Czech Republic,,AirAsia customer review,Praya/Lombok to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2) as a HiFlyer. I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.,,Premium Economy,,,,,4.0,2.0,,4,yes,4.0,1.0,,
2014-09-06,9,Singapore,,AirAsia customer review,AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing.

2014-08-28,1,Switzerland,,AirAsia customer review,Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off.,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,1.0,,1,no,1.0,1.0,,

2014-08-15,5,Australia,,AirAsia customer review,"Premium/Business class in the month of August KL - Seoul Busan - KL. Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage.

There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor.

2014-06-30,8,United States,,AirAsia customer review,Flew Air Asia in June 2014 from Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. The Surat Thani airport is very small you go down an escalator and walk onto the tarmac to board the plane. The plane boarded on-time and very quickly. The flight staff were still vacuuming when I boarded! They boarded the plane quickly and had an easy departure and easy landing. The distance between seats is really small. I am not a big person but these seats are very close! They do recline but not much. Not very comfortable for a long flight but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though. I paid extra for a seat assignment one piece of luggage and a chicken dinner. Total came to around $2600 Bhat which is about $80 USD. For a short flight it was fine although the seats are not very comfortable.,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,4.0,,4,no,4.0,1.0,,

However the second one put us into SGN too late to make our connecting flight on to DAD. As soon as we landed in BKK I went to the Air Asia help desk and explained my problem. BTW This is a Thai Air Asia flight. The 2 young staff members couldn't have helped me more. They understood my problem and did a great job fixing it. I've flown them several times and they're a first class low fare carrier. When they charge you for food and drinks on board it's at a reasonable amount. They now only operate out of Don Muang (DMK) but there is a free shuttle between DMK and BKK airport.

However two weeks ago received an email from Air Asia stating that my return KUL-PER flight 26 May has been cancelled - 'for commercial reasons'. Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'.

On the return flight 5 days later the cabin crew failed to notice 3 extremely drunk passengers who I guess were automatically allocated online emergency exit seats! When I told the cabin crew about this they asked them to move and one of the crew later thanks me.

I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing.

As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic!

The DMK-CSX boarding was delayed because staff were not at the gate at departure time. We were informed that they had been busy with another gate and thus no staff were available for our gate. The boarding thus became messy although we managed to get through because of our priority boarding seat privilege. On the return flight our group consisted of 13 persons with 4 booking codes. We were told to check-in as a group and we were the first group to check in at the counter. Our queue however was overtaken by another tour group. We had to ""protest"" in order to have our queue maintained. Check-in was slow and rather inefficient and we were informed that it is because the staff are new.

When I picked myself up off the floor I asked the desk person if I could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. Told to go to the website check in online and 'pre-register' my bag online. The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look.

Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor.

The airline changed the flight number causing great confusion and inconvenience for all passengers. No embarkation cards were also given out on board which is a normal procedure with all airlines. Air Asia maybe a budget airline but this does not give it a right to do what they want and as they please. Terrible experience.,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,1.0,,1,no,2.0,1.0,,

2014-01-07,7,Singapore,,AirAsia customer review,We travelled from Singapore to Krabi by Airasia Thailand on 29th December 2013. I have to say that I am not pleased with the punctuality of the airline. We were delayed as the flight arrived 20 minutes late from Krabi. Delayed again on the way back to Singapore. However the flight was smooth and seats were comfortable for a low cost carrier. A strange incident happened as we were approaching the terminal in Singapore. We were all ready to leave the aircraft when the pilot announced that we would push back to another gate. The process itself took another 30 minutes. So overall we were delayed by over an hour.

2014-01-06,7,South Korea,,AirAsia customer review,"Air Asia Indonesia. KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays. The first was due to arriving aircraft (two hours) and the second was due to ATC in SIN (boarded on time but one hour delay on the plane). The seats were comfortable for the short flights. The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap sure but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting. For our flight KUL-CGK there was no announcement of any delay until after the scheduled departure time (but they kept making announcements for other delays).

There was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase - only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. The flight was freezing cold and I had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in ""hot"" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude. The flight attendants speak little English. They are careless. I think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as Qantas Economy.",,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,1.0,,1,no,1.0,1.0,,

2013-12-06,1,India,,AirAsia customer review,It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. Everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. Your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft.

I was also happy to have paid for the meet and greet option as there were long check-in queues at 05.00 with 3 Air Asia flights departing early. No queue for me right to the front and then assisted with passport control and led to the business lounge (the lounge was pretty poor not Air Asia's fault). Crew were young polite and efficient.

2013-10-25,1,United States,,AirAsia customer review,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water.,,Premium Economy,,,,,2.0,1.0,,3,no,2.0,1.0,,

Flights on time aircraft very clean check-in at both airports very efficient. Airline food on way out OK but way back actually very good for an airline hot meal (roast chicken and thai green curry options for the return flight).

2013-08-26,9,United Kingdom,,AirAsia customer review,Flew 4 times back in May 2013 as they are no doubt the major low-cost airline in Asia. One is DMK-PHN and another one is DMK-HKT. Both are returned flight. Good move by Thai AirAsia for choosing DMK as their hub - less hassle and easy to get to. Check-in was easy and it is how you talk with the check-in staff in order to get seat you want/close to your partner/friend. I flew with my fiancé so we did manage to get the seat we want by just talking your way through. Aircraft is a new A319 which was a complete step-up from their old B737 a couple years ago I flew with them.

Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes.

Had exit row hot seats for 1st leg and they were great so much leg room. Cabin staff also enforced the seats with people trying to move in to the empty row in front of us and all were removed. Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy. I think if I was taking anything longer than 2 hours I would pay for the exit row. 3rd leg Phuket airport showing its age and in dire need of a revamp. but again no issues with TAA on arrival used jet way and bags arrived quickly.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
2013-05-23,10,United Kingdom,,AirAsia customer review,Jakarta - Singapore on Friday on the 17.30 using the Red Carpet service was an enjoyable experience. Check-in was prompt and efficient and the lounge used basic but comfortable. One issue is that I had to pay for a beer which was poor as it's included in KL. A very efficient member of staff took my passport away and processed it with immigration which was good. I was accompanied through to the Departure Lounge and even accompanied across the tarmac before everyone else. Aircraft clean and comfortable and cabin crew very professional. Visited Air Asia in Changi re. complaint from my SIN-CGK flight in Red Carpet without lounge access offered in Changi - it'll be interesting to see if I ever get a reply or refund!,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,,5,yes,0.0,0.0,,
2013-05-22,,Cambodia,,AirAsia customer review,"I am en route back from Singapore to Phnom Penh with Air Asia after learning much to my disgust what Air Asia means by ""point to point"" service. I flew from Yangon to Singapore and expected - to be able to get a boarding pass from Yangon to Singapore and check my bags through. I am an experienced traveler and fly constantly. When I landed in KL I was to my surprise required to go through immigration and customs in Kuala Lumpur pick up my bag check through the confusing Air Asia terminal recheck my bags and then go through the whole process to get on to Singapore. As I had bought a ticket from Singapore to Phnom Penh with only 90 minutes between flights - plenty of time for a normal carrier not for Air Asia's bizarre system - I had to change my return flight pay them $55 USD for the pleasure of spending 4 hours in the horrible Air Asia Terminal. They impose a huge burden on customers doing this. The Air Asia web site is excellent - and if they wanted the could easily alert customers that 90 minutes is not enough time to go through their transfer system but of course they do not.

We paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. But on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy.

Hence I was looking at an 8 hour flight with no food or water. It took a lot of complaining for the staff to give me a single 250 ml bottle of water to last me the entire flight! I had to get to talk to the head steward as the others simply walked away from me and refused to offer anything whatsoever.

Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food.

The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced. While boarding the crew insist on blasting cheesy rock music regardless of the time. The vegetarian food is over- priced for the small serving I received.

Efficient boarding at both ends meant early arrival on both sectors. Had the pancake combo for breakfast. Surprised that the drink offered was water and not coffee. I only used them as a friend arrived at DMK also with Air Asia. Price was almost same as Bangkok Airways to BKK and will continue to use them if flying to BKK and beyond.

Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip).

Most recently when AirAsia halted their KL/CMB/KL flights 14 of us were affected from 27 Feb to 5 Mar. Refund was fast even our connecting flights were refunded. Value for money.

2013-01-25,,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi. The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint.

The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value.

Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience.

I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau. It quickly became apparent as most of the pax were in a tour group from mainland china. Standard Air Asia service although this time I booked a hotseat and had a nice chicken lasagne. Flight was 30 mins early. No jetway at MFM but the walk in fact makes getting to immigration easier.

At the airport we had to pay $240 for luggage because I had not checked in online. This holiday was purchased as a package and the flights were to be with Jetstar. The trip took too long overall with waiting time in airports but the worst part was that on the return the flight was supposed to leave Phuket at 7.30pm and was delayed until 9.30pm. Staff kept assuring us the flight to Australia would wait for us. This did not happen and the plane left before we arrived were put up in sub standard hotel for the night. Quite a long day for a 1.5 hour flight from Phuket. Not acceptable.

Pleasantly surprised at the amount of leg room was able to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front with no effort. Didn't order food.

LCCT was its usual mess but I have worked out my standard operating procedure so that I got to the departure hall in good time.

I checked in at the desk without any problem without checked bags. Plane was late inbound but we made up the time on the flight south. Standard AirAsia service with reasonable cabin crew. Not their latest aircraft but interior in good condition. I was lucky to be off the aircraft quickly as the skies opened and there was a short sharp downpour and anyone from the rear of the plane would have been a drowned rat as there is no jetway from AirAsia flights.,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,,4,yes,0.0,0.0,,

I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers. AirAsia is a real mess at LCCT. I have taken more than 50 AA flights including KUL PEN JHB SIN.

You really cannot expect more for the fares on offer and it wasn't as if there was a dearth of choices. Both airline and terminals were perfectly serviceable.

No food or entertainment this was expected so was not a problem. Travelled with our 4 kids ensured they had colouring in books iPods etc. Flight was fine at the end of 9 hrs flying they were ready to get off but behaved well without normal flight gadgets. Also took my own food on board was not stopped and didn't have a problem. Staff not very friendly and don't bother you at all.

On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,4.0,,3,yes,0.0,0.0,,

Paid for the trip by credit card now you have pay for the processing of the transaction. Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline. Air Asia when they first started out were a good low cost airline and value for money but they have declined dramatically the prices have gone up and everything connected with the airline has gone down.

2012-07-09,2,Malaysia,,AirAsia customer review,The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,3.0,,2,no,2.0,1.0,,

2012-07-02,2,Vietnam,,AirAsia customer review,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,2.0,,3,no,0.0,0.0,,

LCCT needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The signboards and facilities are in dire need of improvement. Toilets are wet and slippery.

The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle.

Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available.

Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that.

The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry.

While the bag drop was slow and the food not that good the service was fine as was the aircraft a fairly new looking A320-200. The seat was comfortable enough for a 2hr 20min flight! The flight arrived just about on time and I was through the low cost terminal in 20min; I picked a seat paid for a 25kg bag and had food.

Flight itself was fine although it was a confusing route march to get to the aircraft. Also having a flight to Chennai at roughly the same time seemed to confuse some passenger. Reasonable cabin crew. I ordered meals in advance and they were onboard although I was listed as a 'no-show' on the manifest.

Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight.

FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg.

My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure.

There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG.

2011-12-09,10,United Kingdom,,AirAsia customer review,Flew one-way KUL-LGW and managed to get standby upgrade from economy to Premium via the Optiontown service. Though notification of successful upgrade only came through via email some 8 hours before the flight. Not best but for the low price it was worth it. 14 hrs flight to LGW was fine. Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine.

2011-07-03,8,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,TAA has re-timed their CNX-SIN flight and this is much better although it is a late arrival in CNX on the return sector. My flight to SIN was slightly early but the return was almost 30 mins early into CNX arriving at 2235 instead of 2300. Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer. All in all I'm starting to warm to their Changi service after an indifferent start in January.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,

2011-05-28,9,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,Shopping around I found that there was an excellent promotion fare with TAA from SIN to CNX. I used this service on day one in January and hoped that they could at least get it back to CNX on time. The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,

2011-02-22,5,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,BKK to Hat Yai (HDY) and noticed service deterioration. Flight retimed one month in advance and cause me minor itinerary problem (despite their offer to change to earlier or later flight). Only one Bag drop counter for internet/ Kiosk check in opened. Their advertisement that internet check in is quicker and hassle - free is totally untrue. Once on board A320 aircraft is new and clean but seat pitch is a very tight.

2011-01-26,5,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,Took the inaugural flight from Chiang Mai to Singapore. To say it was just another flight would be an understatement. And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around. Having done PR for major events including such new services I was sorely disappointed. Frankly Thai Ai Asia's product is far below that of its big brother in Malaysia and it shows.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
2011-01-20,6,Netherlands,,AirAsia customer review,"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.",,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no,,,,

2010-10-20,9,Indonesia,,AirAsia customer review,CGK-HKT. The flights were on time aircraft very clean and well-maintained and service was very friendly and professional. I paid a small supplement for one of the 'hotseats' and it was well worth it. The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket. Their regular fares are often only a bit cheaper than other carriers.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,

2010-09-21,9,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,BKK-CAN and HKG-BKK. My first experience of Thailand's division of Air Asia. Good value for money and only a few observations. Having paid for a 'hot seat' the priority boarding in BKK was only to the bus not the plane. There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off. Flights on-time and one of the aircraft was virtually brand new. If the price is right this is the way to go but they are not always the cheapest option especially to Hong Kong where competition is fierce with a multitude of third country carriers flying that route.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,

Flight departed 15minutes early and arrived 25minutes early. seats comfortable legroom ok for a lo-cost carrier. baggage very quick on arrival. Return journey checked in at the desk very quick and efficient. Although flight was only 1/3 full we didn't get seated together and were put across the aisle from each other despite the two seats next to me where empty. Flight on time and arrived early baggage again very quick.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
2010-08-21,8,Thailand,,AirAsia customer review,Bangkok - Yangon - Bangkok. I bought the ticket on internet. The process was a bit time consuming as I had to click through many pages. The 48 hours web check in was very convenient as I could check in on both flights. But still I had to go to the check-in counter at the airport for document check. Check in at Bangkok was long. I only had a handbag and I was directed to a counter for that purpose. Service was good. I am 1.81 and found the seat spacing adequate. There was a wide variety of food options which could be ordered when the ticket was purchased. Cabin staff professional and friendly on both flights. My only complaint is that on the return flight a PRM (Person with Reduced Mobility) was seated between me and the aisle (I had a window seat). I don't think this is legal and it caused discomfort for the other person.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes,,,,
