2024-03-26,9,Australia,Not Verified,"""perfect for what it was"" ",Jetstar gets a lot of bad press but this short trip was perfect for what it was. It was well organised from the checkin to the exit. My seat was fine although I wouldn't like to be sitting in it much more than the hour long trip. The flight left on time and arrived on time. No entertainment or free refreshments but we knew that before boarding.You get what you pay for.

My Flight was cancelled 2 hours prior to departure with the email I received stating that they would cover upto $200 in accommodation and $30 In meals. I was moved to a Qantas flight leaving an hour earlier. I did not make the request to move my flight. I informed them I would not make the earlier flight as I was currently driving to the airport. The Jetstar rep stated I would now have to speak to qantas as I was now on a qantas flight. I called Qantas who changed me to a flight early the next morning. I was required to stay in Sydney and as per the email I received from Jetstar stating my expenses would be covered. The next morning I made the request with Jetstar regarding my expenses. Jetstar stated that as I didn’t make the earlier flight they had changed me onto they would not be covering my expenses. I will never be travelling with Jetstar in the future, this has been a terrible experience.

It pulled away from the gate at precisely 9:25 pm, and got into Melbourne 15 minutes ahead of schedule. We like it when airlines are punctual. I'd reserved a seat for $13, 55G, having suffered 9 hours in a middle seat coming up from Melbourne. Evening snack was a Ham & Cheese toastie, not bad, nice and hot, with a hot chocolate drink, for $12, pretty much what you'd pay in a Melbourne high street cafe, or less. An hour out of Melbourne I was given a chocolate cake and a coffee, the cake was moist, again at $6 pretty good value. The cabin was quiet, the crew was attentive, coming around regularly offering glasses of water. One of those low key professional cabin crews going about their business. Arrived at about 10:10. Melbourne Airport was a shambles, they don't seem able to deal with a number of flights arriving at the same time.

She said you can take it with you as a carry on as it is only 10kgs total. At the gate they said you can’t take it in as you bought a checked baggage not the carry on. She charged us AUD 75 and she kept saying it is non compliant. After charging AUD 75, we still took the same bag with same weight in the carry on baggage.  Their service is pretty bad. We paid $40 before to upgrade our luggage and their team member gave us the wrong advice and we had to pay for that. They don’t take any responsibility of their behaviour towards the customer.  I knew the difference between checked baggage and carry on baggage.

Jetstar Business class allowed you to board first, just like any airline would. You got bigger seats with a lot more room, though the seats were uncomfortable. We were offered a glass of sparkling wine that tasted like petrol with added co2. At 11.30 at night, the choice of meals were potato gnocchi or a cold chicken salad, a small very sweet cake, but a nice roll and butter. We both asked for a beer and were left somewhat bemused by what can only be described as a 150ml glass of beer each. Breakfast was nothing to write home about, nice roll and butter though. All in all, we had a more relaxing flight on the out bound economy flight. The service was better and the food was a lot better, and I managed to have a beer all to myself.

But there is no excuse for playing Taylor Swift songs over the PA at a volume so loud the songs were distorted. Who knows the sensitivities of those passengers not travelling to the concert?

We are a group of 3 and the counter staff told us they could accommodate 1 person on the flight and the other would have to fly the following day. Given everyone had children at home and had businesses to run this was not an options. The second solution was to fly to an airport 3 hours from the destination. This was also not an option.

The staff gave out and told us that they had overbooked flights the previous day and given away our seats to other customers. When we questioned her she shoved her hands in our face and said “I’m not dealing with this” and walked away. No customer service whatsoever and left the junior counter staff to deal with the situation.

We asked why they didn’t give us a courtesy call and she said if it’s under 2 hours they don’t have to and deal with it at the airport.

From the relentless PA announcements about how the crew should be treated, you'd think we were aboard a magical unicorn, not a plane. I get it, some passengers can be a handful, but did we really need to hear the ""be kind to your crew"" mantra four times during the flight? Speaking of the crew, they might want to consider that their primary role is to assist passengers. I asked for a glass of bottled water to take my heart medication. Her response? ""I can't help you, but you can pay $4.00 or drink tap water."" It wasn't about the four bucks; it was about the complete lack of empathy and urgency, especially when I explained that tap water wasn't an option due to my medical condition. Sure, I'd bring my own water onboard if I could, but thanks to Australian regulations, that's a no-go. For medical reasons, the crew should consider making exceptions or providing assistance.  The crew's customer service skills and smiles were about as rare as a blue moon. Upon landing in Sydney, the baggage ordeal was a two-hour-long spectacle. No announcements, no apologies. They even managed to announce the wrong baggage belt twice before passengers had to play detective to locate their belongings. It was absolute chaos – more circus than a well-oiled operation.

My family of 9 went from Sydney to Melbourne (2 ways with same airline). Our flight from Syd to Melb was actually good. We flew with kid (not infant, 2 yo paid ticket) and we brought a foldable cabin size pram with no bag, so it couldn't go into the cabin and must be given to the staff at the gate, free of charge. Which is common on most airlines. The ground staffs in Sydney were friendly. But the flight back from Melbourne to Sydney was a nightmare. The flight delayed for hours, after our original flight was canceled a day before. We were not allowed to check the pram in at the gate. The ground staffs weighed all of our carry-on luggages at the gate, including the pram. So the pram was counted and it caused us to exceed the cabin weight limit. We complained because the pram was not an issue on our previous flight. It's weird and unreasonable because how come the rules in Sydney and Melb are different. But the staff did not accept the complaint and gave us 2 non-negotiable options. 1. Pay the extra charge (double from the normal price) or 2. If we are not willing to pay the charge, they will move us to the next flight for us to checked in the pram but it will cost us more money. We often travel with kids and never have a disappointing experience like this. It was obvious they want to upsell us so bad. We feel scammed. Some staff were rude and arrogant. The way they talked to us from the beginning was disrespectful and intimidating. And one of them kept complaining about our not-so-loud kids.

I had vouchers to use but Jetstar made it so difficult and complicated to redeem them that I had to eventually pay a travel agent to do it for me. The vouchers had been paid to fly to Thailand but when I went to redeem them they didn't even get me to Bali. The flight was 2 hours late in leaving, the staff on the plane were adequate. I was happy we were on a Dreamliner 787 for all the good features it delivers. I paid extra for an exit row so I could stand up and avoid a third DVT. In fact the knowledge that I could fly on a 787 both ways confirmed that I would go to Bali. On the return trip, Jetstar changed the aircraft to a A321LR Neo, a narrow bodied smaller plane with no entertainment and a minimum of space to stand and exercise. All previous seat booking disappeared so I tried to again book exit rows. The Jetstar webpage interface was so unaccommodating that it was difficult to execute this so I missed out on the two that were available. I think it is pertinent that I wouldn't even have known the plane had changed except that my travel agent had sent me an email. I received nothing from Jetstar. When I finally did books some seats and Jetstar emailed me my new itinerary, it indicated that I now had no checked luggage even though I had paid for it. As it turned out other people were sent the same information but none of us new it was going to be ok. I tried to contact Jetstar on their website chat, but after 20 mins waiting I gave up, but I'm sure I'm important to them. The plane was also 2 hours late in leaving Bali because it was 2 hours late in arriving from Australia. The plane was crowded but the seats were unexpectedly comfortable.

2022-09-26,1,Singapore,Trip Verified,"""Give this airline a miss""","Worst airline I travelled with in in my life. Had a holiday in Queenstown, New Zealand and booked a Scoot flight to Sydney from Singapore, and a Jetstar flight to Queenstown from Sydney. At the start of my trip, I faced no issues entering Sydney with my valid Australian Electronic Travel Authority (ETA), and was promptly cleared by immigration. After which, I took my Jetstar flight to Queenstown, and did not encounter any issue as well. At the end of my Queenstown holiday, I arrived promptly at Queenstown airport to check-in for my Jetstar flight back to Sydney (where I would then take a Scoot flight a couple of hours later from Sydney to my final destination - Singapore). At the Jetstar check-in counter at Queenstown airport, I was asked to present my Australian ETA which I did, and was told by the Jetstar staff that there was an issue with my ETA, because my full name was stated in the Family name field, and told me to apply for a new ETA right then and there. Flabbergasted, (as I had not encountered an issue with my ETA that had allowed me entry into Australia twice before, most recent being the start of my holiday AND my ETA only expired in Mar 2023) I did as I was told and started to apply for a new ETA using the Australian ETA app. As retrieval of passport information via the app is by scanning the chip in the passport, my Full Name auto-populated in the Family name field (and could not be edited). Even on the app, it explicitly said ""For some passport types, the applicant’s given name will appear in the family name field… Please do not rescan the applicant’s passport in these cases as the information is displaying correctly"". I highlighted this to the Jetstar staff and was then told to NOT use the app to apply for a new ETA, and to do via the website instead, which went contrary to what was written on the website ""From 6 April 2022, all ETA-eligible passport holders can now apply for an ETA using the Australian ETA app… At this time, ETA lodgement is only available through the Australian ETA app"". Long story short, as I was not able to reconcile this alleged issue at check-in, the Jetstar staff informed that she would not be able to check me in for my flight, and hence I missed my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, which meant that I also missed my Scoot flight from Sydney back to Singapore. Given that I had to return to Singapore ASAP, I had to spend about SGD$2000 for a one-way last-minute flight ticket back to Singapore from Queenstown, and also spent about SGD$300+ for an unintended additional night's stay in Queenstown given that the next available flight was the next day. Lodged a complaint to Jetstar requesting for an explanation, and was informed that it would take up to 15 days for the Resolutions team to get back to me. 15 days came and gone and I again followed up with Jetstar, who informed that it would take another 5 days to process. 5 days have passed and I have yet to receive any word from Jetstar. Without a response, Jetstar is now impeding my ability to take other necessary actions with other entities that will help me with this monetary loss related to travel disruption.

From the get go rude, incompetent customer service at check, so much so that while the staff member from the business class counter was cross examining me about where I plan to fly to next (I was not flying round trip back to Aus) she managed to send my check in suitcase without tagging it. When she realised her mistake not only did she pretend it was being fixed but when I asked the service counter they said the same - three of them standing around having a gab, not a single one checked anything but they were happy to assure me that it was sorted out. Shocker, my suitcase never showed up and since then the baggage services at Sydney airport have confirmed it was never tagged and never even left Sydney airport. Even though it's still there Jetstar have made zero attempt to locate it, a potential match was found a week ago and I had to send someone to the airport to sort things out for me when it became clear the counter staff aren't bothered to do their jobs.

There was no one at the checkin counter so I had to wait about 6 minutes before an airline employee came to attend the counter. When he found out that I was booked on the 3-30 flight he informed me that I would not be able to board the flight even though the flight had not been called and I had no baggage whatsoever. He told me I could take the next flight if paid a new fare of $150,00. He informed that I had lost my money. I returned home and the next day I flew out on Virgin Blue from Brisbane Airport. No money was ever refunded even though it is illegal for airlines to retain the airport taxes. I thought that this firm may have improved, and it was convenient I booked a flight from Gold Coast last Friday 13th of May. I noted that the employees were all very dictatorial, but it seemed OK. The flight departed about 12 minutes late and so it also arrived in Sydney late. The flight time to Sydney was 1hour and 7 minutes. After landing the plane commenced travelling to the terminal, but then stopped. After this it did move a few times. The pilot eventually informed us that there was another plane at our gate refuelling. After 1hour and 37 minutes of sitting on the ground the aircraft arrived at the gate. That is flight time was 1hour and 7 minutes and time spent freezing on the taxiway was 1 hour 37 minutes. On last Monday 16th May we began our return journey being booked on a flight departing Sydney at 6-40pm. Everything went to plan until just before departure, passengers were already entering the aircraft, when 3 airline staff came to weigh our tiny bags. They found that our bags (including our wallets) exceeded their weight limit of 7kg by about 2.1kg. We were 2 passengers so the total weight was 16.1kg.

First thing that went wrong is that our flight from Melbourne to Cairns (JQ940) was cancelled in the middle of the night. So lucky my husband woke up and saw the message, and we spent three hours in the crazy hours of the morning trying to find another flight that would get us to Cairns on the same day. The lack of flight choice without ridiculous stopovers was appalling. And thanks to the airline, we lost an entire day of our trip. But that’s not all. Before we left for our honeymoon, Jetstar told us that our flight home was rescheduled to be earlier. Which was disappointing because we were going to lose another day of our honeymoon. And once again, this morning we received a message in the middle of the night, telling us our flight (JQ941) has been delayed. Well, our hotel front reception weren’t in until 9am to help rearrange a later shuttle bus, so we had to suck it up and head to the airport to wait four hours for our flight. But then, about 10 minutes before our new boarding time, the departures sign showed that our flight would be further delayed by another two hours. So basically, that’s over 6 hours of us dragging around the airport, wasting our time and holiday. I’m currently in Cairns airport as I write this, trying to get back home to Melbourne, really upset. Where’s the communication? No text, no email, the app is all incorrect information. Where’s the staff that we can talk to? And with all the delays put together, it’s literally back to the original flight time we had when we booked. If we had known this earlier than 4am, then we could have spent another day enjoying our honeymoon. All up, I’d say we lost two days worth of our honeymoon, just from Jetstar flight delays and cancellations. I probably will never fly Jetstar again.

I was lucky to have gone to bed late and checked my email by coincidence and there it was cancelled flight. You can imagine my disappointment as I have called them twice previously and waited 2.5hrs on the phone to speak to an operator. I thought being 11.45pm I would be waiting only like half an hour but no I waited 1.5hr. No call back facility available. Then I get a lady who was very, very rude. I told her about my disappointment since the first time I called was due to Jetstar having messed up my transfer in a way that I missed my connecting flight. No apologies for having waited so long at 1am in the morning or for the inconvenience of cancelling the flight. So I asked her to see what other flight i could take so i could make my connecting flight to which she says and 11am flight but its through Qantas and yours was through jetstar so you will have to pay the difference. I questioned her on this as i said but Qantas and Jetstar are the one company and you are the ones who cancelled the flight not me. To which she retorted `You were the one who chose Jetstar'. So then after she calculates the difference and i think this is so wrong from all levels of customer service I instead asked for a flight with Jetstar for the Sunday which is a direct flight to my destination (no transfers as I cant trust them to get it right a 3rd time). So my question to Jetstar is why such long waiting time on the phone? Even after midnight? Is the Call centre in Mumbai as only one time out of the 3 times I called I got a clearly spoken customer service agent that resolved my problem swiftly and courteously. Why do you hire Customer service agents who cannot express them selves clearly, have no aptitude or problem solving skills or desire to help the customer. This is terrible for your business as I will not book with Jetstar again to sit in a phone line 2.5hrs average is just unacceptable. Last minute changes and no apologies and rude customer service agents who can't articulate themselves properly, have attitude and down right rude. My biggest gripe is why cant I change these flights online myself? It says you can but when you go to do it it says you must call a customer agent so its a futile process deliberately done to frustrate the customer and beg for something or a service that you have already paid for but will not get.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne,Prosperine,,January 2021,,,,1,no,,,

Instead of giving me a refund, Jetstar just offered me a voucher (still haven't received anything yet). Because it's really important for me to go I decided to pay $300 to go with Air New Zealand.

On 1/31/2020, we got a call from Portland, Oregon International Airport (PDX) Alaska Airline counter on 1/31/2020. They told us that our bags arrived at PDX and asked us to contact Jetstar and make arrangement to pick up (because Jetstar doesn't have any contract with Alaska Airline to deliver missing bags to customers). We discussed options with Jetstar luggage reps several times and spent over three hours on the phone. Finally, they gave us three options: 1. We can go to PDX and pick up the baggage ourselves. 2. Ask Alaska Airline to make arrangement to deliver the baggage. Alaska told us they could not do so since they don't have contract with Jetstar. 3. Arrange a third-party courier to pick up.

SYD - MEL flight was good, and I can't see myself ever paying extra to fly QF or VA for an hour hop. Everything had to be paid for, but honestly, I didn't mind - you close your eyes and you're there. Seats themselves were not very well padded, but that's to be expected. Legroom was ideal, coming from a semi-tall bloke. Bags came out quickly, had an on-time departure and arrival, service was great. That's to be expected, and from someone who had never flown them before, I felt that what everyone always says about them is misguided - it's a budget airline after all. We took the Skybus from St Kilda to Tullamarine - the last of the day @ 8 pm, so we had to wait around the airport for a bit. However, for a $20.50 fare for two adults (special), the convenience and not having to catch public transport was worth it. Check-in at Tullamarine was easy, as was bag drop, went through security, only to find our flight had been cancelled due to the crew timing out (read - legally worked too long that shift to be able to operate the onward flight) - so, back through the terminal and waiting in a line for help. Thank god we got there when we did, because the queue stretched for ages right after we arrived. The good thing is, it's super easy to change your flight when it's cancelled. We originally changed our flight to a 6:05 am departure with Jetstar, but seeing the provided accommodation was in Preston - a good 45mins away by taxi, we tried to get a better flight - also seeing that people had been able to change to Qantas flights. They are constantly loading more flights and options into the system in the event of a cancellation, so we asked to see if there was anything better they could do for us, and it turns out that there was a Virgin flight the next day leaving at 9AM. This suited us, and we were set. The accommodation they provided was great - fairly modern and gave us meal vouchers to use at the hotel - we used them for breakfast, which was okay, but I would use them for dinner depending on when you need to go there if you're in the same situation. They also reimburse you for any taxi services you need to get to and from the airport - however you need to coordinate this yourself after the journey is done. However, the lady coordinating the giving out of hotels at Tullamarine was rude. Too sassy for her own good, we tried making conversation with her and all she could do was give snarky comments back - when she was literally doing her scheduled job (write people's names down on a list), at her normal shift time. We're the ones being delayed here - you're getting paid. Cut the attitude. However, everyone else at the service desk was friendly, which was good. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Jetstar again given my experience on the first flight, but it's also good knowing they have a good system for cancellations - you're covered even if they're unable to fly. And, for paying $150pp incl bag, getting a free hotel, taxi service, and a widebody Virgin flight the next day with inc food and entertainment was great value for money.

Our experience with Jetstar Airways on a flight in New Zealand was very disappointing due to the disruption in the flight, the subsequent lack of communication, and the promises of staff that were not supported by corporate. Jetstar experienced a countrywide failure in their computer systems causing manual processing leading to delayed flights. Our flight was delayed over 4 hours causing our connection to the US to be missed. There was no later flight, so an overnight stay was required. There was no communication about status - the flight boards were not updated. In fact the board showed that we had arrived, when in fact we hadn't even left. I was not able to pursue changes with the connecting flight airlines because they showed the flight on time.  Upon arrival in Auckland I was informed we would be transported to a hotel and provide meals. Later I was told the transportation would not be provided but we could take the Skybus and submit expenses for reimbursement. I asked if there was more than one hotel for the brand and was told no. When I got to the Skybus counter, I was asked which of the two hotels for that brand. I went back to the ticket counter to get the specific location, and by the time I returned we had missed the bus. Upon arrival in Auckland there was a long (1km) walk to the hotel. Upon checking out the next day we were advised that the hotel was paid, and a $30 credit for meals was applied. The latter in direct conflict with written policy that it should've been $60 and further that the airport representative stated that would not be limited to $60. Upon return to the airport the next day, there was no one available to handle the reimbursement request so we submitted the request for expense reimbursement online ($167). After waiting over a week past the processing timeline I followed up via chat. At which time I was advised that they would not support reimbursement of any kind despite the statement of staff. No avenue for escalation was provided. I accessed their chat complaint system, uploading all of the original documents supporting the reimbursement request. I was on the chat for 2 and ¼ hrs. and asked redundant questions and then to be advised there is no reimbursement. At one point the individual stated there is no reimbursement when in home city, which was blatantly wrong as it was clear my home city is in the US.

The lines were unbelievably long due to most people having no idea how to check in at the kiosk and were dumbfounded with the bag tag. It was mass chaos and no one from JetStar assisting in any way. I had done my research and paid for my extra baggage and carry-ons before arrival. By the time you pay for the extras, believe me, I spent much more than if I just flew Qantas or Virgin. But Jetstar had the flight schedule I needed. Arrived at the gate, weighed my carry-on and the customer service rep tagged my bag. We sat there and sat there. No plane, no announcements. Then about 200 other passengers descended upon our gate. Something was up. No gate agents at the desk. Finally an announcement of a gate change. I move to the new gate. There is a plane. We sit for another 30 minutes, I'm suspect there is a problem as we are scheduled to fly an A321 and an A320 is at the gate, which will not accommodate all the passengers. Suddenly, I watch all of the gate agents pack up and leave. No announcement, nothing. They just walk away and disappear. Again, I get up and walk over to the departures board and see that again we have a new gate. I go back and announce it to those of us sitting at a gate. We all move to the new gate per the board. An announcement was never made of the gate change and passengers were running all over the place, confused, furious - mass chaos. Finally we board. I'm sitting in the first row 1A, extra room seat and I paid the premium for it. I notice that I'm sitting in a wet seat and the carpeting is soaked and squishy. The cabin manager, who is professional, gregarious and superlative in customer service briefs us on operating the emergency exit and then we sit and wait. We sit and we sit. The PA of the plane is not working. The cabin crew notices the water and the wet carpet. Mechanics determine that due to the heavy rains, someone left the door open and the water affected the electrics of the PA system. We sit as they try to fix it. Of course the plane is taken out of service, and our cabin crew is now illegal and we disembark. We gather again in the gate, and remarkably a new plane was promised and delivered. At this point, the gate agents were finally competent and doing their jobs. I have to say I found the cabin crews to be excellent and I felt very safe flying Jet Star. The hassle one experiences at the gate is absurd to say the least. Flying is bad enough on a full service carrier, so why torture yourself with JetStar.

With Jetstar, you have to pay for checked baggage and for seat selection and meals which adds to the cost and it somehow ends up being more expensive than Virgin or Qantas. The flight I was on JQ 920, was scheduled to leave Cairns at 0850 and arrive in Darwin at 1125. A Jetstar employee notified customers that the flight was delayed by half an hour. 20 minutes later, the same message was repeated meaning the flight had been delayed by an hour. Then I got a notification on my phone saying that the flight wasn’t going to leave until 1650!! This was bad news for me as I had a connecting flight out of Darwin. I then spoke to both Jetstar and Qantas customer services and they couldn’t put me onto another flight combination (even though there were at least 20 seats on two Qantas planes back home, I googled it). The customer service, in my opinion handled it very poorly and only offered me accommodation in Darwin. I needed to get home urgently for an appointment the next day but they couldn’t care less, no sympathy shown at all.

We had a domestic flight from Sapporo to Tokyo and followed by an international flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong with Jetstar. The staff at Sapporo check in counter did not speak a word of English, so when she struggled to tell us that we had to get our luggage and re-check in through their international flight counter in Tokyo, we thought we heard her wrong. Also, they charged us 10,000 yen for 2 luggage bags and measured the dimension of the only carry-on we had.  The domestic flight was late by 30 minutes. Our layover time in Tokyo was supposed to be 1hr 50min. So by the time we got to Tokyo and got our bags, it was already less than an hour before the flight takeoff to Hong Kong. We had to run all the way to their counter and check in our bags again and ran to the gate, just to later on find out the flight to Hong Kong was also delayed. The boarding is always a disaster for them. They have all the passengers lineup for boarding at once and could take almost an hour to finish boarding, no wonder their flight is always late. Staffs were unresponsive and rude.  Due to their delayed flights, we could not have a chance to eat before we got on board, so we wanted to order food off the menu. I tried to call the attendants 3 times that we wanted to order, they kept telling me to wait. My husband said they may only take order with their food trolley which they moved from front to the end cabin. OK!

I decided to sleep at a hotel nearby which costed me $180 on which I thought I would get reimbursed with $30 for food reimbursements as well but I ended up with nothing as I had to live in a area 50 km away from the airport.

The outbound flight received a few complaints about running out of cheesecake for dessert but that was not the crew's fault. I flew business class which is not the same as business class on other airlines but comparable. The under leg supports only came up to mid calf which was very uncomfortable. The inbound flight check in crew and arrangements for check in at Phuket airport, did puzzle me. All business class and economy class passengers were in the same queue which is not normal. As Jetstar is a subsidiary of Qantas I expected fairly fluent English to be spoken at the airport. They were polite but understanding of English was far from good. All people checking in were from Europe or Russian and they all communicated in English. They looked at my passport and asked me if it was ""New"" when it clearly showed in it that it had been issued in 2013. It did not show up on their system which was strange as it did when I had arrived two weeks earlier. One very helpful staff member called the Australian Embassy for clearance.

I read all the horrible reviews and thought, aw c’mon, how bad can they really be? Well, here it is. Booked a non-stop flight from Honolulu to Melbourne scheduled to depart 8AM and arrive about 10-1/2 hours later on October 1st. Arrived at the airport and stood in the check-in line only to find out that the flight was cancelled. No advance notice whatsoever! We were sent away to a hotel shuttle after being assured that we should be rescheduled for the next day and would be notified later in the day in any event. After hearing nothing from Jetstar by early afternoon, we logged into their website to discover that we had been rebooked for 8:30AM on October 5th, connecting through Sydney with a 7-hour layover! So, instead of a direct 10:30 journey, we were now spending 3 nights waiting for a 19-hour journey and all without even the courtesy of a notification. To make matters worse, when my wife and I finally got on the plane, we discovered that we were not even seated together on this wonderful replacement flight and we had paid extra for our seats on the original flight. Plus, it gets even better. Jetstar does not transfer luggage between an international and domestic flight on the same ticket so we needed to collect our bags in Sydney and drag them around the airport with us for 5-hours because Jetstar will not accept bags until 2-hours before a flight. This also meant that we could not get through security to reach a decent restaurant for those 5-hours as well and needed to just hang out in the outer airport by the ticket counters. But this still was not the end of our ordeal. As a cherry on top, we were rewarded by the likes of a very nasty counter clerk who insisted that the very same bags that we had dragged over from international were now 2kg overweight each and demanded another $60! What happened? Did our bags pick up 4kg of grime off the airport floors as we dragged them around behind us for the past 5-hours? We elected to throw out a couple of books and my hiking boots rather than pay these jokers another dime! Oh, and the domestic flight to Melbourne ended up delayed by 20 minutes.

In the air the service was fine, but check-in was beyond dreadful. My wife and I had flown Air Asia from Phuket to Singapore on 14th, and I must say their check in was trouble free. On return from Singapore on 19th, however, your check-in clerk first demanded to see my Thai Residence Card. Of course there is no such thing as I explained to the clerk’s evident displeasure, and implied disbelief. Then she wanted to know which bag was mine. My wife and I had one suitcase for our clothes, one bag for our shoes and paraphernalia, and one hand bag each. Check-in bags weighed just over 32 kg. I had purchased 20kg of luggage, and my wife had purchased 15kg so I had no concerns over weight. However your clerk insisted that luggage cannot be combined, and that one bag must be mine, and the other could be my wife’s, so I agreed that the suitcase could be mine, whereupon she demanded payment for 7kg overweight on “my” case, despite the total being well within our purchased 35kg. Naturally I was not attracted to her proposal. So then I had to remove some contents of the suitcase and put them in the shoe bag, remove bulky but light items from the shoe bag and put them in a new carry-on bag purchased from Smiths, and make my carry-on briefcase into a check-in bag. This took a lot of time, so your clerk wanted me to do that away from check-in because I was now causing a backlog in the queue. Of course this was impossible, because I needed access to the scales to balance each bag to a spurious amount. The frustration mounted in all quarters. Your clerk told me “it’s not my fault it’s Company policy”. I told her she represented the Company, and that this was unacceptable. Certainly I would not permit one of my staff to say that. We finally got our boarding passes, no money had changed hands, everyone was frustrated, no-one benefited, I was thoroughly stressed, and we had lost all the time we had planned to spend in the airport. Then I saw that your clerk had not given my wife and I adjoining seats. “All other seats are taken, and this is the closest I can give you” she told me. This was a lie. When I took my seat, both seats next to me were empty and so were the entire two rows in front of me. This was resolved painlessly on the aircraft by helpful and charming flight crew, but I was so unhappy by then that I have vowed never again to take Jet Star if I had an alternative. And of course I regale all my friends with the story. Their response? “Typical Jet Star.” I do not expect frills with a low-cost airline, but I expect common sense, and some understanding that the passenger is not just a process item.

Due to foreseen circumstances, the original flight was cancelled and we were forced on to economy on the replacement flight when there were more than 2 seats available in the business cabin. (The response from their customers' service regarding this complaint was there were no seats in business which is not true) We were ensured by Jetstar staff we were guaranteed with business class seats on the replacement flight (online customer service representative and ground staff who I’ve confirmed with on the night of the cancellation ). I have saved all the chat history with the customer service representative. The Jetstar customer service representative has given us misleading information.

I have flown with Jetstar from the very beginning when I first started flying and have never had a problem until now. My first international trip was a disaster to say the least. First of all we checked in and dealt with a rude staff member who separated my sister and I on the plane because he did not speak clearly whilst asking if I would able to help with the emergency exit if it were to come to that. Because he didn’t speak clearly I then said “sorry?” And then told me “it’s not a joke and they take it very seriously so you can’t sit together”. Fair enough although I did not hear this man so I found it very irritating to seperate us based on the fact he didn’t speak clear enough. After our flight we landed in Denpasar (Bali), we went to collect our luggage, stood there for an hour and my bag was no where to be found. After talking to the luggage people at the Denpasar airport, they have gave us a piece of paper and we had not heard anything else. We then put in a claim with Jetstar and waited to hear back from them, we found out our luggage had never actually left Brisbane, where we departed from. This was extremely frustrating as we were in a foreign country with no more then a couple pieces of clothes. Meanwhile waiting to hear back from Jetstar we had to spend a lot of money just to accomodate ourselves with clothes and everyday necessities. We had money, expensive clothes and undergarments in this bag. We finally heard from Jetstar 2 days into our trip saying our baggage was in Bali and they would deliver it to us at our villa. We sent our address and never heard back, here we are leaving and still don’t have our luggage. We went a week without anything, we constantly emailed Jetstar to see what they would do to compensate for this massive problem and they showed no compassion or care for what has happened and have only told us to wait. Luckily a nice man at the Denpasar airport has located our luggage and has set it up on our flight back home and that is the service we wanted. Jetstar has still not done anything at all to help, fix or apologise for this entire issue.

Flight was initially direct then we were notified it would change to a stopover in Sydney. That was the start of our frustration as flying with small children is challenging at the best of times. Then on check in we discovered our baggage wasn’t included. Although only a couple of kilos over for carry on we would be charged $120 and have to reprint our tickets 3 times from 2 different desks and check in our carry on bags and have to pick up and transfer our own luggage between flights. Due to the tiny seating spaces and my above average height once again I sit separate to my family in some vacant seats offered by one of the flight attendants probably the best and worst service at the same time received. On arrival to Sydney I’m advised I can go out and recheck the bags while the family stays inside. So I do so and on attempting this am told I cannot re enter the airport and check my family’s bags and they would have to come out and that we couldn’t re check them in for another 2 hrs. When we are finally rechecking in we accidentally remove our carry on bag checked stickers and are then told our bags are not packed correctly and they will have to be repacked now waiting to see how the second part of the trip will pan out with a very tired and frustrated family and our second flight is delayed.

Flights are delayed all the time. Of the 13 flights I've taken, 3 have been delayed and 1 has been cancelled. Not a great track record. - They now weigh all baggage to the nearest gram. $60 fee if you're even slightly over. Explain to me how this isn't a money grab. Myself, a 65kg male with a bag weighing 7.1kg, gets charged $60 for an overweight bag when a larger man, probably 120kg+ has an underweight bag and is considered fine. If this actually about weight cumulative weight, my extra 100g would not make a difference. As said, one of my flights was cancelled. Fine, no worries, it happens. The problem is their customer service and focus, or lack thereof on customer satisfaction. Jetstar informed me that I would receive my refund in 7 working days. Warning: This is a lie. I attempted to fly on the 6th January 2019, this flight was cancelled. It is now the 26th April 2019 and still no refund to be seen. I called them today to which I was put on hold for half an hour and told was there was a 'technical glitch'. This 'glitch' seems a little coincidental when I'm asking for money back, especially from a company that loves to money grab at the slightest opportunity and lies about returning refunds. I digress. In my case, they cancelled the last flight out on a Sunday evening to which I had to spend an extra $100 to get to work the next day - not impressed. Might I add 0 compensation for this. You can tell Jetstar is an awful company to work for and their customer support policies highlight that. The girl dealing with my refund call said 'I'm sorry sir, I can understand why you are frustrated but I'm just following company policy'. I told her that my frustrations are not toward her but toward Jetstar as a company and how they operate. I've been on the other side of that coin in hospitality, I know how a disgruntled customer feels. I expressed to her that my frustrations were not with her, told her to enjoy her day and thanked her for her help. She thanked me at the end of the call for my understanding and to quote, I was the 'first person to ever say that'. Back to the point.

Often our major complaint is the the poor customer service, the lack of service and the grossly rude staff. This trip however was Jetstar's worst example of service to date. With my elderly mother in-law traveling with us we requested assistance as she suffers from MS. In Melbourne we were convinced to use a buggy instead of a wheelchair. As many of you know there is a lengthy corridor to the gates so assistance was required, she cannot walk more than a couple of hundred metres without stopping for an extended period. By the time we reached the service area after security there was a sign stating they were closed. No buggy, no wheelchair and an elderly passenger pushing herself to the gate down that long corridor. Once in Tasmania, her legs and knees swelled so badly we could not walk anywhere at all. Our days were spent sightseeing from a car, evenings at home, no outings, no dinner and no shopping because what little energy and strength she had was used to walk to and from the house and car. We cancelled dinner reservations, wine tasting and MONA. As a family we know how to manage her condition, all of this inflammation in her legs was a direct result of her Friday walk and when we tried to explain this Jetstar staff were dismissive and naturally did not want to accept responsibility. On our return we were overweight with our carry-on only baggage. We are only to assume we were overweight on our way to Tasmania given that at absolutely no point did anyone check our bags in Melbourne or weigh them so we assumed we were fine. Owning this mistake we unhappily paid the exorbitant $60 fee to check an 11-12kg bag. At this time we discussed that nobody checked our bags at check in at the counter, nobody asked if Anjutta required assistance, nobody did their job yet again but had the nerve to cripple us on check in at the gate. We have no problem folllowing rules, process and guidelines as this is very familiar territory for us however all we ask for Jetstar is that you ensure your business upholds the quality, consistency and values it preaches. It is simply another example of your poor service and more importantly your lack of consistency from airport to airport. This is a training issue and an onboarding issue, you cannot run a successful business unless your employees are being taught and upheld to the highest standards.

Yesterday I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Bali around 5:45 pm. Firstly, I got a message from Jetstar about delay for 2,5 hours due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Then after arriving to the airport for 2,5 hours later as was said we had to wait for another hour to be seated. When all passengers were finally seated the pilot announced that there is a small problem regarding air conditioner and we needed to wait for technicians to fix it. 1 h later the pilot apologised again and announced that the problem was almost fixed and we were expecting to depart soonish. After 1 hour more which was in total 2 hours of waiting on a plane we were informed that we weren’t able to depart that day and were asked to leave the aircraft. Then the lady on a check in desk advised calling helpline to figure out what my next steps are. So I immediately contacted Jetstar and after chatting with a staff member of the helpline the nearest available flight which they could provide was in 4 days after my actual one which means that I am going to lose 5 days of my holidays! I understand that technical issues can happen but to not accommodate and suggest a flight that would arrive 5 days later is ludicrous! You have effectively ruined more then half of my holiday. I had to buy another ticket through another airline and also requested a refund for my canceled flight because there was no point of flying 4 days later. However, customer service said that they would not reimburse for my accommodation and transport (for the extra incurred directly arising from jetstars failure). I will never ever fly through Jetstar airline again. Yes they have lower price in comparison to Qantas for example but it’s not worth it.

2019-02-03,4,Australia,Trip Verified,"""not a great experience""","Singapore to Perth via Bali. JQ117 leaves Singapore at 5.20am and arrives Perth 12.30pm, with a 50min stop in Bali on the way. On this trip this A320 aircraft was 1 of 3 versions and had more legroom because the seat pocket was above the tray table. Other Jetstar flights I've flown domestically and internationally, my knees hit the seat in front due to the layout and lower seat pockets, so i was very pleased with legroom, however the seats are lacking some serious padding and if the seat behind you puts something in the seat pocket and closes their tray table, the object pokes you in the back. We were lucky to get row 4 and I was actually seated next to a Jetstar employee who was hitching a ride back to Perth after working the same trip in reverse the previous day. The 1st leg I unsuccessfully tried to sleep for the 1st 30mins as we had been in transit at Changi airport for about 9hrs. I then struck up conversation with the Jetstar employee the next 1.5hrs went quickly with conversation and soon we descended for landing. On arrival at Bali all passengers had to disembark with all luggage etc, even though the same aircraft was our aircraft continuing to Perth and our seats were exactly the same.. this is probably the most poorly organised part of the trip. We disembarked at gate 9b, the last and furthest gate of the terminal. The transit lounge, as we followed signage on and on is at the other end of the terminal, where our tickets and passports were checked again, then security check again, where we lost our water bottles again (you learn to travel with empty bottles because every time you go through security you lose it). The metal detector was so sensitive, the only metal my wife was wearing was her wedding bands and it still set off the sensor and she gad to be scanned manually. Meanwhile all this walking and lines for checks takes up quite a bit of time, so by the time we were through ( and remembering we were in the front of the the aircraft so we disembarked fairly quickly), they started final boarding call for our flight. We checked the monitors - go to gate 9b, looking down the long terminal we couldn't even see N o9 so we started our brisk walk, 3 kids in tow. At about 1/2 way 1 child needed a toilet stop so three kept going and I waited, hearing again the final boarding call. We basically jogged the next 4 gates thinking we would muss it. On arrival at the gate my flustered wife and 2 kids were waiting, unable to board because I had all the tickets and passports. Anyway, another line up for another security check, this time full open all bag checks? Thos that somehow found time to buy water, lost them again, I was down to my last empty bottle. Finally boarded to find my Jetstar friend still beside me and hadn't had to disembark, they couldn't believe we had all just had to go the full length of the airport twice and 2 more security checks to get back on the same aircraft,  by this time my wife and I were pretty annoyed. We had to wait a while for all passengers to board, the last passengers being 3 quite elderly people who were also very flustered and short of breath, i felt sorry that they to had to walk that marathon. I was told i could refill my water on the aircraft, I asked several times but never got it. I asked for one with my pre-purchased meal but was told I could only get coffee or tea, was never offered to purchase one? Poor customer service.

After reaching the gate and having my carry on luggage weighed and being over by 3kg, I was told I would need to go and check it in for $60. Back out of the departure lounge I go, passing the security I just waited 20 minutes to go through and to the service desk where I would recite that my carry on baggage is over the designated amount and that I have been told to have it put under the plane. The staff member on the service desk re-weighs my bag and tells me that it doesn't need to go under the plane, I just need to pay $30 for an extra baggage allowance, which I do, and then he puts a tag on my mini suitcase and handbag and we proceed back towards the even larger cue at the security check. At this point I'm a little bit annoyed that I had to walk out and re do this process just to be told that my bag doesn't need to go under the plane, however, I was the one who went over the weight limit so I don't mind. After getting back to the terminal where my plane is boarding I am singled out by the staff member who originally told me I needed to go pay extra to have my bag put under the plane. I tell him that I have just been out to the service desk and already had my baggage sorted. He said no, grabbed my bag from me and put it on the scales. Said that it needed to go under the plane and started telling me callously that he told me this already and that it's my fault- I would have to pay an additional $60 and have it checked in. It had been a long morning and after being sent here and there I was emotional (my anxiety caving in around me) and against my best efforts, started crying. This elicited no sympathy, only a defensive manner of tone from the staff member. I tried telling him again that I had followed his instructions which led me to the service desk who then told me otherwise. Thank God my boyfriend was there to help communicate because I was a mess. The lady who processed the payment was helpful and caring,  in the end instead of charging me $60 on top of the recently paid $30 she only made me pay the difference. It was the lack of communication and knowledge of policy by staff members as a whole, and the rudeness and belittling nature encountered by one staff member in particular that has made me decide I will not be flying with this airline again nor will I be recommending it.

Ridiculous baggage restrictions with unreasonable extra costs, poor customer service, no complimentary drinks or snacks, no included meals for a 9 hr flight, and no in-flight entertainment. Jetstar ruined Christmas and was a terrible start to our holidays. My husband and I have been living abroad for a year now and we were really hoping to make it home for Christmas to see our families. Jetstar had a great price for flights, so we told our families we would be able to afford Christmas at home with them so long as they knew that we wouldn't be able to afford additional Christmas gifts. We each had 1 hiking backpack (to their low expectation of 30lbs per check-bag - which is 50lbs with every other airline), each had 2 small backpacks as a carry-on, and packed 2 suitcases of things we decided to fly home with us as we had accumulated quite a few things while living there on a Working Holiday Visa. We packed up a full suitcase filled with Australian treats - enough to fill a stocking for each of our siblings as well as our parents to thank each of them for hosting us while we were home for the holidays. I had prepaid for check-baggage prior to the flight - only to realize that the bags were limited to 30lbs, and that I wasn't able to purchase additional baggage (I assumed I'd be able to purchase these 2 additional bags once we arrived at the airport). I assumed wrong. We arrived at the airport with our pre-weighed carry-on backpacks and our 30lb check bags. I planned to pay the same steep rate of $115 per additional check-bag (of only 30lbs and not the regular 50lbs) once we got there, though while checking in, we were told that was not an option and that we would need to pay $25 per kg. We were quoted a total of $1300 for our additional bags. We paid $1400 ($700 each) for our flights, $230 for our pre-paid luggage, and then would have paid $1300 dollars extra to get 2 suitcases home - both at 50lbs. More than our flights! We stepped aside and sorted through our luggage to decide what we were able to bring home. We narrowed our bags down to 1 suitcase and packed it to 20 kilos. We were charged an additional $500 for 1 suitcase  to fly back home. A whole suitcase of Christmas gifts had to be thrown out as we could not afford to take it home to our families. We found a security guard, asked him if he had kids, and said Merry Christmas. I wish it had ended there. The lady checking us in couldn't put our payment through as her computer wasn't working. When she finally got us checked in, her payment terminal wasn't functioning. Once the payment was put through, we had to move over to someone else that then printed our boarding passes for us. She also told us that they weren't going to be able to get us a seat together -  the best part is that the plane was half empty - and the lady sitting a couple of rows up from us got to lay on the 4 seats in the middle on her own because her ankle was sore and she wanted to put her feet up. They didn't have complimentary drinks, no complimentary snacks, or meals for a 9 hr flight. On top of that, your only option for entertainment was to pay a $10 fee for in-flight entertainment as they didn't have any movies to show on the plane - and they couldn't even make the effort to get us a seat beside each other with half of the plane empty.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney,Honolulu,,December 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,

But this prove me wrong as they asked to weigh my bag at the self check in kiosks including my laptop bag and total allowance is only 7kg, how can this be possible? Even Scoot which is also one of the budget airline allowed 10kg cabin excluding laptop bag, I wonder how can they include the laptop bag to a total of 7kg allowance, I don't think anyone would be able to get thru this if you travel with a small cabin bag plus laptop, as laptop itself is normally 3kg and plus an empty cabin bag is 2kg, so unless you bring nothing in the cabin bag, else for sure you will need to buy a checkin bag on last minute which will cost you SGD60 which is half of the price of the airfare and not to add in the return baggage as well which will almost close to the price I pay to Garuda which is not a budget airline! So why should I still travel with Jetstar Airways in the future -totally pointless! First time encountered this with a budget airline and I will never travel with them again and won't bother to care about their promo caused this should not be the way for them to conduct business to suck their customer money like this and I feel is not ethical to use this way to lure your customer by promo but suck their money by forcing as in fact all of us caught by surprise and have no choice to pay.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore,Bali,,November 2018,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,,,

We are Asians in appearance but both my husband and I are physicians from the USA.  As she was printing our boarding passes and luggage tags, she said she could see that we paid for two checked-in bags but she could not locate which passengers they were paid under, therefore she still had to charge us for the two checked in bags. I said I had the receipt for the paid checked-in bags. She looked through the computer again and said she still had to charged me for the two checked in bags. I could not believe it! It does not make any sense. I said I was not going to pay again because she could not find it. It is a form of incompetence. She then said ""I am not going to serve you anymore. You have to go to someone else."" and left me there standing. She did not tell me where to go initially. She was clearly doing that to delay my check-in process as a punishment and aggravates my anxiety as the flight departure time was approaching. I then requested to speak to her supervisor. Her supervisor was better but obviously not well trained for customer service (did not display ability to de-escalate the situation). But she figured out the problem was the car seat.

Two cards failed to work and one notifies me if the payment is declined so I know there was no problem on my side. Luckily, I left the option on as unpaid so wasn't charged extra at the airport. They didn't tell me this was an option while I was on the live chat with them though. An on the subject of the live chat, anything typed into the box, even if you don't press send, is sent to the agent. They only record messages which are ""sent"" which can mean accidental pastes are sent (perhaps a password for example?) and they have no record that their employee received it. Also, if you want a copy of everything said in the chat, you have to speak to a different team. This is basic functionality available in most live chat services. I contacted them with a complaint. The first response was just excuses and the offer of a voucher which can only be used by me and expires in 6 months. I live in the UK so completely useless. I contacted them again and they said they had forward some of my comments on to the development team around the live chat but nothing was said about the meal or voucher.

They told us they are organising us hotels & shuttle buses. There were hundreds of us waiting outside for the shuttle. I decided to uber it to the airport which was just down the road (could have walked there) only to arrive and be told we have to wait til 3pm for checkin. Finally when we got our rooms could only have a few hrs rest before getting a shuttle to another hotel where we got a voucher or dinner. But on arrival there was a long queue of people waiting in line! As if we are not exhausted & over waiting. I left and decided to make my own way to the airport.

The aircraft was in OK condition, my seat was bearable for a one hour flight, Jetstar got me to my destination on time and my bag arrived on the baggage carousel. But it's very difficult to travel on this airline without thinking that they take every opportunity to shakedown their customers. In the departure lounge, I witnessed people being asked for more money for their carry-on. Thanks to other posters on this site, I knew in advance to check in my bag (which other airlines accept as carry-one without question), so it didn't affect me personally. I had bought a starter-plus bundle, which at the time of purchase was claimed to offer standard seat allocation, a baggage allowance, frequent flyer points, and a snack. When I received the itinerary, there was no mention of the snack. Equally, when I received the boarding pass, there was no mention of the snack, either, but there was a four digit code, so I asked a crew member at checkin what the four digit code was and she replied that it was because I had paid to have my seat allocated in advance (seat allocation is part of the starter-plus bundle). When the cabin crew were promoting the sale of snacks and drinks, they said that they would accept Mastercard, Visa, or American Express, but they said nothing about people who had bought the starter-plus bundle. When the crew member serving snacks got to my seat, I showed her the boarding pass and asked her if it entitled me to a snack. Yes, she said, your choice up to $10. Why don't they print this on the boarding pass and announce it when about to serve snacks? I nearly went without – I thought I must have got the wrong idea about what was included in the starter-plus bundle. I can't help but get the feeling the airline wanted me (and other starter-plus customers) to forget the fact that the bundle includes a snack. No doubt it's more profitable if people pay for a second time, or go without, as I nearly did.

This charge along with their $15 PER Kg charge will add about $70 to your flight each way. They will not take into account that you flew out with their partner airline on the same booking with which can lead to some obvious confusion when you cant come back with the luggage you flew out with. To top it of once they know you're at your weight limit the smell blood and really go in for the kill to make an extra buck.

We had quite a bit of luggage as we were moving from Canada to Australia and had everything that we came over with, so we had to purchase extra luggage. Although we had to pay the extra surcharge for 30 kg's of checked luggage each the price was very reasonable (Considering a similar flight in Canada would probably be double the cost). Prior to boarding I saw another Jetstar flight weighing carryon baggage to make sure that everyones carryon baggage met the standard of 7kg. I was a little worried because although we only had a backpack each, 7kgs is not a lot of weight. However, when it was time for our flight to board we did not have to weigh our carry on bags. I am not sure why we got the pass on the scale and the other flight had to weigh their bags. The flight itself took off on time and had the seatbelt sign off within a few minutes. We were in Seats 20 E & F, however as there was a kid kicking the back of my seat I moved as there was free seats in row 20 ABC. The leg room was probably the worst pitch I have ever sat in, coming in at 29 inches. I am 188cm (6' 2"") tall, so this was uncomfortable for me however anyone smaller would be okay for the short flight. The staff came around just after take off to do a service. Standard stuff was available for purchase (hot/cold drinks, sandwiches, snacks), but there was no complementary drinks or snacks. There was a family sitting in the 2 rows behind us that had 5 small kids that were making a lot of noise and not following the seatbelt sign. At one point the staff acted very professionally and asked the parents to get the kids back in their seats for landing. We landed on time and exited the plane on the tarmac, but were walking distance to the terminal so we didn't need a bus. Overall an average flight for the price we paid, I probably would not recommend as the legroom was uncomfortable and there were a lot of families and children that made the flight seem chaotic at times.

I was told that I could swap my flight for an afternoon flight on Thursday, or morning flight on the Friday. Or a voucher for the amount of the cancelled flight. I explained that my reason for travel was a job interview in the morning (not just leisure or an unimportant trip) and therefore an afternoon flight was pointless. I could not be flexible - not to mention my return flight to Sydney was scheduled for 3pm. Arrive in Melbourne at 1pm and return to Sydney at 3pm the same day?? I told them I had no need for a change of time and date unless that change landed me in Melbourne in time for my interview. I was given more options (and then fewer options) for Thursday afternoon or Friday, and not one that actually properly compensated me for this cancellation. A voucher provided in five business days was not a solution, and with no extra planes added the following day to compensate for the hundreds of passengers put out; I was left with no solutions, and out of pocket. Finally I agreed to their only form of refund (despite the assistant explicitly saying at one point Jetstar can refund cash depending on the reason...ie whether they deem it worthy). It was this point that I was offered the amount for the cancelled flight, only. They still tried to charge me the cost of the return flight despite cancelling my initial flight! The attempt to still charge me for the return flight, after an hour of nil solutions, was enough to firm my mind. Avoid Jetstar. They do not care about their customers. They are a budget airline because they take advantage of their customers to make a profit. I could only just afford the flight to an interview.

As I arrived at Brisbane airport I received an SMS stating that my Jetstar flight from Cairns to Osaka has been cancelled. It took 90 minutes before Jetstar provided a solution- a flight on Qantas to Tokyo not Osaka. So I arrived late at night, miles from Osaka and had to arrange bullet train to Nagoya at my expense. This was my second Jetstar international flight that Jetstar cancelled and transferred the recovery costs to me. Behind schedule I decided to return on the same flight but extend for five days. The Jetstar Indian based dialogue centre tried to charge me $630 to change my flight. I rejected and used the ""manage my flight"" option. I was charged $300. My complaint letter to Jetstar was acknowledged, by a corporate apologist who stated that I had changed my return route. I hadn't changed my route - I changed the day.

I cannot comment on the actual flight as it hasn't happened yet, but I'm thinking I won't even be getting on the plane. I flew from Minneapolis to Auckland, visiting New Zealand on holiday before I start my working holiday visa in Australia. I do not have any solid travel dates but knew that I had to be in Australia by April 16th. I was told at the ticket counter that I could not board unless I had a flight out of New Zealand. This is my fault as I misunderstood the conditions of traveling into a country via visitor's visa vs. a working holiday visa. I was under the impression I could enter the country as long as I had enough money to purchase a flight out of the country. I had to book my flight at the ticket counter and fast since my flight was about to leave. I booked through kayak.com. I purchased insurance as I was under the impression I could use it to change or cancel my flight if I needed to. Apparently, kayak has their settings set to round trip by default and I accidentally booked a flight out of Auckland to Sydney on March 7th and then right back to Auckland from Sydney on March 8th in less than 24 hours. I noticed this mistake on my layover in Los Angeles and called the airline immediately to try and get a refund for the return ticket. Usually airlines will let you cancel of change your flight within 24 hours of the booking. Not Jetstar. They will do nothing to help me. I've talked to their customer service team about 4 or 5 times and they do not care about their customers. They won't even offer me a refund via voucher. The insurance I purchased to Allianz is a farce as well. The box I checked to purchase the insurance said it covered cancellations and changes to your flight. What they don't mention is that it only covers cancellations of changes if you or your travel companion is injured or ill and you must provide extensive proof of this.

We have already boarded the aircraft and waited on the ground for about an hour which made us miss our connecting flight to Auckland. Ground staff was a bit slow on giving us information about what was going on which made some of us very stressed and uncomfortable. The connecting flight that we were meant to be on had already left at 11.05pm when we arrived at 12am. Jetstar gave us accommodation and told us that we were on the next flight out which was at 9.10am but due to the immigration not giving us Indonesians visas we were unable to go to the hotel which meant we had to make ourselves comfortable in the transit area (which weirdly you had to call someone to open the door for you, it is so impractical when you are in a rush). We were given food vouchers worth $20 each (no shops were open at that time so we were starving). We were going to get our boarding tickets at the gate and the ground service were very aggressive and so unfriendly and rude which put us off so much. Overall, the cabin staff were alright but I've seen happier more friendlier cabin staff on other airlines. I recommend that Jetstar should really get their services to prioritise customers that have had disrupted flights and also train their staff to be more friendly and not so rude and aggressive. It would have made it more pleasant if the ground staff were more helpful and informative. Also on the flight from Auckland to Denpasar via Melbourne, our baggage had been left in Melbourne for around 3/4 days. Our baggage was meant to be checked in all the way through to Denpasar but obviously did this not happen. Not sure who to blame, Melbourne airport or Jetstar but this is really not a good way to start a holiday.

That I was okay with, however, what I found somewhat appalling was the nearly 45 minute wait to be checked in, as Jetstar have cut down staffing levels to just three team members checking in my flight and another flight to Melbourne (some 300 people in total), which left me with little time to enjoy the sights of this small but wonderful airport. Boarding was efficient, and I was also allocated an exit row seat upon my check-in. However, the crew were very robotic, and even though this was only a flight of some 90 minutes to Sydney, just did not seem to be interested or attentive. With the exception of the in-flight magazine, there was no entertainment available, and the rather limited in-flight menu made me regret not purchasing something at the airport (Vietnamese ""Pho"" was little more than a cup-a-soup with bits of meat in it). Overall, Jetstar just doesn't seem to be as good a carrier as it was just a few years ago, and when compared to recent flight experiences on Tiger Airways, doesn't seem to provide that memorable flight experience, especially where service, catering and crew are concerned.

I was travelling in New Zealand and I received an email from Jetstar informing me that my flight on 4th December to Kuala Lumpur had been cancelled. There was no back-up plan nor any other flight options made available except to call the customer service team. The next available flight was the following day – the 5th (the original date I booked) and which we were told that we could confirm our presence 3 hours prior to the departure time. We called back 12 hours later and we were told that nothing could be done because the flight is now full. We needed to wait for 2 more days for the next available flight. When we asked if we could book other tickets back to Kuala Lumpur with the cost fully reimbursed the customer service answered that this is subject to the approval from the claims department. It is obvious that booking flights at such a last minute will be extremely costly, which defeats the purpose of purchasing the cheap fares from Jetstar months in advance. So no flight, no other options, except to accept the refund of the money paid or wait for the next flight out. To add on, the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful. Upon checking-in in New Zealand for our flights back to Melbourne, we spoke to the customer service at the airport. In less than 15 minutes, they confirmed 2 seats for us for the 5th December which was what we have been told that the flight was full. Fast forward to the day of the flight (2 days later) – once again another frustrating e-mail which stated a delay in the flight from 1200 hour to 1350 hour. Bearing in mind that we have a transit at the Singapore airport, the email stated arrival time to be 1840 hour whilst the departure from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was at 1945 hours. However on the plane, the captain announced that the ETA was at 1930. Logically speaking, we expected that the Jetstar crew would have had the information for passengers who are transiting in Singapore for the KL flight. Hence, they would have been aware that the Melbourne flight was delayed thus wait for these us to arrive. On our way there we even heard them calling out name, so I immediately stop by the information counter to request for them to hold the gate as our flights were delayed. The gate was closed when we arrived. We explained ourselves, but once again nothing could be done despite already having our boarding pass in hand. They even checked our seat numbers but still the same answer. At the transfer counter, I was told by the airport staff that the flight we had just missed was the last flight out. And to top it all, the representative only showed up after close to 2 hours later. No apologies, nothing. It was as if nothing had happened and we should be thankful for the arrangements made. When it was our turn, he quickly briefed us on the flight to be taken then next day and the accommodation provided for the night. I asked if we had any other options and all he answered was no because that was the last flight and that is all they can do. I even asked if we could book any other available flight and get Jetstar to reimburse the full cost.

Their call center organized seats on a Qantas domestic to Sydney and connected to Qantas to Bangkok. The call center were deceptive in not disclosing there were no business class seats available on either leg. When asked the seat numbers we were told these would be allocated at the airport. At the terminal when all was disclosed Jetstar after 12minutes wait advised to see the Jetstar staff at the terminal. Our Qantas flight was due to leave at 6.30am, Jetstar staff don't start work till 7am. This flight was our only option to make our connection in Bangkok. After our holiday and 2 days before Bangkok we found our seating allocated Bangkok to Singapore as 1A & 1B. We boarded Jetstar Asia to find their is no business class and apparently you order meals in advance on their web site but non of this was ever advised and so no meals were provided. A coffee was $4.

Please Jetstar, you shouldn't have. Upon arriving at Gold Coast, I promptly paid the $50 fee and queued for the baggage drop. The agent at the baggage drop informed me that I was over the allowable limit for my checked baggage. Being familiar with airport procedures, I said ""Ok, just let me put the excess into my carry-on."" He replied by asking me to put my carry-on as well as my laptop (?) on the scale. He then informed me that I was 16kg overweight. I reluctantly agreed to pay for it, until he informed me that it would cost me $240 additional. So if I were to have taken that offer, I would have paid almost 4X the advertised price at a whopping $440. Thanks Jetstar! I went back to the help desk and there was a lot of hand wringing.

It did not feel like a normal flight on another aircraft type, but it instead felt much worse than that. We already had a 30mins delay waiting for pushback from Bali's Ngurah Rai airport, for a reason the pilot did not even announce. Additionally it was a red-eye flight, which means that sleep is important on such flight. However this is the least duration of sleep I could ever get on a red eye flight which will be explained further below. Mood lighting was there but not effective at all. The IFE was there with a responsive touchscreen, although money is required to pay for most of the IFE content. Seats were horrible. Leather seats are not at all comfortable, inhibits sleep, as well as those hard headrests that felt very weird to adjust. Seat itself was very narrow at less than 17 inches, and armrest was ridiculously narrow not a hand can comfortably rest on them. The seat pitch was also very narrow at what felt like 30 inches, extremely cramped, and all these contributed to my sleeplessness. What's more the plane was scorching hot, so more than an hour of sleep seems like an incredible feat to do on such a plane. Meal was bland, only the sauce had a slight bit of flavour, although the dessert made up for the bad food. Cabin crew were average with nothing remarkable to speak of. The same can be said on the return flight. Hot plane, narrow seats, bland food but with great deserts, average crew, same IFE.

As a result of a minor problem with Australian visa and Jetstar refusal to assist, we missed the first leg of international flights and had to re-book. This resulted in spending two nights on airport floors, loss of a paid hotel accomodation, and re-booking fees. The visa was a very minor issue, and a competing airline a few feet away took care of the matter for us in a matter of minutes after Jetstar refusal. Unfortunately, Jetstar had closed the boarding gate and we missed the flight. The counter personnel at the Queenstown airport were extemely rude. In addition, the Jetstar website is very confusing. At the time of purchasing tickets one month in advance, I paid $50 luggage fees. At the time of boarding, we were charged $420 additional fees for two pieces of luggage. The fees were paid and at the next stop in Auckland enroute to Melbourne, the agent attempted to collect additional luggage fees. Again, the personnel were extemely rude and required receipts for the previous payment because the computer didn't contain records. We contested these charges after returning home, but received only long-winded explanations as to why Jetstar bore no responsiblity. This is the absolute worst airline and the most expensive of all the flights due to luggage fees, re-booking, lost hotel charges.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ZQN,MEL,,March 2016,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,1.0

I had a choice for the same price, between Cathay Pacific in economy via Hong Kong or Jetstar in business class via Cairns. Jetstar had more convenient timings so I took the chance. Then I panicked because the ticket and the website indicated that I would have to collect my bags in Cairns and check back in. However, at check-in in Melbourne, I was given both boarding passes and my bags were checked through to Tokyo - this seems to be the norm for the Tokyo and Osaka flights but I can’t find anywhere where I was told that in advance. A good thing, too, since the Melbourne-Cairns flight left 63 minutes late despite boarding on time (they’ve got a reputation to maintain). The flight to Cairns had no business section so I was stuck in economy in an exit row seat, plenty of room but next to the noisy galley and toilets. The Boeing 787’s electronically-dimmed windows just don’t work in direct sun and my head got very hot and it was impossible to sleep. The quieter engines don’t translate into a quieter cabin - seems like some machinery is very loud, perhaps for the higher cabin pressures (the higher pressures may however have reduced the screaming from the usual gaggle of families). On the the Cairns-Tokyo leg I was in the first “business” row and it’s directly equivalent to premium economy elsewhere. The seat actually felt less roomy than the Cathay Pacific premium economy I was in a few weeks ago, even though 2x3x2 in a 787 should have more space than 2x3x2 in the narrower A330.

They explained that I had only purchased one bag and that I no longer had the option of adding a suitcase to my fare. They informed me that I was 23 kilos over and that would cost me $350.00.

Having put in our claim for reimbursement, we have been advised by Jetstar that as a booking of four passengers, we were only going to be reimbursed SGD$150 for all four of us for accommodation (it is impossible to get a reasonable room in Singapore for 4 people at this rate).

2016-01-17,3,New Zealand,,"""doubt I will use them again""","Singapore to Melbourne with Jetstar Airways business class. Boeing 787 new and quite quiet in the front. Hate the electronic window shading, was in control of the cabin staff so it was either all open or all dark. It was a night flight and I was watching the huge fires and some wicked lightening storms till they darkened the windows for people to sleep. Sorry but what was happening out the window was better than the in-seat entertainment. The seat has plenty of leg room but I don't think there was one seat where the recline/foot rest worked properly - there was a lot of times when the cabin crew were wrestling with seat. Recline is huge but you're reclining into the space of the person behind you. It happened to me - the tiny TV drops to where you can't view it unless your neck is double-jointed. You can't get up to go to the toilet without some contortions and using the headrest of the seat in front and then you receive that disgusted look because you woke them up.  Entertainment small screen was just that, small, very small and not great quality. And I ran out of movies to watch about 3 hours from touchdown on a 7.5 hour flight. What an awful poor choice - and in Business class! Food not quite as good as other airlines economy food. I was in row 2 of business class and they ran out of the first choice in row 2. Well actually they didn't run out because our friends (also in row 2) shortly after being fobbed off with the fish, noted that row 2 and 3 of the other side of the business cabin got the first choice. So that's a bit of an insult to be told that it's out to then watch people being served it after you. First choice - a Pie, no veggies, no potatoes, nothing but a pie! Had to check I was in business class! Drinks offer a good choice, and always there if you wanted it. Cabin staff were mainly good and attentive (not that we wanted much) but a bit disappointed with the lack of checking for meals. Goodies Pack was great:- earplugs, eye mask, toothbrush, tube socks (not so great), hand cream, lip balm, neck pillow and the bag it came in can be used as a computer tablet bag. There is one thing that all airlines should realize; tube socks don't work in the toilet (think about it). Ground service I've marked low for one reason - although we were the first off the plane we were last away from the baggage carousel as our bags came out last (that will teach us to be first at the airport!) Business class baggage came out last! Overall the whole thing was very amateurish, I wasn't expecting top of the line business class, but it should have been up to at least premium economy standards of other airlines. Not sure how they can market this as business class.

First they told me I'd be getting my baggage the next day- which I thought was reasonable. Now, they're telling me that they can't do anything about it and that my baggage will only come the day before I'm due to leave Cairns. All they said was that they will reimburse me the money I need to get new clothes and toiletries - when I send them the receipts. Firstly, my chargers are all in my baggage and my electronics are dying. Secondly, I only have a mere few days here and buying new toiletries wasn't on my itinerary. In fact, I don't even have time for it. Jetstar managed to screw my whole week up just because of their incompetence. It's not about the money I need to spend buying new things, it's the time that I don't have. Why should I have to suffer for their negligence. After calling them, which they clearly did not take me seriously, all the operator could say was ""we can't do anything"". The operator was unhelpful and snobbish. I am not after the compensation, I just wanted to know how they are able to help. Such cases have happened to me and I received my baggage within 24 hours (Singapore Airlines). I am now currently stuck in Cairns with nothing but a phone and a dying laptop and my whole trip ruined, while they insist on not providing any other help.

Naturally we called a flight attendant over who ordered us out of the seats and gave them to that young couple. The flight attendant told us to move to a window and middle seat in the back of the plane. These days one does not argue with flight attendants or they throw you off the plane so we just gave in.

Magazines were well worn despite only being midway through the month and a previous passenger had left their boarding pass in the seat pocket from a few months ago. Check in queue was quite long but it moved along ok. However at Brisbane it was inconvenient that they did the handcarry size and weight check after check-in which meant queuing up 4 times before actually boarding and made worse with the lack of seats immediately at the gate because they put the flight next to several other minor routes instead of some priority spacing unlike other carriers had set up. Booking the flight through the Jetstar website was good. The interface was easy enough and the early check-in feature and early seat selection are big drawcards for me. I think its a great idea for the cabin crew to direct passengers to their seat because one of them omitted this on my flight down to Brisbane and it meant someone took my seat by mistake until I pointed this out to the cabin crew.

I was informed that if I did this I would have to pay for the flight again as it was not to the same airport and that I would not be refunded.

As a result, I missed my international connection from Brisbane. When as suggested I contacted Jetstar by phone, I went through their voice recognition system which was aggravatingly useless, and ended up giving the same information that the useless computer system had requested to a live person in the Philippines. Fortunately my employer has a policy of never using Jetstar if an alternative is available so I have rebooked on another airline.

2015-09-07,1,Spain,,"""take sterner action with troublemakers""","On a family holiday in Australia we chose Jetstar to fly from Sydney to Cairns. On arriving at Sydney T2 we found that we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the scheduled 15.20 departure. This meant trying to find somewhere to sit in a heavily overcrowded departure lounge while guarding our luggage. The preferred method of checking in seemed to be using one of a row of machines which very efficiently printed our boarding cards and luggage labels. But when we went to the ""Bag Drop"" we were told to wait at the back of the queue. I'm still not sure if everybody in front of us had already checked in at the machine or not. The Jetstar staff member at check-in weighed our 4 hold cases. We'd paid for four x 20 kgs, but all of them only came to 70 kgs. We knew we were allowed 7 kgs per person for hand luggage. When we were asked to redistribute 2 kgs. weight from one case into other pieces of hand luggage which were underweight, we were shocked. We were 10 kgs under on hold baggage! A little common sense would show that we'd already paid more than enough for extra luggage. We'd flown Tigerair from Melbourne to Sydney and their luggage policy seemed far more reasonable - same weight restrictions but as long as the total does not exceed your limit it doesn't matter how it is distributed. Onboard we had serious problems with fellow passengers. We were seated together 27C my wife, 27D myself, 27E my daughter's boyfriend and 27F my daughter. There were 7 men aged 28-35ish seated 25C,D,E,F and 26D,E and F. They were very boisterous from the start, shouting and swearing at each other. Then they ordered beers repeatedly until one of the attendants refused to serve them more alcohol. They became more rowdy and then the one in 26F dropped a can of beer which rolled against my daughter's handbag. When she drew his attention to this they rounded on her giving her ""the finger"". I told them to be careful and they called me a ""rat"". The attendant came and asked them to calm down but it was having no effect. The ringleader appeared to be in 25F. He pressed the call button and told the attendant that I was annoying him by ""reading too loud"" he could ""hear my thoughts"". He looked at me and put his forked fingers to his eyes and then pointed them at me, in true Hollywood gangster style! I felt threatened and concerned for my family's well being. I was worried that they'd all come up to us at the baggage claim. As it happened the only thing was that 25F ran past and bumped into my arm on purpose. I feel the cabin crew allowed this situation to escalate. The entire rear of the plane had to put up with this childish behaviour for three hours. They even shouted at infants to 'Shush"". The staff should have threatened them with calling ahead to Cairns Airport Police to be waiting. This may have served to quieten them down.  Why can't Jetstar allow check-in earlier than 2 hours? I know I have done it with other airlines and it cuts down the queuing tremendously. Why don't Jetstar adopt a total weight luggage policy and show clearly if baggage drop is operational? Why didn't Jetstar cabin crew take sterner action with these 7 troublemakers?",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney,Cairns,,September 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,no,2.0,5.0,

I told her I had no hold luggage and she then insisted on looking at my carry on bag and weighing it. It was 300g over the 7kg limit and said I'd have to pay and check it in.

I was actually traveling from Vancouver to SYD, and broke up the trip by flying Air Canada YVR-HNL return for about $550, and the Jetstar for about $1100 (plus all the extras). I had to stay one night in HNL each way, adding $500 hotel. With the Jetstar extras the cost perhaps $500 less than a direct flight. Plus I was trying to break up the 15/16 hour nonstop flight duration.  Jetstar : I had a cordial reception checking in at HNL. The rest of the staff throughout the rest of the trip were indifferent. The Boeing 787 is a nice airplane, as they go. I paid extra for a good seat, which was a great boon on full flights. That was good value for money. I paid $40-ish for the meal: it was a rude joke both times. The meal was mushy, minimal and miserable, and you needed to wait 15 minutes for a drink to wash it down. The most demeaning part of the experience was getting dinged $125 for my 5 kilos overweight baggage on my return. There wasn't a weight scale where I was staying, so I couldn't have prepared myself for the problem. My carry-on backpack was at the carry-on weight limit, so I couldn't switch items into that. So it was either pay the money or toss out some of my clothes. I paid, and then fumed for the next hour or two. The only way Jetstar can avoid this kind of rude greeting for a customer would be to give staff some leeway on the overweight rule. But they were very stern. In most of the reviews people are willing to forgive Jetstar's faults because of the lower prices. I don't agree. A price is a price and a fault is a fault. If Jetstar worked on its faults, and upped its prices slightly, it could delight customers instead of annoying them, as it so often does.

When we arrived check in had just opened and there were only 2 staff checking baggage. Got our baggage tag and got in the queue. Then they proceeded to call out every single passenger whose flight were departing before ours, regardless of where they were in the queue. At one point the front line stood still for more than 49 minutes whilst jet star personnel were pulling people out of the other lanes and getting them checked in. When we finally got seen - after a riot nearly broke out - the check in guy told us we had less than 5 minutes to get through security and make our flight. We had to run like mad. Our flight was at 6:05 am!  I don't care about the pay per use for extra stuff like bags, food, seat assignments etc - it's a nuisance but fine. I'll pay, as long as I get the service. The lack of a coordinated path to check baggage for passengers and poor organization at the airport is simply not acceptable and no cheap airfare makes this worth the anxiety! It is maddening and made me angry and resentful. I can't believe this airline is a Qantas offshoot. In the end don't bother with the 2 hours early part. It does not make any difference trust me!! At least not for domestic flights departing Melbourne. Get there 45 minutes before your flight, flag a staff member and tell them your flight is boarding now and you'll get right up the front of the queue and wave bye bye to the poor sops who play by the rules.

In row 2 of Business Class, I had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. There is an inherent design problem with JQ's configuration: Row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts Row 2 seats' access and space. When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms. The food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 Business Class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front.

We had chosen email as preferred mode of contact as we did not have mobile access in Bali, but no email received to date. When we got to the airport our flight was the only one with no boarding gate listed for a couple of hours until about 30 minutes before flight, we watched the plane landing then we got a gate. Again we were delayed with no reasons given and got back to Australia at about 9.30 pm. There was no hot food available on the flight except noodles!

2015-06-12,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"Our flight from Sydney to Honolulu was cancelled after standing in line for 3 hrs. Tired frustrated customers then had to be insulted by the Jetstar spokesman who simply kept reiterating that any costs involved in missed forward flights, accommodation etc were our fault if we had not taken out travel insurance – he likened it to hiring a car. I researched 5 different travel insurance providers and none would insure against an airline cancelling their own flight only against weather. Jetstar did not reply to my query as to whether our flight was cancelled due to engineering problems and if so why wasn’t another aircraft provided or due to an unfilled flight which several passengers had been told was the reason. Jetstar did offer $60 vouchers with an expiry date of 6 months – I asked if these could be transferred or extended as we did not intend to travel in that period and of course the response was no. The cancelled flight caused many passengers grief, in our case it set the stage for a nightmare 5 days of missed ongoing flights with huge rebooking fees (being Easter it was a nightmare getting seats on flights), missed hire car bookings, missed hotel and car hire, lost luggage meaning the same clothes for 5 days. Jetstar customer service responded that 'Section 9.1 of our Conditions of Carriage does state that flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us. This information is available on our website and you agree to it when you make your booking.' Jetstar is not a cheap airline, in fact there are times it is more expensive than Qantas and Virgin – we booked Jetstar because it fitted in with our dates. United Airlines and Delta Airlines were both involved in our 5 missed flights and both were amazingly helpful in getting us from Honolulu to New York and even changed our flight for the second time without charge – why can’t Jetstar treat its passengers with the same consideration.

Flight attendants looked professional and lovely. Nice uniforms. Excellent professional conduct by cabin crew. Aircraft was clean. We had seat 17E & 17D seats were comfortable. Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags. I have not come across this on a Jetstar flight in the past. Overall a very good flight and this is a very good low cost carrier.

We could have gone economy but I'm well over 6 feet and didn't fancy that. So it was a good compromise.

As it was an evening flight we checked the Jetstar website throughout the day to ensure that our flight was not delayed before heading to the airport. On arrival at 3.30pm we were told the flight had been delayed until 4.00am. The reason was fog over Perth however we watched as other reputable airlines departed as scheduled. We were each given 'meal' vouchers which turned out to be to the value of approx. $7.15 - not enough to purchase a meal from any of the airport vendors. When we approached Jetstar for further compensation they did not provide any. We were forced to spend 12 hours waiting in Changi airport watching time pass. When the flight eventually did depart (after 4am following a long delay on the Tarmac) we were then brought the dinner meals that had been pre-purchased when we believed we would be flying out in the evening! Not being interested in eating dinner at 6.30am this was further money wasted.

2015-04-20,6,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,ADL-DPS-MEL. Bought Jetstar tickets through Qantas as it was seemingly the only way to get sensible domestic connection from CBR. Price was nothing special. Bags were bang on 20kg if not a whisker over but a blind eye was shown which was a relief. They didn't weigh hand luggage at the gate. ADL-DPS sector was on a domestic A320 which was old dirty and the magazines in our seats were all torn. The seats were either developed by a bus builder or just stuffed judging by our numb behinds for the 5-hour flight. Crew fine and I gather ADL based. Disappointingly half the menu was unavailable as tragic as the choices are - they really aren't trying it really is lowest common denominator and undrinkable wine. DPS-MEL sector was on new B787 with Australian pilots but all Thai flight attendants. New Denpasar Airport is excellent very efficient even if the air con is a bit changeable. You can buy duty free (unlike other ports in Asia on flights to Aus?) which is bagged and given to you at the gate. First time on 787 and the big windows and nicer cabin humidity/pressure seemed to make a difference. I got a good sleep couldn't complain too much about seat or pitch.

I have to put my hand up and admit that my wife and I have only traveled with Jetstar once some years ago. From the outset (booking your tickets) the experience was horrendous with each separate step being asked if we wish to purchase an add on. And the number of times where we were reminded that carry on luggage that breached the weight limits (which apparently have recently been reduced) would be severely penalised and baggage placed in the hold. On our flight to Hobart passengers were called to board the aircraft then spent 20 minutes in a holding pen waiting to board. The flight left 20 minutes late. On our return journey from Hobart we arrived at the recommended 60 minutes before departure time to be told that the plane had been delayed and would be an hour late arriving which eventuality extended to two hours late arriving and departing.

2015-04-04,,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Appalling. Unreliable. Outward flight delayed. Plane not clean. Rubbish lolly wrappers under seat in front. Return flight cancellation announced on almost indecipherable loudspeaker only 10 mins before boarding time then flashed up on screen at Boarding Gate. Such late notice (none received by SMS) left many stranded and those with already checked in baggage unable to transfer to another airline in time. We were forced to sit at airport an additional 4 hours to be seated on their next plane. Staff claimed Captain had called in sick. Surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in. To cap it off purported staff shortage on arrival at Tullamarine meant a further delay as cabin crew unable to open doors to allow already disgruntled passengers to disembark. No apologies. Not even an offer of a complimentary tea coffee or water in flight for those affected. Very bad PR. Don't try to speak to Senior Management about your experience or have them contact you - Jetstar claim they have no direct line. First and last time we travel with this airline. Booked through Qantas who code share. Have travelled other Qantas code share internationally on several occasions and never had an issue. Jetstar is low budget low everything. Never again never.,,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,2.0,,1,no,1.0,1.0,

I used Qantas Frequent Flyer points for this flight and couldn't check in online beforehand either on the Qantas or Jetstar websites. The flight was smooth and the service was efficient. However the seating was much tighter than on the Virgin E190 I had used a few days earlier. A kid behind me kept kicking the seat.

I find the flight staff to be extremely friendly and helpful with all aspects of flying. On the way to Hobart we had a very friendly air hostess and when she learnt it was my youngest boy's first time on a plane she said she may have a surprise for them and she left for a few minutes and upon her return explained we could go into the cockpit and meet the pilots and let the boys have a look around when we touch down. So friendly and the boys loved seeing inside the pilots world. Being a person who fears flying both trips were smooth and hassle free. I'm not a small lady but I found the seats comfy enough.

We paid extra for the exit row seats and had plenty of legroom as my husband is 6 foot tall so was happy to pay considering we were still saving on the cost of other airlines. The seats we had were airplane comfortable same as any other airline. Yes they didn't have food or entertainment however it's a 3 hour domestic flight so we just took out own food and put some movies on the tablet to watch together.

2015-03-20,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,MEL-BKK in economy on B787. Sort of your typical Jetstar experience. Cramped cabin little leg room nickel and dimed for everything. Add to this the fact that the in seat power and overhead reading light wasn't working (despite a few reset attempts) and it added up to a fairly unremarkable experience. Jetstar has also changed their check in for international flights at MEL adding slick new kiosks which generate boarding passes and baggage tags. All well and good however there is no longer a separate queue for online check ins necessitating a long wait in the single check in queue. Absolutely no value to a customer to check in online now - don't waste your time.

Returning we were scheduled to fly from Singapore to Jetstar on the 2.20am flight. On arrival we saw that the flight was listed as 'cancelled'. We proceeded to speak with ground staff who vehemently denied any knowledge of flight cancellation and to their understanding the flight was still scheduled for departure as planned. We proceeded to check in and entered the departure gates. 2 hours prior to departure announced that the boarding gate had been changed. We went to this new arbitrary gate number but there was no boarding or ground staff in the vicinity. We waited patiently for 1.5 hrs 20 minutes prior to scheduled departure another passenger arrived to inform us he had confirmation that the flight had been cancelled. We were left to seek out the Jetstar information counter at which point the counter manned by 2 young and inexperienced staff members was swarmed by hundreds of passengers both from the cancelled flight as well as passengers from other flights seeking out their departure tickets. It was 2 hours before we were able to speak with a Jetstar ground staff who informed us 'they would place us on the next available flight - which could possibly be the flight on the following day or even a few days down the road if a seat could not be secured.' When asked about how passengers could go about making claims or trying to find alternative flights out of Singapore Jetstar staff could only offer a measly piece of photocopied information sheet explaining that the flight was cancelled and that should passengers choose to find their own alternative flight carrier that this would mean Jetstar bears no responsibility in fully refunding claims.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,1.0,,1,no,3.0,0.0,

2015-03-09,3,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,JQ58 DPS-BNE. Red-eye flight which was delayed by an hour departing 0035. This was our first flight with Jetstar in business class but paid for with QFF points (classic award). This apparently meant no entitlement to lounge access at Denpasar as ticket class was insufficient +/- we hadn't requested lounge access? (Had no idea we were meant to). This was an unhappy start to the flight as we'd been hanging out for a shower after a long day in Bali. Initial impression favourable staff friendly. Drinks offered and delivered promptly food order taken. Downhill from there. Partner's meal failed to materialise - seemed like everyone was getting meals in dribs and drabs (low staffing numbers?) so we kept waiting. Gave up when we realised staff had disappeared and cabin was asleep for the night. (Yes could have followed up but we were dead on our feet and preferred to sleep). The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes. No pillow only blow up neck rest in comfort packs. Entertainment system (screen in armrest) and headphones ok but choices limited compared to other airlines. Wouldn't use them again but options limited from DPS to Australia. Compared to Qantas very poor indeed.,,,,,,,,1.0,3.0,,3,no,2.0,4.0,

The following night I was given a note under my door saying to get to the airport at 12.00am so assumed again that our flight was delayed again. Yes it was it wasn't leaving until 3.00am! When ringing Jetstar and going onto their website I was told that it was still leaving at 12.45am and again the website said that as well. Many frustrated and angry customers we all proceeded to the airport. No one at Jetstar knew what was going on and after waiting for over an hour a non Jetstar customer service lady proceeded to tell us that it wasn't leaving until 3.00am.

Amazingly for such a new plane we were not the only one on the flight with this problem. The way JetStar have designed their entertainment unit is if it's unresponsive like ours were not only do you not get video but you cannot turn on the overhead light or call an attendant. It's all integrated in with each other. Due to the Dreamliner windows automatically shading out while mid flight we had to sit there in the dark with no entertainment or reading.

In all fairness the Captain did the correct thing and didn't take off - he kept us all up updated via the loud speaker. Finally took off 2 hours later. Missed my connecting flight - then had to go on stand by - what a joy that was. The actual trip back to Aust was a very smooth flight - very little noise. Cabin crew were quite good.

Would I Fly Star Class Internationally again? Most defiantly - Its far cheaper and you still get the feel that your special. I would sooner pocket the savings I would make on traveling with Jetstar B/C to Qantas B/C.

2015-02-24,2,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"Sydney to Honolulu (Business Class) on 10 February 2015. The moment I got into my seat I was taken down ""memory lane"" of the 1990's. The seat of Jetstar's Business Class was exactly the same seat taken when you're flying Business Class in the 1990's. The only thing that was added were the two in-seat power points. Makes me suspect that Jetstar/Qantas cut corners by re-using the old Business Class seats from old airframes and installed them here. Like the old Business Class seats the in-flight entertainment (IFE) is a very bulky iPad with equally bulky battery pack. The first meal dinner I was given a choice of two dishes. After dinner I ordered for black coffee 15 minutes later my ordered arrived as coffee with milk/coffee. I ordered Scotch after dinner and it arrived 20 minutes later as Scotch and soda. For breakfast I was given two choices: Take it or leave it. This is where Jetstar cuts costs again. Instead of hot meal you're given a bowl of cereals. The seats were hard and I didn't sleep a wink because it was just plain difficult to lean back. Personally I wouldn't recommend anyone to bother buying Business Class as it is really not worth it. I have flown Business Class (Cathay Pacific) and Premium Economy (Air New Zealand) and Jetstar's Business Class is BELOW (in standard) compared to Air New Zealand's Premium Economy.

We were lucky to get seats on the 12.45am flight however the seats at the very back of the plane ""designated for cabin crew.""

I have just returned from a holiday to Bali and flew Jetstar. I was actually quite excited to be flying the 787 for the first time after all the hype about comfort air quality bigger windows and low noise levels. What an enormous disappointment. Jetstar have managed to take such an advanced and modern aircraft and jam it with cramped seats down in economy with terrible leg room. I am not even that big 175cm. It looks like they had a team from Tupperware design and install the entire interior of this plane. Plastic everywhere. The food (pre-purchased) was marginal at best and it'll cost you $10 to watch a movie. You go to all that trouble of installing screens in the back of the seat and it seemed hardly anyone bothered paying. The actual inflight experience (bigger windows air quality and smooth flight) was OK - and I am looking forward to flying the 787 again with an airline that actually designed a cabin with a hint of passenger comfort in mind.

The food which was better than previous flights. My return flight JQ23 from MEL to Tokyo NRT - a very disappointing experience in 20 years of business travel. Check-in was the best customer handling that I had experienced with Jetstar. Two hours later at the gate the boarding process was mismanaged and turned into a stampede of economy and business class passengers jostling for access at the same time. Staff were flustered and lost control. The cabin crew communication customer handling and courtesy was very good. I appreciated their efforts and acknowledge that Jetstar standards has improved. The worst Business Class meal - 3 choices chicken and noodle pea and cheese soup or Hamburger ""raked"" sliced pork. The meal arrived - the hamburger was a dry reheated toasted sandwich with two pickles and mustard. Not a hamburger. One thin slice of pork between soggy reheated toast and pickles. This was not an optional snack this was the main course standard for business class. It gets worse the desert was two shortbread cookies and no tea or coffee. The breakfast was good with fruit yoghurt juice. I requested tea which was cold. I hadn't realised that Jetstar had included an inflatable neck cushion in the the comfort pack - a thoughtful and beneficial improvement however when I tried to brush my teeth before landing the tooth paste was missing and there was no paper cups in the toilet. These basic products are important. I can't brush my teeth so the comfort pack became ineffective. Jetstar is a budget airline it is not Singapore Airlines so fair assessment is needed considering value-for-money. Jetstar has made many improvements with cabin crew and ground staff customer handling skills. As I confirmed in my flight ex-Japan Jetstar can provide good food that meets business class expectations. However the toasted sandwich and cookies main course has me questioning whether my next flight to Australia in August should be with another airline. Jetstar's weak point - it cannot sustain a basic standard the difference between the two flight experiences was huge.

The flight itself was okay but the amount of legroom was very limited making me uncomfortable. Departed 35 minutes behind schedule and arrived 25 minutes late. As Jetstar is a budget airline I was not expecting high standards however the quality was disappointing. Next time I would be more than happy to spend a little extra to fly Qantas or Virgin.,,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,2.0,,3,no,1.0,1.0,
2015-01-11,3,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Poor trip with Jetstar will be happy if I never travel with them again. Our direct flight was cancelled Sydney to Phuket and we were then sent through Sydney-Melbourne-Phuket meaning an extra few hours before we even left Australia. Once on board our Melbourne Phuket plane the seats were quite comfortable. Meal times were different we had paid and pre-ordered meals but no they had no record of that even though it was printed on our ticket. This meant we had no meals as only those prepaid and recorded were put on board. We could then purchase a toasted sandwich or pie most uninteresting and unsatisfying.

Everyone knows that Christmas week is very busy with long queues at the airport but Jetstar could make it much easier for passengers at Tullamarine by having a dedicated bag drop queue. Then there would be some point to checking in at home. The long queue that I had to join included both people who had already checked in and others who hadn't. After being called out of the queue to catch my plane there was a long wait in the airless dungeon that passes for Jetstar's terminal - then a late gate change which led us back into the Qantas terminal -- and then a long motionless queue with no information. Finally we were able to board around 30 minutes late. Once on the plane the journey was fine. The seat was comfortable and the service was friendly. There was a long wait at Hobart for luggage probably due to the arrival of another Jetstar aircraft minutes before ours. The return journey could not have been more different. Quick efficient check-in and boarding a comfortable seat (I was offered an exit row seat at check-in) and arrival in Melbourne 20 minutes early. However at baggage pick-up we followed the signs to carousel 1 where we waited for a long time before finding out that our luggage was spinning around carousel 4 (with no signs).,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,4.0,,4,yes,0.0,0.0,

We did even get a drink from the ground staff. Only when we approached the staff then we realized we had to stay in Bangkok for another night. Without giving proper instructions we were lead like blind mice around the airport. We waited again for more than half an hour before we were transported to a hotel near the airport.

Comfortable seat although it is a recliner one and not lie flat. Plenty of legroom in row 1.

When I was unable to get my boarding pass I approached the help desk. At the time I managed to speak with an assistant it was exactly 30 min before my scheduled Melbourne bound service. The service clerk informed me that I am now late for my flight and all other flights to Melbourne are fully booked and I can only fly the next morning.

2014-11-25,1,United Kingdom,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Flew between Sydney and Uluru. The flights themselves were what you would expect from a budget airline. The check-in process however was a total shambles. At Sydney Airport there was just one long line for all their departures. Using the automated check-in machines was a waste of time - when we eventually reached the check-in desk the baggage tags we'd carefully put on were unceremoniously ripped off. We were still in the middle of the long line having arrived two hours before our scheduled departure time when we heard someone shouting our flight number. With great difficulty we managed to extricate ourselves and baggage from 'the maze'. Eventually we found the check-in desk where our flight number was being shouted. The check-in clerks were complaining to each other that they weren't being sent the right passengers. The return flight from Uluru wasn't much better despite being the only departure that afternoon. At the check-in they waited until all the passengers arrived before they very slowly began the process. Very galling to watch them sitting behind the check-in desks doing nothing while we all stood in line. Even when they did condescend to start work they seemed to believe that chatting between themselves was a higher priority than dealing with their customers. Value for money?

I had just driven to Brisbane as Qantas do not go to the Sunshine Coast. When I arrived at Jetstar there was just one girl attending to the baggage drop. I was eventually given my boarding pass and allocated seat 17. The Jetstar representative checking the cabin luggage was very officious. I lined up and the representative said to weigh my handbag computer and fascinator for the Cup the fascinator weighed nothing the total weight was well under 10kgs. The fascinator was damaged during this process. I asked if I could just carry the fascinator on board then she said you can only have 2 bags. I said the hat weighs nothing though. She said well put the hat on your head! I then boarded the plane and by the time the food arrived the air hostess said there was nothing left and I had to go without a decent lunch. Prior to boarding the plane there were four people near me who swore they would not fly with Jetstar again.

2014-11-03,3,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Business Class from Denpasar to Sydney was a total waste of money. My husband had a fixed metal box between his feet Seat 2G and had to sit at an angle to stretch his legs. The footrest was of no value whatsoever. The so called 'touch' screen required a hard tap to operate and I felt every selection the passenger behind me made. He also had long legs and therefore I couldn't recline my seat as far as I wanted. The flight departed at 10.30pm and was scheduled to take just over 5 hrs. The first hour of the flight was taken up with Business Class passengers eating their 'free' meal. The small window of opportunity to sleep was reduced. The toilet was Out of Order from the start of the flight. We fly Economy Jetstar regularly and have low expectations high satisfaction.

2014-10-28,8,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,We flew return from Melbourne to Tokyo on Jetstar. The flights were non stop so only 10 hours. Each flight left and arrived on time. The staff were efficient and friendly. We pre ordered vegetarian meals and they were excellent in fact some of the best airline food we have had. There is no inflight entertainment as advertised so we took our own iPads loaded with books and movies. We only had carry on luggage and although it complied with weight restrictions no one checked the size and weight. The seat pockets needed a good clean out as I found on both trips but the cabin and bathrooms were kept clean throughout the trip. The distance to the seat in front was a little squishy when the couple in front threw their seats back for the the return trip. This would be a problem if you are large. But I've had the problem on higher priced full serviced flights so it comes down to the courtesy of your fellow travellers. To date we have taken about 10 Jetstar flights and never a problem.

2014-10-28,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Melbourne to Honolulu - we chose to fly Jetstar as it is the only airline that flies to Honolulu direct from Melbourne. It markets itself as a low cost no frills airline. It was certainly no frills but definitely not low cost. We flew the week before September school holidays and the airfares were very expensive. Overall I would describe the experience as mediocre. We were in economy and walking through business class I would not pay the extra for what looked like a sub par business class offering. The seats were okay but what you would expect on a domestic flight not a long haul international flight. It was a night flight so people were wanting to try and sleep. In the row behind us were four off duty Qantas flight attendants who proceeded to drink to excess talk extremely loudly and swear constantly disturbing other passengers for at least four hours. The flight attendants on our flight took about 5 hours to finally tell them to quieten down. I was astounded that they thought it was okay to disturb other passengers for hours on end. Appalling behaviour that should have been pulled up sooner. Inflight entertainment is non existent on back of seats which is ridiculous. You can rent Ipads for $18 which were woeful. The limited range of movies seemed to be geared towards the male audience. Even the lifestyle section was a selection of cars and music shows. They really need to take a good look at this very limited and poor offering. We heard many fellow passengers complaining about the Ipad content also. Food was either pre booked and very expensive meals or snacks you could buy on board. Take your own food on board would be my advice. It would have been good to see more gluten free offerings rather than a cookie. Service was basic not particularly friendly and mostly absent.

As a normal Qantas traveller and having not travelled on Jetstar for 8 years I was pleasantly surprised of how good the service was. The flight itself was full and boarded late. Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas.

2014-10-22,,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,My family of three traveled from Manila to Sydney. We were delayed 2 days in Manila and were not informed when our flight will be until the last minute. They put us up in a very nice hotel in Manila while we were waiting. The morning of the flight they decided to take everyone to the airport at least 3 hours before the flight. I guess they were going for the Guinness book of records for the longest queue ever. Because they didn't start checking people in until all the bus loads had arrived. Little did I know this was a sign of what was to come. We had to change at Darwin to a connecting domestic flight where we arrived about 1pm. As our connecting flight was not there yet they put us up in a hotel in Darwin. We had to wait in a queue in Darwin 3 hours for our new tickets. That plus the 2.5 hours we had to wait in Manila plus an hour at the hotel. All this waiting in queues with a 12 month old infant. The flight from Darwin to Sydney left about 2am. A family we made friends with while waiting in the queue suffered worse than us. They were put off the plane at Darwin because their baby had eczema around it's mouth. Wasn't the whole family just the father and 3 kids. Mother was waiting for them in Sydney. The pilot said the family was removed because the child had an obvious illness. I witnessed the whole event and the pilot never left the cockpit. Anyone that has had a child with eczema would have known what it was. so anyway the family was taken off the plane and left on the bridge. One of the flight attendants coldly carried the sleeping girl and dumped her on the bridge. A memorably bad experience. If you have a family don't fly Jetstar.

2014-10-22,2,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,HNL-SYD and HBA-SYD return. First of all our flight from Hobart was delayed by nearly 2 hours. When we arrived in Sydney were told that no luggage had been loaded. It was very windy in Hobart so I get why this happened but we were off to Hawaii. Had we been given notice before checking in the luggage that this was a possibility we could have got our swimmers out and left the big bag in Hobart. Anyway Jetstar managed to give us about 3 different stories about when our luggage would arrive in Hawaii and each was completely contradictory. I spent perhaps 3 hours in the first couple of days trying to chase down what was going on. On the HNL SYD flight the attendants all seemed to be lovely but were absolutely hopeless. They were disorganised we didn't get a veg meal that we had ordered. The cabin was an absolute pigsty too - there was an overwhelming smell of urine there were coffee drips on my tray table milk spilt over the seat a carton of milk shoved down the side of the seat previous passengers' rubbish in the seatback compartment. I took my daughter to the toilet about 10 minutes after the seatbelt sign had been switched off and there was urine on the floor. We got back to SYD late and we missed our connecting flight. I had tried twice before leaving HNL to check in online it wouldn't let me. Tried again before going through customs wouldn't let me. I then called once we had got though customs talked to someone who told me she should be able to get it done. I asked her if she could let me know the quickest way to get to domestic and she said she could then put me on hold. Very long story short I ended up on the phone to her for 38 minutes got to check in 29 minutes before takeoff and was not allowed on the plane. I have travelled with Jetstar many times and at this stage the bad experiences outnumber the good about 3-1. Last time on a flight from HBA to MLB I organised (booked and paid for) transport via Jetstar and ended up at the airport with the company having no record of it and refusing to pick me up. The thing that I think frustrates me the most is that through all this it has been me who has had to chase everything up.

Last year I experienced a 4 hour delay in Melbourne on my return trip to Sydney which they blamed initially on mechanical trouble and a further plethora of excuses which I just tolerated at the time. Yesterday October 13th 2014 I copped another dose of Jetstars incompetence and attitude to its passengers. Supposed flying JQ413 at3pm to Sydney - arrived at 2pm. At 2.30pm an announcement made that the flight was cancelled (with no explanation) and that we were to be bussed 100km to Brisbane to join JQ817 to Sydney which didn't depart until 6.30pm. So instead of being home in Sydney at 5.30 pm we got there at 9.20 pm 4 hours late. Totally unacceptable.

The departure was fine nothing too major besides the language barrier. The return trip-was hell. I arrived at the airport and checked into the terminal at 1pm for a 2:30 flight. At 2 pm the notification was released that this flight and only this flight was to be postponed for 3 hours due to weather that was scheduled to arrive later that night. Why would you delay a flight so that it departs when weather turns bad vs while it's nice and sunny? I went to the ticket counter to enquire about being moved to the next available flight out and of course the next flights to my destination are on time and full. Great. So now my 2.30 departure is now a 5pm departure while all other airlines are on schedule. he attendant says I am more than welcome to book an earlier fight with a different carrier and will be refunded part of my trip - I was 'credited' 92USD not even close to half of the cost of the total trip but it was a refund. I proceed to a different carrier and walk away at the $430 one way option and sadly go back the original carrier after the prices were higher at each different carrier. I purchased the only flight to my destination for $115 - the only open and next available flight. I paid for the same seat twice. I have a seat on a plane that once again is delayed.

This is a LCC without free onboard service - but prices are low e.g. a hot meal (4 options) is 3 dollars inc. soft drink.

Most enjoyable flights that met my expectations. Only thing is the seats are nearly always so hard that my backside becomes numb. Thousands of pax sitting for hrs on these seats soon destroys much of their cushioning. I never buy onboard. Bring my own food and bottled water. Here in New Zealand we regularly travel CHC- AKL-CHC and only use Jetstar. Punctual good fares and we are always satisfied in every way.

2014-10-12,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary.

But then the whole planeload of passengers was left milling around trying to find out what was going to happen from a couple of harassed young Japanese Jetstar employees with limited English who were doing their level best in the face of increasingly bewildered and irritated passengers. After an hour or so news filtered through that there would be another flight late the following day. Eventually someone must have found the key to the room where the public address microphone is but no accommodation arranged or suggested and a couple of hundred people with all their bags simply left to their own devices in a deserted terminal in the middle of the night. Delays happen of course they do but you need a contingency plan for occasions such as these - and invest in a bullhorn for heavens sake so that you can keep people informed. When we eventually did get off the ground the service was fine and the food good.,,,,,,,,2.0,4.0,,2,no,4.0,3.0,
2014-10-12,,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Flew from Sydney-Melbourne-Bangkok and back. The staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. There was no consideration to the urgency to make adjoining flights. Landing back in Melbourne it took them 40 minutes to get our bags onto the turnstile because the 'machine was broken' so thus missed adjoining domestic connection.

Inflight entertainment was good but more variety would be appreciated particularly for children. It was a little frustrating that the cabin crew require photo ID for the inflight entertainment. Didn't have any photo ID besides my passport. A boarding pass sufficed but the flight attendant was not so happy I didn't have photo ID.

The seats in Row 1 are definitely the most comfortable with no one in front reclining and plenty of legroom. The lunch was delicious my wild mushroom arancini were as good as any I've tasted. I had a glass of Royal Chivers and the attendant made sure it was topped up necessitating an afternoon nana nap! A late afternoon snack of warm beef foccacia sandwich before getting into Tokyo was also excellent. Only gripe is the footrests are low and on the night return flight I would prefer the legs more elevated. However value for money one can't complain.

Firstly the Thai crew are excellent and are far superior to the domestic version in Australia. The aircraft was on time and was a comfortable flight from an engineering perspective. However the interior of this aircraft can only be described as a time capsule whereby the interior designer had a selection of interiors and said ""That's the one - the theme we will go for is recycled 1970's Estonian disco."" To be fair not all of the seats were broken mine reclined on the left side thereby putting my left shoulder on the lap of the person behind me while my right shoulder was touching the back of the seat in front of me. I especially liked the rips in the ""leather"" that allowed me to hang my mobile phone for viewing of videos. Very thoughtful. Also the 3 TV's that came with the plane at the front of interior did not work so we couldn't even follow a flight map. On the return leg same story re interior.

2014-09-17,,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,My wife and I booked business class Jetstar from Brisbane to Denpasar. Business is little better than economy with the seats in front dropping back into our laps - very little room. Worse was the return flight which Jetstar cancelled a few hours before departure. The email told us to phone an Australian customer service number (our cost) and we were told we had been moved to business on Virgin the following afternoon. When we checked in at Virgin we were told Jetstar had downgraded us to economy. After much argument with the Jetstar representative at the airport where the only options offered were to fly to Perth or Sydney they magically found two business class seats on that night's flight direct to Brisbane. We had to sit around at the airport for 10 hours. This was the first and last time I will fly Jetstar. My advice to fellow travellers is never fly Jetstar.

Jetstar cancelled the flight 27 August and without consultation re-booked us to travel 29 August. After requesting what other options were available a flight on 26 August was offered. Since we had accommodation sightseeing and a cruise confirmed 29 and 26 August were not acceptable to us. Knowing that Jetstar operated out of the Gold Coast I requested that we be transferred to fly OOL-NRT 29 August. The inflight crew on the outbound flight were mostly foreign and very professional and friendly. Food service was OK. On the return flight the food was inedible. The aircraft operating this service is the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The only dream we had was to be able to get out of our seats. Once the seats in front were reclined it was impossible to get out. The recline came back to the level of the armrest preventing one to stand up. The only way to exit the seat is to swing ones legs over the armrest into the aisle.

When my husband had to go to the bathroom he had to ask the man in front of me to push his seat back up so he could get past !

Typical Jetstar lack of truth in advertising and false information provided at booking. With two weeks notice this was not maintenance related but rather it was planned. No refund offered despite the B787 being the only reason I booked. The flight itself was typical Jetstar. $46 for my checked bag $20 for an 'up front' seat $59 for the 'plus' package etc. Nickeled and dimed to death.

At Narita Airport the staff were friendly I would expect nothing less in Japan. Australia is where the drop in service is found. The first few flights were fine. Staff seemed a bit unfriendly. Melbourne was a whole other story. Ticket counter staff: The staff were chatting with each other and did not notice me standing in the economy line. The girl took my passport without a greeting and continued talking to her co-worker. In a condescending tone said ""You know this flight is 2 hours late right?"" Never an apology for the inconvenience. I was given my ticket with no explanation about where the gates were or how to handle this delay. I decided to wait at the gate and get information there. The 11pm flight now said 1.30 departure with ""Closed"" next to it. I had no idea what this meant and other customers seemed confused as well. My ticket said 12.30 boarding in pen so I just waited. At 12.45 a gate staff member came to the gate but made no announcements. At 12.50 we find out they will start boarding at 110 once the plane has been deplaned. Boarding: The female gate attendant at least said thank you to each customer the male said nothing. Just scanned all of the boarding passes like a robot. I was surprised they never checked our passports even though it was an international flight. Flight: The flight had about 100 people. The airplane could probably hold about 340 people. Still all the customers were assigned seats right next to each other. The flight crew announced that ""You may notice how empty the flight is. Please wait until we are in the air to choose new seats."" Once we were on the plane the pilot needed to get the weights and the flight crew needed to remember where meal customers were seated so they prohibited seat changing. Very poor customer service by airport staff! Flight: The seats were actually very comfortable. My intention was to sleep through the flight. Unfortunately my ticket said meal on it unbeknownst to me so 2 hours into my sleep the flight attendant jabbed my arm to wake me up and give me the food. Her exact words? ""You ordered the meal."" As we were landing the flight crew (not the pilot) made an announcement to thank us for flying and finally apologized for the delayed time. All in all - not the best experience. The food was good. The IPAD rental is ridiculously expensive and from what I heard doesn't offer a lot of selection. The flight attendants seems rushed or irritated when they did their jobs.

I got to the airport about three hours in advance when ground staff said one can check in only two hours prior. An hour passed and when I approached them again to find out the flight had been delayed until the following morning at 4.40am and passengers would be able to collect a meal voucher worth SD$8.00 and that was it. We could not check in until 6pm. The least Jetstar can offer is some bottled water and increase the meal voucher which is less than Aus$10. To hang around with luggage for so many hours at terminal 1 is not fun at all and an inconvenience.

Cruising: Drink served and soon the meal which was pretty good appeared. Cheese and wafers and fruit and a glass of lovely Rutherglen muscadelle were great. Inflight service: Once ""service"" is over staff become very scarce and those who are about do not overtly seek eye contact. However a walk into the galley is greeted warmly and efficiently for any small request. Inflight crew: The captain and second were good on announcements and I look forward to having them up front again. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous but you felt that was the extent of the service offering. I was sitting next to an off duty staff member and was not greeted with a hello or any form of inquiry as to my flight for the duration of the flight. I suppose that is what separates the great airlines from the good airlines? If you love your product or just go to work is demonstrated by behaviours not platitudes of company jingles. Overall: Great plane and cabin and faultless service for most part.

The only drawback with Jetstar is the add-ons when you purchase your ticket. Add on baggage. Add on insurance. Add on donation. Add on seating allocation. Add on forward seats. Add on extra leg room. Add on carbon offset. And the worst is the booking fee they slug you with at the end which can be up to or more than $34. Ouch! Overall I would recommend Jetstar on the basis of good service for short haul flights. Just watch out for those extras.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,,3,yes,0.0,1.0,
2014-07-12,9,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Sydney-Darwin red eye flight. Paid for exit row seats which were worth it for the extra leg room.

2014-07-10,7,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Sydney to Honolulu in business class on A330. Check in was quick and efficient although disappointed no priority baggage for business. We didn't take the upsell option with Qantas lounge access as gold Qantas FF so had access in any case. Product is closer to premium economy as is price and evaluation should consider this as noted many otter compare to full service airlines business products. The seat was ok comfortable but any overnight flight will always be hard. Perhaps better quality pillow and blankets would help. Food was good soy glazed chicken with noodles and vegetables. Chicken very tender and noodles more tasty than they looked. Vegetables were overlooked. Standout was cherry tomato and basil soup. What I liked was they took food and drink order before take off so getting drink after seatbelt sign off pretty quick. Crew very friendly especially cabin manager. Nice wine selection. Price difference between Jetstar and Qantas whose business product on 767 for route closer to domestic mean Jetstar very good option. IFE options poor bring own iPad.,,,,,,,,3.0,5.0,,4,yes,4.0,2.0,

2014-07-06,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,JQ 29 MEL-BKK on B787. First trip on the 'Dreamliner' which might as well be named 'Nightmareliner'. I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner. Wouldn't go out of my way to fly either Jetstar or their B787.,,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,1.0,,2,no,1.0,1.0,
2014-07-06,9,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,I flew from Sydney to Townsville yesterday with my husband. When we arrived at Sydney Airport we were a bit discouraged to see an extremely long queue at the Jetstar check in counter but to our surprise the queue moved very quickly and we were in line for less than 15 minutes. We checked in with no dramas and we boarded and flew out exactly on time. Once seated however I discovered that a mother and two young children aged around 4 and 6 years were seated behind me and the youngest child started to kick the back of my seat pull the tray up and down and make a fair amount of noise bickering with the other child. I put up with it until after takeoff before getting the attention of a flight attendant. I explained the situation to her quietly so as not to offend anyone and we were moved to a seat at the back of the plane immediately no questions asked. I can appreciate that it is difficult for children to sit still when flying but I was not looking forward to having my seat kicked for 2.5 hours and I was grateful that flight staff on Jetstar were able to move us quickly and without fuss. The entire flight went smoothly after that and the flight crew were very friendly and attentive throughout. I believe that we got excellent value for money for our flight and I was more than happy with the service provided.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,5.0,,4,yes,4.0,4.0,
2014-06-25,9,Singapore,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Singapore to Ho Chi Minh return A320. Group check in was fairly quick. Short flight so no IFE and no food was not a problem.

2014-06-16,7,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,12 June 2014. JQ 30 BKK-MEL. Business seat 1 F Boeing 787-8. First flight on a 787 and booked my normal 1F. At check in advised it was one 1 E. Due to language difficulties I could not understand why and my request for an explanation was polite but I was not able to master the meaning. I was informed it was a window seat so proceeded to the aircraft. I was then advised that I was in the second row. The reason I fly in row one is for the legroom and lack of a seat in my face for 9 hours making laptop use at times impossible. Again the explanation was difficult to understand and upon my insistence I eventually got back into 1F. It appears the IFE was U/S in seat 1F and the crew were trying to assist me. Lived without IFE. Food and service very good from an all Thai crew which is becoming the norm on this leg and JQ 29. Big drawback with the 787 in seat 1F is that the galley access is out of alignment with the seat so approximately one foot of the space in front of the seat is in line with the open galley. This means when the crew make their multiple visits the curtain hits the passengers legs. This could be some what alleviated with a retainer lower down the curtain. So for 787 flights I advise I will be sitting in 1B or 1J which are out of the way of the traffic flow by about 4 inches. The seats were reasonably comfortable with reasonable recline but footrests need improving as the rung like support is intrusive. Plane new and clean as you would expect. PA from flight deck was nearly indecipherable. This is a safety issue that needs attending to. The headset issued now has a 3 pin plug and subjectively the headsets don't seem as noise cancelling as the ones on the A330. A pity my Bose were in checked luggage as the 3 pin plug would not worth the headset with my phone or Ipad so no IFE and no music. Not the end of the world but an opportunity for better communication with customers one would have thought.,,,Business Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,,4,yes,4.0,1.0,

Despite showing the loading attendant our confirmation for the passenger she showed absolutely no concern and would not make any further enquires. The result was that we had to fly on leaving our friend to sort things out in Sydney. This he did and it was found to be a Jetstar error. The rudeness and total unhelpfulness of the person in charge of the boarding gate shows just why this airline continues to rank amongst the top of the list of unpopular airlines.

Ready for take off pushed backed then stopped captain said it would only be ten minutes turned out to be almost two hours sitting on the plane before take off. Return flight one hour late in taking off. Thank goodness they changed the aircraft from the 787 to the airbus (more room).

I paid extra to fly out of DPS at 12.30p.m. and now have been rescheduled to the 10.30p.m. flight which on booking was much cheaper. I will never book with Jetstar again.

2014-05-26,,United States,,Jetstar Airways customer review,What a terrible excuse for an airline. My daughter was in Australia for 4 months in a study abroad program and as we live in Hawaii I made the mistake of booking Jetstar to Honolulu as it was the only nonstop from Sydney. I purchased their max. checked baggage allowance of 40Kg (wouldn't let me buy more) although I thought she might be slightly over since basically every other airline allows two fifty lb bags to be checked they cap it at two 44 lb bags. She was 4 kg total over at check in and they told her she would need to pay $25 per kg. I told her to start dumping things in front of the check in desk. She was on a half full flight and 4kg was going to matter? They also weigh purses as part of this luggage scam because you are only allowed 10kg carried on.

2014-05-17,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Ballina-Melbourne on A320. Paid about $100 or so for a one way ticket which I purchased on Qantas website . Baggage allowance was 20kg and there was no detail on the QF website about incremental charges for excess baggage. Travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg - ie: 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. Jetstar charged me $300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. Qantas should be reprimanded for selling Jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and Jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesn't remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. Qantas customer service people in Melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a Jetstar issue (even though JQ is owned by QF and the ticket was bought on the QF website). Jetstar employees in Melbourne were unsympathetic said I should've known read the policies etc. One even suggested they should be charging more and didn't think $500-1000 was out of line.

One change even involved me having to swap a direct flight for one with a layover in Bali with 1 day's notice. This flight was again changed on the evening before the flight. On arrival in Singapore for a connecting flight to Bali I discovered my luggage had been completely destroyed due to a heavy oil leak (not from within my bag) and having been crushed by other heavy luggage.

2014-05-08,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,My wife 3 children and I flew from Honolulu to Melbourne just under an 11 hour flight. No mention of needing to pre-book ipads. The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers? Apparently not.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,,3,no,1.0,1.0,

Luckily we had our original online bookings done via Qantas docs printed with us. Our friends on the earlier flight during the week were made to re-check their luggage in Singapore but we were not also another level of inconsistency. Fly Silk is my advice until they have got their act together or fail which may not be far off looking at the way they seem to be going.

I flew on 2 May from Perth to Bangkok. The trouble was I took an aspirin 10 minutes after takeoff and asked for a water. I was told it cost $4 cash. All I had was my ATM card. Four dollars: for a bottle of water on a 5 hour flight. Then I noticed I was sitting on a stripped Airbus that could easily pass for a re-purposed 1971 Trailways bus. No video entertainment zero amenities - 5 hours with nothing to do. I am sure Jetstar would install pay toilets if they could. Flying Jetstar left me with a renewed appreciation for Thai Airways and KAL.

2014-04-29,2,China,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Jetstar Airways isn't a budget carrier in terms of the price they charge. It cost my group members over $800 each to fly from Singapore to Hangzhou when tickets on full-fledge flights with meals refreshments and entertainment on other airlines like SIA and Cathay Pacific can cost less. It's 'budget' quality in seats with very narrow leg space so the flight attendants insisted that all hand carry had to be stored in the overhead compartments. Problem is that all the compartments near our seats were full with the crew's and other passengers luggage. There didn't seem to be restrictions on the size and the number of hand-carry passengers could bring on the plane. A crew member offered to squeeze my backpack into a compartment that was far from my seat. As I had my passport and money in it it refused to have it out of my sight. I had a most uncomfortable trip with the bag in front of me and hardly any room to stretch my legs.

Seat 1F - which was in a row of 3 when I checked in on-line the seats next to me were free but at check-in they agent advised these seats were now taken. I had asked if I could move to 3G/H but was told these were reserved for crew! I had read online that these were the best seats with more recline what's the point of having them if they are only for crew - seems pointless! Seat config of 2-3-2. For business class I don't understand the point of a row of 3 seats. Seat comfort was ok but impossible to sleep in. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Dinner was ok - Soup for starter which was tasteless Main was very tasty which was stir fry steak. Was accompanied with a 'salad' which was a couple of lettuce leaves in a bowl. Wine choice good. Entertainment system ok - had a couple of new release movies and some recent TV shows but quite limited. Overall it was good value for money but I'd hardly call this Business Class. I don't see why Jetstar wouldn't invest in putting in slightly bigger seats with more recline especially when the majority of their flights on the way back to Australia are red eye and the current seats are impossible to sleep in comfortably.,,,Business Class,,,,,2.0,5.0,,4,yes,3.0,3.0,

All aircraft's were clean and cabin crew were fine. Several times I had emergency exit seats offered which I accepted and have no complaint with my treatment. I don't usually purchase food as I am sure I can survive for 2.5 hrs. The fares were all cheap easy to book and are good value. As always you get what you pay for. I rarely take luggage so the fare structure suits me and I always pay via Direct Debit to save on Credit Card Fees.

Very dirty and grubby plane esp for such a new aircraft (the carpet was appalling). Had flown Jetstar J before and knew what to expect but the seat seemed less comfy but maybe it was my imagination. Service wasn't an issue for us as the flight is only 3 hrs but I have to say that if was crammed into a Y seat for 9 hrs to Asia I would understand how the convicts must have felt coming out to Australia. All in all had low expectations which were met. Did like the 787 as an aircraft and look fwd to seeing them on QF services one day in the future.,,,,,,,,2.0,3.0,,3,no,3.0,2.0,

2014-03-17,3,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"MEL-HNL-MEL purchased an upgrade to the business class product on outbound. Did not expect anything like business class product on other international carriers so I was not disappointed with the product overall: it is closer to a premium economy product. Food was pretty good wines were fine very limited options on the free iPad but the noise-reducing headphones were great and no complaints about the amenities packet. However the leg room and recline were quite limited and the leg rest on my seat did not work. Chief FA looked at it and pronounced the cable broken ""like lots of these seats"" offered no regrets but pointed to 2 company non-revs in the bulkhead row and asked if I wanted her to go and roust them out so I could sit there. I felt very much put on the spot and declined. Miserable night. I suppose I should have been more assertive. On the inbound: execrable vegetarian food in economy and the seats also busted: no reading light no call bell no expression of regret from cabin staff (and this was an exit row seat for which I had paid extra). A332 on both flights very dirty and shabby. The toilets on both were simply disgusting even at the start of each flight. Many FAs wore dirty or tattered uniforms with buttons missing and frayed hems and cuffs. Of course the ticket was relatively cheap and Jetstar is now the only non-stop between MEL and HNL so one has to hold one's nose and endure.

Leaving Melbourne we were aware of this and took our own sandwiches and bottled water purchased in the Duty Free area at Tullamarine - no problem. On both return journeys - at Bangkok airport - our bags were searched before boarding and all water was confiscated from passengers. Although we could purchase drinks and snacks using a credit card on-board we did not. Surely Jetstar could at least provide free bottled water to dehydrated passengers.

The lady in front of me tried to recline her seat during the flight but could not because my knee was jammed up against the back of her seat.

For example: I was flying 3K764 KIX-MNL and they offer online check in. But when you get to the airport the special line for online checked in passengers is closed and you have to queue with the regular passengers. The local Jetstar staff doesn't seem to understand the concept of on-line check in and frequent travelers would agree with me that it's quite annoying.

Massive queues at Sydney but moving quickly due to the fully manned bag drops. However in Melbourne for the return two ""jobsworths"" asked where passengers were travelling to and only allowed certain flights to join the queue. Consequently when they did finally condescend to allow us in it was an almighty scramble to get the bag dropped and to the gate before the flight. Really let the airline sown.

We had carry on only and we used web check in so we could go straight to the gate no queuing or anything. Flight was on time and aircraft was clean. Seat was adequately comfortable however the legroom was limited it would be a bit uncomfortable on a longer flight. Crew were especially good on this flight very welcoming and helpful. Didn't purchase any food onboard or entertainment onboard - no need to spend the extra $$ on a short flight. Arrived early. JQ793 - 18th Jan 2014. Aircraft A320 VH-VQQ. Seat: 28F. Flight was good seat pretty comfortable more legroom on this older and differently configured aircraft. Once again didn't purchase any food or entertainment. Crew were helpful. Arrived on time.

Check in manager very rude even after I produced my ASIC and advised her that I was fully aware of the conditions of being in an exit row. Inexcusable behaviour. Flight was out on time on a new A320 but I cannot understand the cabin crew. A person should not do a job like this if they are not cut out to do it. Sure the flight was a ""red eye"" and as a frequent flyer I can accept that this can affect your moods. But the fact that one staff member (Cabin Manager) was putting meals on the floor another male member of staff (who conveniently wore no name tag) was slamming around and making as much noise as he possibly could. He was on a mission not to let passengers sleep. And then the lot of them standing there and complaining about their jobs - well you get the picture.

To be fair the flight was a lot cheaper than any of the other full service airlines but you get what you pay for. Flew back to Tokyo on Air NZ a few weeks later and was amazed at the difference. Chalk and cheese. Seats are uncomfortable and have minimum legroom (even on a large aircraft such as the A330). Cabin crew are rude (and their polyester polo shirt uniforms are awful).

2014-01-16,8,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,I have traveled with Jetstar from Perth to Bali and return twice in the last 2 years. Both times were on an Airbus A320. Personally I found the seats in economy class quite OK compared to the economy seats on Qantas and Virgin who use Boeing 737's. Being a low cost carrier I made sure I read the fine print and terms and conditions. Once again as is so true in life you get what you pay for. Budget Airline means no frills and the bare basics unless you want to pay extra. As it is only a 3.5 hour flight I was more than happy to forgo the full services offered in exchange for a much cheaper fare. Both times Jetstar have provided a realistic service for the price paid. Aircraft was clean flight on time and fairly smooth. No real complaints. What I expected was met and I would much rather have the money I saved to spend on my holiday than enjoying all the perks of a full service carrier.

Though the return flight from Osaka was average. They forgot my sons meal during dinner service (I had to ask them for it) they did apologise though he ordered chicken and got beef and I said nothing as I figured it was all to much trouble for them. Then the girl going through the cabin offering desert tea and coffee missed us completely. Once again I had to ask. The fight from Cairns started good with a very helpful girl at the counter. Some of the crew were terrible. Then a rather rude women on the crew ordering people to sit down marching up and down the plane and the two crew members sitting down the back during the whole trip gossiping in loud voices. As an Australian it was embarrassing. As a regular flyer I've got to say the service is pretty average and it really is hit or miss. Some staff members are very good while some are woeful.

They appear to be over-anticipating passenger demand on some routes and when supply outstrips demand simply cancelling flights and disrupting passengers by either flying them the next day or transferring them to flights to other airports on sister airlines and bussing passengers to their original destination.

No empathy no consideration blunt and rude. Whilst it is ridiculous that you have to weigh both your suitcase and handbag the exorbitant fee and accompanying rude treatment is even worse.

Due to putting bags on first in CNS we were the last to receive our bags in TYO which is not like business class on other aircraft's. (You shouldn't’have to wait 45mins for your bags if you are paying a higher price for seats). Economy class on the return was good. The flight was not full so everyone was spaced out.

Travelling on the Qantas group these days is death by a thousand cuts - you never know what service will be cut next - but surely no stairs to disembark the aircraft is taking it a bit far!,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,,3,no,0.0,0.0,

2013-10-23,,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,I have used Jetstar 3 times in the past two weeks coming and going Sydney to Melbourne and every time they have had delays ranging from 15 minutes to an hour. Tonight my flight Melbourne to Sydney was delayed by an hour and the boarding gate area at Melbourne airport was chaotic hot (no aircon) smelly and didn't have enough seats for passengers so people were sitting on the ground. Reminded me of Bombay airport in the early 80's. More often than not you hear of overbooked passengers from Qantas being transferred to a Jetstar flight but you are never offered a seat on a Qantas flight if you booked through Jetstar and there is a delay. I keep being seduced by the cheaper ticket but really it's just not worth the stress of always running late or having to wait for extended periods in D grade boarding gates.

2013-10-20,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"Hobart to Melbourne JQ714. Supposed to travel 17 October at 2240. Booked our seats about 10 days before travel ($10 fee) and got a printout. Made the mistake of not checking in when we arrived thinking the seat booking was sufficient. So after waiting 2.5 hours to board we discovered that we did need boarding cards. The supervisor then told us it was too late numbers/names had gone to the Captain and there was nothing he could do - catch the next flight in the morning. Where do we stay? Shrug. Sent us to the Jetstar desk to register for the flight and we were told we had to pay $150 late booking fee! Asked the supervisor if he could waive the fee as we had no choice but to book late. ""No can't do that."" Airport closing soon - see you later. No attempt to help or suggest any > accommodation or anything. Found some nice people who helped us find a hotel close by - $189: not much sleep. My question is: why if we've booked and the supervisor goes through the list to make up a manifest can they not make an announcement to check if people who've booked and paid for seats are in the transit lounge? Apparently with online booking this mistake does happen from time to time. Secondly why is it so hard to just call up the Captain and request the addition of 2 more passengers - who already have booked seats? It's called 'Customer Care'.

Ground staff at MEL airport were polite and assisted with checking our two bags (under my name) onto the flight. The flight attendants boarding the flight at the gate were extremely rude yelling at passengers to move forward in the long queue. Once onboard the service was better and the crew were quite friendly at times offering to retrieve bags from the overhead compartment. One of my bags didn't arrive in Brisbane - which is curious because it was checked in at the same time as the other bag. I was told that it didn't make it onto the flight and that they would only be able to send it by courier the next day.

On my return flight there was no identification of the flight number or time at the gate gate changes over the speaker that were incorrect nor any staff there to help with any queries. Both flights were extremely delayed and the flight crew were not helpful. Bags were moved by the flight crew and they did not inform the passengers. It took over 35 minutes to board the plane. The most annoying part about the whole thing was that the lines to board were crazy - we were told to line up once we were all lined up and waiting in line they decided to change the way in which to board to seat 19-37 first. On both my flights the flight hostesses were rude very unhelpful and kept hitting the back of my seat without apologising. I would never fly Jetstar again it was an awful experience.

In our experience Jetstar is not as good as it used to be. Attitudes of airline staff are pretty dodgy with only one air steward on our recent flight seeming at all interested in passengers. It is a budget airline but the cleanliness of the cabin should not be compromised. Chewing gum was stuck to the seat in front of me windows were covered in finger prints which indicated a child had sat in the seat on the previous flight and the toilets at the front of the plane were not clean to begin with so were quite revolting by the end of the 6hr flight. To top it off the young couple in the seats directly in front of us reclined their seats as far back as possible so neither my hubby nor I could move his knees were literally squished into the back of the seat. When we asked the air steward to request they pop their seats forward slightly so we could at least move our legs the response was very cool but they eventually acquiesced.

The flight was a good example of what a LCC should be. On time departure and arrival friendly crew a clean A320 and surprisingly comfortable seats. I am 180cm and my knees were not touching the seat in front perhaps due to the clever re-positioning of the magazine pocket to the top of the seat-back above the meal tray.

In the end the overall cost went up by approx $185 thus cancelling out vouchers. Probably would not have travelled with them as they worked out to be not much cheaper than other airlines after the 'voucher' debacle.

Eventually made it to the downstairs departure lounge and queued at the allocated gate only to find at the last minute that the gate had changed with no announcement which left about 50 passengers scrambling through the terminal to catch the flight. With the doors shut plane then sat at the departure gate for 25 minutes with no advice or announcements about the reason for the delay and how it would effect our arrival time. When the flight finally departed about a third of the in flight snack menu was unavailable and the attendants were unable to accept foreign currency despite us receiving an unsolicited email from Jetstar 2 days earlier explaining that foreign currencies were accepted on this flight.

All boarding and cabin staff were efficient friendly and cheerful. As you expect on a budget airline the seating is cramped but its no real problem on such a short flight. Overall no issues with the flight or service. The biggest problem is the shambolic departure area in the downstairs Qantas/Jetstar terminal in Melbourne.

Entertainment was on ipads and more than adequate for a 7-1/2 hour flight. The seat was adequate with sufficient leg room but was by no means what one would expect from a quality airline.

Upon arrival At Perth no gates at the terminal were available so our aircraft parked in the middle of the tarmac and we were bussed to the terminal when we landed the buses were busy and we had to wait 40 minutes in Perth for a bus from the plane to the terminal.

2013-02-25,7,Vietnam,,Jetstar Airways customer review,It's a quick trip between these 2 cities but passengers spend longer at the airports than on the plane. Bag drop at Melbourne was a slow process. About 50 people in line and only 4 of the 12 desks operating. When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient. Despite the aircraft being on the ground for a good 35 minutes most of the windows were grubby. The flight was fine and I had about 2cm between my knees and the seat in front. Thankfully they didn't recline the seat. A 15 minute delay in Sydney waiting for a clear air-bridge and a 20 minute wait to collect our bags capped off an uneventful flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,,3,yes,3.0,0.0,

Ground staff treated us more like cattle than passengers if it wasn't for my ability to run with the crowd I would have been trampled whilst boarding as there was no line or structure to this process.

For a flight of only 6.5 hours the crew took 2 hours 45 mins to serve drinks/dinner and 1.5 hours to serve breakfast. Bear in mind that this is a low cost airline and meals etc are only provided to those who are prepared to pay at the time of serving. I took a good look at the number of passengers who did purchase meals and there were not many therefore the serving times should have been a lot faster than they were. In between serving the crew made no attempt to contain their noise coming from the galley. Probably the most disruptive flight I have been on and for a change it was not the passengers who were the cause. Perhaps a review of the serving processes is required to help speed this up.

Got to the airport and explained what had happened and was told straight that they didn't care and to fly another airline if I didn't like it. They then charged me $160 for 6kg of luggage. It didn't get any better once on board. The leg room was non existent and my knees where against the back of the seat in front for the 3.5 hour flight.

2013-01-15,8,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,MEL-SIN return. We chose not to pay extra for mileage credits. We sought legroom and we got it. The seat width was suitable. We needed a wheelchair and ‘pusher’ at all travel terminal areas as they had slopes difficult joining lips & pushing distances beyond what I am capable of doing. Jetstar assisted with a wheelchair on the outward leg. Only after much discussion did we get 'pusher' assistance on arrival in Singapore. When this came it was an excellent 'local service' - a gratuity was not begrudged. For frequent travellers being a continuing Qantas Club member as I am was wise. In Singapore they arranged the 'pusher' service to our return gate. Sadly at both check-ins knowledge by Jetstar staff about Business Class Max rights plus those of Qantas Club Members was either nil or misinformed. It was a bad start later righted by Qantas Club Staff at both lounges. The in light food choices were acceptable. No problems with the complimentary liquor nor level of service table decor or travel amenities supplied. Seat back lowering by the person in front was a concern on both flights as we had to disturb those persons when we wished to move about. Our outward seats were in Row 6 – the last in Business Class with restricted but acceptable lowering for a day flight not suitable if overnight. The Jetstar web-site would not let me pre-select a seat if you had asked for ‘wheelchair assistance’ as we had - it was one or the other and this is unsatisfactory. On return I opted to select Row 4 to fully recline. In this position the seat is not a fully reclining ‘sleeper’- footrest space is insufficient. With a 2-3-2 configuration in this cabin I would not choose the middle seat of a fully occupied ‘3’. We were fortunate both ways in not having a full cabin thus no problem with overhead storage but a number of the compartments were taken up with staff bags and service items-not good. Ours were Jetstar stop-over flights in Singapore as part of flying to/from China thus and correctly there were helpful Chinese & English speaking flight attendants however the level of English could have been better. In reading some of the adverse comments about Jetstar Business the benefits provided compared to cost is being ignored. It is a precious approach to compare Jetstar to a 'full service' airline. I would fly Jetstar Business/Star Class again.,,,,,,,,4.0,5.0,,4,yes,5.0,3.0,

True legroom is tight and when the seat in front of you is reclined you cannot get out without disturbing your neighbors. A lovely amenity kit provided.

I had a middle seat in middle aisle so really the worst seat in business class however it was comfortable and I was able to sleep.

No food is provided unless you pay for it. In fact you're best to pre-book because the food runs out. Back to Melbourne. Jetstar offered us an alternative flight on Qantas. We wanted to go home early to save us hanging around the airport for hours. We were offered one flight which left later than the one they cancelled. No effort to be conciliatory. Given the fault was theirs they should have made at least some effort to be more helpful. We couldn't check in our luggage because the paperwork wasn't done.

I picked up the larger of our 2 bags that were on the floor side-by-side and halfway there she said not that one the other one. It was a standard luggage bag that she would have known was in regulation size and visually you could see it was the smaller of the two.

2012-11-23,9,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,We travelled from Melbourne to Singapore yesterday. Purchased flights approx 5 months ago on a special. We had seats 1 J and K which are bulk head seats. We have travelled business class with Emirates and were never under the assumption that we were going to get the same level with Jetstar. Some fellow passengers were disappointed with the service but they had much higher expectations.

IFE was the only let down. Very limited range of movies and even though we flew over in Oct and back in Nov we had Nov choices both ways so 20 hrs with only 2 movies I wanted to see out of the limited selection. We didn't buy food but took our own on the plane and this was no problem. Checking in baggage is not inexpensive but if you do it at time of booking it is not too bad.

Flight to Narita was 9.5 hrs from Gold Coast and add around 1.5 hrs from Sydney to Gold Coast but still being a very large plane and only around 50 or so people on board you can take advantage of the 4 seaters. I have learnt that you don't have to book seats on these flights and pay an extra $25 for it better to use that money to add check baggage to your flight and checked baggage isn't really cheap at $45 for 15kg.

2012-11-13,3,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,We flew Business Max class from Melbourne to Singapore and although Jetstar promises that they offer all of the normal business class service they neglect to mention that the seats are only marginally larger than economy and hardly recline at all! There is so little room between the rows that when the passenger in front has his seat reclined it is almost impossible to leave your seat! On a short daytime flight perhaps but on an overnight flight sleep is impossible. The food was however quite good and the alcohol service OK but nothing makes up for uncomfortable seating or the lack of pillows (unbelievable even though they provide a blow-up neck support). They also don't offer the normal express service through immigration etc and no priority baggage handling which is quite annoying. So in summary - a definite improvement on economy seating but by no means the normal business class that they promise but then again you get what you pay for!,,,,,,,,1.0,4.0,,3,no,3.0,4.0,

Food was surprisingly good better than domestic business and international premium economy on QF but not international business standard. Beverage selection excellent. You can choose from the entire for sale menu from the economy cabin at any time which gives you access to a much wider selection of mid flight snacks than could be offered on a full service airline.

2012-10-11,8,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,My partner and I fly with Jetstar regularly choosing them over Qantas because economy seats are more comfortable and the crew generally more friendly attentive and genuine. We are Qantas Club members (corporate) and only have one real complaint about Jetstar. We are able to access the Qantas Club lounge but cannot use the Qantas Club check in facilities. The queues at Melbourne and Sydney terminal 2 are notoriously long and while we all stand there waiting with people stressing and Jetstar staff running up and down the line calling passengers to counters for 'called flights' the adjacent Qantas check in counters (especially the dedicated Qantas Club ones) are empty with staff having lovely personal chats. Why doesn't Qantas Group either use these under utilised counters and check Qantas Club members in or create a dedicated Jetstar queue for these premium passengers instead of constantly annoying us by making us wait for ages. Surely it wouldn't cost too much to implement and would be a fantastic customer service to an already pretty good airline. Just because it's a 'low cost' doesn't mean premium passengers should be treated in a low cost fashion. Also I thought 'leisure airline' was the preferred term for Jetstar - perception is very powerful. Tiger is 'low cost'.,,,Economy Class,,,,,5.0,5.0,,4,yes,4.0,4.0,

Chatty FA on OOL-KIX gave us lots of tips for our first trip to Osaka/Kyoto. iPad rental a bit disappointing as content not very extensive. Meals very basic but were included in a prepaid bundle. The 2-4-2 configuration on the A330 is good for couples travelling. Paid $10 for entry to the Gold Coast lounge very basic (soon to be taken over by QF). Used QF lounge in NRT as a QF Gold cardholder good but very busy. Overall a fantastic trip especially bearing in mind QF or JL SYD-NRT were over $1200 per person.

Went through customs told the flight information on our boarding passes was wrong - incorrect flight number! The board had a gate but no time! We went to the gate and found other people some of whom had received text messages saying that the flight was delayed until 14.45 or 4.45. After what would have been boarding time some Jetstar staff eventually appeared. First we were greeted with - didn't you hear the announcement! Then we were given - reluctantly - $10 vouchers to keep us fed and watered for the next 5.5 hours. Had we been told this at check-in we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. Jetstar don't allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. When we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldn't be delayed! Then they delayed us as they tried to find 15 missing people - probably the ones who had been told 4.45 instead of 14.45. Never again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,1.0,,2,no,2.0,3.0,

In order to avoid a fuss my mother agreed to move to the middle seat. However as soon as the meal service ended the passenger who demanded my aisle seat fully reclined the two seats in front of my mother so his 3yr old and 6 yr old daughters could relax. Because the armrests on the StarClass seats are fixed in position mum was trapped in her seat until the next meal service 7 hours later! To be fair the aircrew were great and handled this unpleasant situation very well. I do not understand how an airline can advertise that you can pay for seat allocation and then not honour the terms of their contract. Let alone humiliating myself and making my mother very uncomfortable during the flight.

Then an hour later they reschedule to 7 pm departure! Midnight at the hotel and a days leave wasted and I have not left home yet!,,,Economy Class,,,,,0.0,1.0,,1,no,0.0,0.0,
2012-07-13,8,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"I flew PER-MEL on 1st July. The flight boarded well ahead of the departure time but sat at the gate for 45 minutes probably because the Qantas systems were down that day and Qantas passengers were being shuffled onto our flight. We made up time and arrived early. Cabin crew were led by a Staff Development Manager so were on best behaviour. A reviewer below mentioned that all other Australian airlines have 30-33"" seat pitch - I'm not sure this is quite true (Tiger run the same aircraft type with the same number of seats and some Virgin seating is very tight these days) but some seats are definitely better than others. What I don't understand is why they only run A320's to Perth - these are the longest domestic flights and according to the website their A321s and A330s have more generous seat pitch.",,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,,4,yes,3.0,0.0,

2012-07-05,2,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Myself and partner flew Sydney to Cairns return. From the international terminals we could purchase sandwiches and muffins on the forward trip but they only had Mars bars or crisps on the return trip at 7am in the morning. Pretty ordinary for a 3 hour flight. The seat in economy on the A330 are very tight my knees were on the seat in front flight attendants never smile.

2012-07-04,4,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,MEL-HNL via SYD. Jetstar insist that their own international passengers claim their bags at Sydney domestic and then carry them across to International although they will check bags through for American Airlines passengers! In fact nowhere on the ticket is it mentioned that passengers have to make their own way from the domestic terminal in Sydney to the international - either a bus or a train fare away. The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid. I would suggest that elderly passengers in particular stay away from Jetstar International if their flight involves a domestic connection because Jetstar will require them to claim their own luggage and check in again at the connection point.,,,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,3.0,,3,no,3.0,0.0,
2012-07-03,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,JQ038 to Bali and Back. The seats were awful. They are so tight once the person in front reclines you have to recline your seat. We paid for all the extras the food was very limited so we had to buy food anyway they forgot our comfort pack and in fact we found later into the flight they gave it to someone else who hadn't paid for it. The entertainment was very limited and the sound quality was terrible. The staff were non existent and inattentive.,,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,1.0,,1,no,2.0,3.0,

The crew were delightful and the seating very comfortable. There were long lines at the check in and there were long lines at the other airline check in counters but they moved along and were very efficient. The biggest problem I observed was the minority demanding public that seem to think it was their right to have everything go their own way. I can only imagine that it was this mob that left their seating space like a tip once we had disembarked.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,5.0,,5,yes,5.0,4.0,

I have flown with them for 4 years and when I speak to someone to get it changed they try to charge me $150 more than what it would cost me to rebook and lose the money I first booked with.

2012-06-25,5,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,I've flown Jetstar many times and over the last half dozen flights have opted for business class seats. On 11th June we returned from Phuket to Sydney once again in business class. I have to say the food provided on this flight was very disappointing. Very little difference to what companions were given in economy class. Bland tasteless muck. We did have metal cutlery! Once the meal was served the attendants seamed to disappear and even getting a fresh bottled water was a chore. I'm not convinced the extra cost over economy is actually good value. The seats are comfortable if you're above average height and you do get off the flight first upon arrival making it quicker at immigration. overall though I think they need to lift their game. In their favour I did think the food quality was better on the Sydney to Thailand leg maybe they need to look at the suppliers in Thailand?,,,,,,,,4.0,3.0,,3,no,2.0,3.0,
2012-06-25,1,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,"You can't check-in until 2hrs before flight. But you must check in at least 1/2 hr before - no exceptions - or then you lose your ticket. This means check-in counter staff are idle until each flight opens - then bombarded - by the people who are all waiting just outside the check in queue anyway. They usually don't use air- bridges so you have to walk in the weather across the tarmac. You kind of expect that on a little Dash-8 at a regional airport - but not on a big jet in a capital city. As per Jetstar website seat pitch on the A320 is 28"" - not 30"". All other Aussie airlines have 30-33"". That makes a big difference on a 5.2hr flight BNE-PER. Seats only recline about 4 degrees back as a result. You can't even get a drink of water for less than $3.50. No room in overhead lockers because they're full of carry-on luggage from those who won't pay $18 for checked luggage - but will happily pay for numerous $7 bourbons en-route. You can't move to spare seats because they are sold to someone. The worst aspect: You can't check your bags through on multiple domestic flights (only on some international). You have to get your bags after each flight and then re-check for the next flight and re-clear security. A pain when there's 5 hrs between flights (remember - can't check in until 2hrs before) but worse if your flights are close & first flight is late. For inflight entertainment you do have the option of paying $10 for an iPad but these are limited.",,,Economy Class,,,,,1.0,4.0,,2,no,1.0,1.0,
2012-06-24,6,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Flight: In last month. Travelled CNS to KIX return in Business Class. Service was ok. However the cabin team leader had a bit of an attitude problem. My wife's side of the plane go to choose bread types etc while I had the team leader giving service and you got what you were given. After meal was served crew were scarce and spent time gossiping in galley. The thing that irritated me the most was the fact people were allowed children on their knee in business who screamed thru the whole trip. As far as I'm concerned you pay the extra for piece and quiet. I have travelled this service 6 months previously and thought the service had dropped since then. Although the fares were very cheap I would rather pay more and receive superior child free service.,,,Business Class,,,,,3.0,3.0,,3,no,2.0,2.0,

The cabin crew tried hard but it seems to lack the refinement of other airlines. Crew really helpful. Seats comfortable. Avoid window seats because once the row in front reclines it's a big effort to get out. Food and wine okay. Entertainment limited with personal sets. I guess you get what you pay for.

The meal service choice was good - had a delicious lamb casserole. The staff were attentive and I had trouble getting extra drinks. The on demand entertainment system worked fine and the choice was okay. Overall I found the experience was good. The only gripe I had was the unseat power failed halfway during the journey.

2012-06-13,2,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Flew the Jetstar equivalent of business class this week (SIN-MEL) and was very disappointed hardly any leg room hard uncomfortable seats which do no recline much food quality was poor and selection of on demand movies and TV shows was also severely limited. I asked for a pillow and was told there was a 'blow up one' in the amenities bag. It was an extremely uncomfortable neck pillow and the expected duvet was in fact an old grey blanket. The overall offering from Jetstar just does not come anywhere close to competing with Air Asia's lay flat beds in their Premium Class with pillows and duvets. Jetstar does not even given priority baggage to business class passengers! Definitely not worth paying the extra money stick to economy if flying Jetstar.,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,,1,no,1.0,2.0,
2012-06-11,7,Australia,,Jetstar Airways customer review,Launceston-Melbourne return 7th June. Both flights on time or early. A320 clean and flights uneventful. Check-in quick and easy and as usual this is strictly a no frills method of travel one step up from coach travel. Crew friendly to Melbourne but on return trip crew was abrupt and a little rude. I have a disability and they offered me no assistance with my bag in the overhead compartment and seem to avoid me when I am lifting and holding a walking stick. On the flight from Launceston one male crew member was a little more sympathetic but they always seem to go out of their way to avoid dealing with anything other than the norm. I use the airline regularly and the fares are usually reasonable but I am mindful that the crew are usually not interested and do the bare minimum.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,3.0,,4,yes,0.0,0.0,
2012-06-11,2,United States,,Jetstar Airways customer review,SYD-HNL Star Class. Typically poor experience on Jetstar. Exceedingly long queue for business class check-in of 45 minutes they were checking in 3 flights using only one counter for business class. Several agents standing around doing nothing. Inflight experience leaves a lot to be desired. Star class bears no resemblance to international business class standards. Seats are much more akin to US domestic airlines first class seats with limited recline limited legroom and a worthless footrest. When the passenger in front of me reclined my knees were jammed against the seat. I measured 6 inches of space between the seatback and the front edge of my seat. Do not be fooled into thinking this class is a bargain at any price. Cabin service was cool and indifferent. Cabin attendants served meals and disappeared for the rest of the flight. Certainly not worth the money and extremely poor value.,,,Business Class,,,,,1.0,2.0,,2,no,2.0,3.0,

Tight legroom made a bit more bearable for short flights by having magazines etc behind the headrests rather than jammed up against one's knees. On the forward journey I observed the cabin manager briefing a passenger with mobility issues about safety aspects of the flight. She displayed a truly caring and professional approach and I was impressed. On both flights most people were fairly obviously leisure flyers - I am happy to travel Jetstar when flying for leisure but would not recommend it for business travellers.,,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,4.0,,4,yes,0.0,0.0,
