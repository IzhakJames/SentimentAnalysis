2024,"My flight to Singapore was uneventful as usual except the aircraft cleanliness was bad. Upon arrival in Singapore, I found my suitcase badly dented and reported the damaged to Scoot's handling agent, SATS in Singapore. SATS will not handle the damage and directed me to to claim from Scoot Insurance Assessor online. That evening I dutifully submitted the claim with all supporting photos from SATS, boarding pass, etc. Response was prompt however unhelpful, it directed me to claim from my travel insurer which I refused. A reply from the Scoot's assessor requesting the same documents that were submitted in the online claim. Resend. Reply again requesting for same documents. Explained and objected. Reply and requesting for more photos! The whole process made my trip rather unpleasant! I decided to ignore that email. I was only claiming SGD 200 for the 2 year old damaged suitcase. I will definitely not recommend flying Scoot to friends!",1,0.9995160102844238,1
2024,Using super old plane. Aircon was blowing warm air and the whole cabin is like sauna. Everyone is flipping for air using the airline safety cardboard. A disgrace to Singapore airline,1,0.9988064765930176,1
2024,"I travelled with my sister, my elderly parent and my toddler son taking Scoot from Haikou to Singapore. The journey was a pleasant one despite the episode of my child became very unwell, alternating between drowsy and cranky in the mid of the journey. We sought the crew for help. They are very professional, helpful and friendly. They checked us out first, discussed with their captain and then prep us on the travel duration and preparation on ground. Besides, they offered ice pack/wet kitchen towels along the way. Nearing to the destination, they even moved me and my son to the front row. The flight arrived 20 minutes earlier. After that, they connected me and my son with the ground crew Firliza who accompanied us to airport clinic for medical treatment.",0,0.0011751976562663913,0

2024,"Very rude male flight attendant. Accessed the rear toilet onboard after being ushered in by a female fight attendant. Upon starting to use the toilet (after about 15 seconds) there was a very load banging on the door. As I started to stop proceedings and get presentable the banging noise increased and so I rushed to get out asap. As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable. Extremely poor passenger consideration.",1,0.99967360496521,1
2024,"Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions. A disgrace to Singapore.",1,0.9997226595878601,1
2024,"We had a thoroughly unpleasant experience checking in for a Scoot flight at Singapore Changi Airport. We had already checked in online, and arrived at the airport to collect physical boarding passes and drop-off luggage. When we arrived, we were unable to print the boarding passes at the automated stations and approached several counter staff for help. Instead of assisting us, we were repeatedly told to ""just queue"". However, when we reached the front of the queue, we were told that check in for our flight had closed and refused to let us board. They referred us to another counter, where we were blamed for not approaching them earlier and were again refused boarding. We finally escalated the issue to a manager, who realised that we had already checked in online and needed to get to the gate quickly for boarding. We rushed over and made our flight. Although we made our flight, our Scoot experience was a complete nightmare. The counter staff were unhelpful, unpleasant and in desperate need of proper training.",1,0.9994118213653564,1

2024,"I am blown away by how unfriendly and unhelpful Scoot is. This is customer service at its absolute worst. Cheap, efficient and inflexible. My wife and I bought tickets from Sydney to Yogyakarta. I knew I might need to change my flight for work, but that my wife wouldn't. I explained that to the online agent, who told me to pay extra and get a flexible ticket but because booking together I would have to pay for flexible ticket for both of us, so I did that. On the day of my flight I discovered that I would indeed need to extend my stay I. Singapore, so got to the airport early and asked the staff to flex my ticket. They said they couldnt do it in Sydney, but I could do it in Singapore no problems. We landed in Singapore and the service desk said they could only change the ticket for one month and at a high fee, and that I should ring the 24/7 call centre. I rang the call centre and they had a recorded message saying they were too busy and to use the online chat. I spent an hour on the online chat, only to be told I couldn't change it online because I had already flown the first leg, even though that is what their staff told me to do! So I got up and went back to the airport with my wife to check her in, and make the one month change, only to be told by the morning staff that that was impossible and that the maximum I could change my ticket by was one week. The entire time, at every single stage of interaction the staff were grumpy, rude and every person tried to fob me off to someone else. This was also true of the staff on the plane. I have never experienced an airline that is so consistently mean spirited and where the staff are grumpy.  Unfriendly, focused on being cheap and efficient at the cost of any sense of hospitality.",1,0.996859073638916,1

I asked the flight attendant at Taiwan for my second flight information, the flight attendant simply inform me that she didnt know and ask me to find information at singapore airport.  Flight attendant at singapore airline help me to arrange to next flight which is fine. I kept asking whether I still need to check in my baggage manually but she told me that they will arrange it for me. When i arrived at Bali for baggage claim, I waited for 3 hours for my baggage which i found that my baggage still in Singapore.

2024,"Overall a fine flight experience. The worst part of flying with Scoot was that I was overcharged $70 on my inflight purchase and have been chasing this up since October last year. I have had no updates (not a single email or phone call) sent to me about the status of refund, the customer service team show no skill at fixing this issue and the last staff member I spoke to over the phone had an attitude and was completely unhelpful. Apparently there was also a problem with the process as they didnt have the cardholders name and I only found out about this through multiple calls to them. Fine to fly with but I wouldn't wish try to chase up any issues with them. Would not recommend. Worst customer service experience and problem resolution I've ever had.",1,0.9993388056755066,1
2024,"When I first flew Scoot a few years ago, the ""premium"" class was called Scoot Biz although it was really just a premium economy product. It was an excellent alternative to flying normal economy class being good value, good service with the comfort of a smaller cabin, bigger seats and priority check-in etc. The premium cabin has been renamed Scoot Plus some time ago but product remained the same. However, things appear to have changed. The cabin on this flight was dirty, the crew disinterested, the ""one"" complimentary drink served with the meal can no longer be a choice including wine/beer as you can only buy this as apparently the policy has changed and only water, soft drink, tea or coffee can be chose. I was informed I could only buy a wine when the Scoot Cafe opens. The meals were served immediately the flight reached cruising altitude and were being collected before I had even started. The lights were dimmed during the meal service and the crew disappeared. Other passengers started ringing the bell to order from the Scoot Cafe as it seems no trolley was going to appear. I thought selling food and drinks was the way to make money on these budget airlines! The crew freely allowed passengers from the back of the plane to use the one and only lavatory in the front of the premium cabin. I paid a lot of money for this flight for me, my wife and daughter (being the end of the school holidays in Australia) and was extremely disappointed in the standard of pretty much everything on this and another recent Scoot flight.",1,0.9993465542793274,1

2024,"Note that when you do online check-in, the system will assign you seats starting from the last row. I do not know about this and went to check in exactly 48h as per recommended thus was being assigned the worst seats ever. Non-reclined chair and near the toilet. The system is not smart enough to know that I'm travelling in group of 4 and to assign seats to us together thus I was assigned 3 seats in row 30 (right side of aircraft) and 1 seat in row 29 (left window seat of aircraft). I tried to change the seats by calling the call centre but they couldn't. The agent escalated my case and told me will return a call to me the next day for an update. However, she did not. So I decided to call back and found out that she had knocked off work for that day. I tried to communicate with other agents regarding my case but eventually it was still unresolved. Also, their manager was unhelpful and avoided clarifying my issues with me. He said that he would escalate the matter to HQ and will update by the end of his work shift. But he did not do so as well. This resulted in me calling the call centre serveral times as I could not reach the manager nor the first agent that handled my case. Eventually, when I spoke to 2 of his agents regarding my case, they hung up my call as they said that they couldn't assist me and had to attend to other customers. I was upset with how unprofessional they had attended to my seat flight case and the empty promises that the agents said they will return me a call but no one had ever returned a call to me until I persisted in my callings to reach one of them. However, I'm grateful that when I approached the check in counter staff during my departure, the front counter staff managed to change the seats as there were still available seats on the flight.

2023,"Take note that Scoot seats are not random assigned if you checked in online. The system assigned seats starting from the last row. I called Scoot on 17 Dec to speak with an agent  with regards to the seat assignment as I did not know seats are assigned in this structure. She said its true that seats are assigned from starting from the last row but she is unable to assist to change my seats unless I pay. Another agent also claims that ""its a secret that the system assigned starting from the last row"". I told the agent its unfair to not make this known to customers especially when its a common understanding that last row seats are one of the worst seats to sit. My conversations with Scoot lasted even till 29 Dec and little resolution was given. Scoot kept delaying my issue and I believe this is one of their tactic to shun the customer away.  Those who are reading my review, I would just like to alert you to be cautious of your conversations with Scoot staff as many of them are not reliable.

Arriving Melbourne, also it was not provided. to take note: They made my aged mother, who has difficulties in walking long distance, walk all the way from the check in counter to the aircraft in Singapore and walk from the aircraft till checkout in Melbourne. I chatted with one staff on the chat option from Singapore. Said she will ""escalate"" the matter immediately and I will get a reply in 3 days. I called Scoot Melbourne, after the chat with Singapore Scoot, to ask if this will be done in Melbourne. Gave me an excuse that it is done by the ground staff. Informed them that Scoot was the one who promised this, and it was their responsibility to get one. I kept repeating myself so many times. It was clear that the person speaking to me on the phone was lacking the understanding language of simple English. Once again, the same incident happened in Melbourne. No wheelchair. After waiting for 2 weeks and having no reply from them so called ""escalating"" the incident, I decided to chat with them again. Same response ""escalated the matter"" and they are investigating!

First, their website showed the flight as sold out, but I was able to book online, but they charge you an extra fee to book online. Yes, this company charges extra just to sell you a ticket. Then the flight was very late. We didn't board until after the official cut off time for boarding had actually passed. Once onboard, the flight attendants were rude and curt. Then, they couldn't get the plane off the ground, so on top of being 30 minutes late, they couldn't take off for nearly another hour. So the plane finally took off well over an hour late. Most ridiculous, was that the seat next to me was empty, and I set my jacket on that seat. The flight attendant made me remove my jacket from the seat for takeoff, and also remove my headphones. No US carrier makes you remove your headphones for takeoff. Is this an Asian thing, or are they that challenged that they think that is an effective safety measure. Lastly, this seat is so uncomfortable, it is curved so much my spine feels like it is doing the Cow yoga pose. This is a terrible airline and I would never fly it again.

They have silly policies enforced by incredibly rude and unhelpful flight attendants that definitely do not put the customer first. Seat comfort is awful if you're a little taller than average, especially for a long flight. Lots of additional charges and lots of annoying rules make this flight more frustrating.

The airline has a strict ""no-waiver"" policy which is out to ""eat"" (take advantage of) customers, Scoot is an airline which does not put customer first, and is just a very unempathetic business which fare rules are outright unreasonable. The customer service support is terrible as they would dismiss your emails and do not give a dam about your urgent email request. The hotline staff are reluctant to go the extra mile by escalating your request to the management for serious consideration. They do not care about the passengers satisfaction.

2023,"Knowing that the flight was full, Scoot assigned me and my family seats for free when I was supposed to pay. Upon check-in, I was met by a stern and unfriendly ground staff member, and that unfriendliness continued with the ground staff handling the boarding gate. They looked depressed, pressured, and tired as if they hated their job. However, once on board, the team of flight attendants changed the mood of the flight. They ensured everyone was well looked after with their positive attitude throughout the flight. The seats gave me extra few inches of legroom and were surprisingly comfortable. That, combined with the A320NEO's new cabin feel, was a perfect recipe for a clean, comfortable, and awesome flight. The in-flight entertainment was rich in content and easy to use, however, being a Wi-Fi-based entertainment used by many people on the flight, the signal strength was incredibly weak. That, and the less-than-good ground staff team at Yogyakarta, were the only two things preventing this flight from getting a solid 10/10. The landing was around 10 minutes ahead of schedule, and the ground staff team in Singapore quickly arranged our bags at a special spot thanks to the long immigration queue in Singapore.

You get what youre paying for, so I am not really expecting great perks, comfort, or customer service as long as they get me safely to my destination. Thats the deal. However, I wont stand dishonest and cheating businesses and Scoot is a great example of that. On my last trip with them, I was told upon checking in, that I had 11 euro credit on my account and the lady at the counter was not able to give me my ticket till I pay. She did not tell me what this payment was for (I asked, but she didnt know) and redirected me to the cashier (who was supposed to give me all the details). There, again, I was told that he didnt know any details of the payment (sort this out directly with the airline), just that I need to pay. So 2 hours before my flight to Australia I was running back and forth between two Scoot desks to find out what was this about with no luck, no one gave me any info. I was nave enough to think that this was probably just a system issue  I gave up and paid, I thought I would resolve the issue with customer service afterward. Wow, how stupid I was. I sent the refund request via Scoot website explaining the situation. I got the reply that the charge was for the seat selection, which I apparently requested and on which I was apparently informed. So, now I am on my 5th complaint email, saying that I have never requested a seat and they are saying that I had. I ended up paying for the service I have never received, and they do not even have the decency to take responsibility for their mistakes.",1,0.9992489218711853,1

2023,"Extremely slow counter service, flight was supposed to take off at 2pm, but people still stuck at the check-in counter. For some reason people could bring in multiple carry-on luggages and were allowed to use other seats' overhead compartments, causing massive delays as flight crew had to re-stow luggage into cargo for other passengers who rightfully had the compartments for their own use. Did the counter crew not check boarding passengers and allowed one person to bring in not only 2 suitcases but also multiple bags? We had a Karen who not only used one full compartment for her 4 bags of souvenirs, but still had the gall to demand crew to leave her suitcases with her when they were trying to stow them into cargo. Cabin crew is trying their best, but people are extremely inconsiderate so maybe have more stringent checks. It has been almost 25 minutes delay now due to counter checking incompetence and flight has still not hit the runway. Do not recommend.",1,0.9988429546356201,1
2023,Purchased internet on the flight. Connection is slow and unstable. There is no way for you to reconnect back once you disconnected from the WIFI. The price of USD15 for 80Mb means you check up email and finish all the 80Mb data in 5 minutes. For an 11-hour flight from Singapore to Athens there is no free water served. The concept of customer service is non existent. Will not fly with Scoot again.,1,0.9991933703422546,1
2023,"I reviewed this previously and this post is to verify my previous claim and comments but also to post the response from Scoot Customer Service, or lack thereof. At no time did we seek a refund from Scoot what we sought was that they come to the party with a nights accommodation for the enforced layover in Singapore. They never responded to any emails until we had returned to Australia and then waited several days before doing so. I have included the text of their email for readers benefit. Dear A Thank you for writing to us. We refer to your refund request for Scoot booking received through our Online Feedback Form. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience caused to the change in flight schedule that may have disrupted your travel plan. We understand the impact on our passengers when there are changes in our flight schedule. However, we want to reassure you that we will only make changes if necessary. As schedules are subject to changes, Scoot will make every effort to get our passengers to their destination within a reasonable time from their original schedule. We regret that we are unable to offer any options. We seek your understanding on this occasion if our service level did not meet your expectation. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to seeing you onboard. Yours sincerely, Scoot shall never enjoy our continued support and they will never see us onboard again.",1,0.9731059074401855,1

2023,"This was the final flight of our ill conceived use of Scoot to fly to and from Vietnam. This was yet another flight that was rescheduled without advice to us by Scoot. Our original booking would have seen us travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore to Perth in the course of a day rather than have an enforced stopover of 18 hours in Singapore which allowed time to eat, bathe and sleep before returning to the airport. Boarding was disorganised and the flight was delayed upon departure by about an hour. Our pre booked seats were changed without advice and we ended up four rows from the toilets at various times there was the overpouring stench of stale urine in the cabin. both my partner and I used the toilets and prior to her being able to use them she had to do a clean with disinfectant wipes and tissues. Disgraceful it reflects poorly on the airline, cabin crew and our fellow passengers personal hygiene practices. None of our flights with Scoot departed on schedule each flight was re scheduled without notification to us. What is unfortunate about this experience is part of our decision was based upon past travel with Singapore Airlines, Scoots parents company. It is not a good look to be associated with such a poorly operated and managed low cost carrier who has little care or concern for its passengers. In Singapore Airlines case its association with Scoot is a race to the bottom. Scoot is little more than riding a public bus.",1,0.9997742772102356,1

Had we not done so we would have been unaware of the change. We were re scheduled to Scoot TR 307 some 6 hours later as a consequence we were faced with an 18 hour layover in Singapore which wasnt what we wanted or needed. Queries to Scoot about the changes and lack of notification are ignored they dont respond to customer enquiries. The boarding at Ho Chi Minh was confusing there was an unannounced gate change and the flight dissapeared from the nominated gate. It was not until I confronted staff at the new gate that an announcement was made advising the gate change. The process of boarding was even more confusing a free for all in fact.

I neglected to mention that as this flight was delayed by three hours, Scoot gave us two meal vouchers valued at $15.00 each which could only be redeemed at a certain airport store. For the Total of AUD $30 we received two stale egg and lettuce sandwiches and two cheese and crackers, there were no hot options.. Mid flight they gave us some type of childs snack/toy pack.

2023,"Penang to Melbourne via Singapore. Our flight TR423 experienced a delay of approximately one hour due to an inbound flight delay. Upon our arrival at the Singapore airport, the crew members on TR423 requested that we move to the front seats in order to facilitate a quicker disembarkation. I would like to extend my appreciation to those Scoot crew members for their assistance. However, upon reaching Gate 35 at 2:20 am, I encountered two Scoot ground members who not only failed to provide us with directions to the gate as expected, but also informed us, along with five other passengers on the same route, that we were not allowed to proceed to the TR18 gate. Instead, they insisted that we go to terminal 3 to catch the Singapore Airlines flight SQ207 to Melbourne. During this time, one of the passengers was chatting with a friend on TR18 via WeChat and was informed that the TR18 flight was still at the gate, with the door open and waiting for us. We immediately conveyed this information to the Scoot ground members, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Shockingly, despite being aware of the situation, the two ground members adamantly refused our request and directed us to the SATs Lounge. When I inquired about the refund for the Economy to Economy Plus seat upgrade that I had paid for, I was simply told to contact Scoot online for assistance. As a result of their refusal, the doors of TR18 closed promptly at 2:55 am, preventing me from boarding the flight.",1,0.9930323362350464,1

Had we not done an online check in we would have arrived at the airport and missed the rescheduled flight. At no time were we made aware of the changes either by Scoot or Flight Centre. Nor were we advised that our return flights from Ho Chi Minh had also been substantially altered so that what should have been a 2 hour transit became an 18 hour transit. More on that later. The flights were 2 hours late departing we were given some sort of childs gift pack as compensation. Attempts to raise the matter have seen many emails sent without a plausible response. They now deny there was a booking at all and no longer respond. Just another junk low cost carrier, pity its backed by Singapore Airlines it reflects badly on them.

After I submitted my claim to their insurer, it took weeks before they responded. And every time they respond, they would keep asking the same set of documents which I already submitted. So approximately 4 months now and I havent received anything from them.

But when I was in airport the flight was further delayed for another hour. I boarded and the plane went on circling for another 1 hour. Flight attendees were rude to me. Scoot gave me a $30 voucher during the flight delay probably the only slight saving grace however, the staff at the counter was just playing her phone texting.

She came back with one of their packaged blankets (more like a thin polyester sheet) and said I could use it as a cushion! Because the plane was full, they couldn't reseat me (there were seats in the Scoot Plus section) and the crew insisted that I sit on the broken seat for the entire flight. They had no interest in resolving the problem, just kept asking me what they should do! The cabin attendant ended up forcing a man to swap seats with me. Not really a good solution!

2023,"This review refers to the flight with Scoot from Berlin to Bali (via Singapore) and the corresponding return flight a few weeks later. The points apply to all legs of the journey, although the long haul Berlin-Singapore and back is clearly more significant and determines the rating. Scoot advertises itself as the small subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (""The little sister of Singapore Airlines""). This is certainly correct in terms of content, but it is absolutely misleading. The service Scoot offers has nothing to do with the fantastic Singapore Airlines! Absolute nothing! Scoot is an absolute no-frills airline in its purest form, even worse than Ryanair. The passenger has to pay for everything. It starts when booking with the food on board, continues with extra luggage and seat reservations. If you don't pay for your seat, a seat will be allocated to you during check-in without any choice for you. And, on board, the customers' money continues to be taken out of their pockets. If you want to drink water on board, which real airlines serve free of charge and in abundance to their passengers for health reasons, you have to pay for it at Scoot. There is no entertainment programme on board, not even monitors to track the flight route. If you use your mobile phone, tablet, etc., you will definitely run out of power during a 12-13 hour flight. There are power sockets, but if you want electricity for charging, you have to pay for it. Regarding the service on board: The staff was always friendly and nice. Thank you for that. But, the food is pretty much the most unappealing and uncharitable food I have seen in my life. And it doesn't even taste good. You are given simple, welded food containers and a can of water. If you know real quality airlines, what Scoot delivers is a huge disappointment. On the return flight SIN-BER, the folding tables (several in my row) were so dirty. I guess they have not been cleaned for a long time. Thank god I had disinfectant and a cloth with me. Yikes, Scoot! In summary, it must be said that the customer at Scoot is apparently only there to flush money into the company. There is no question of appreciation of the flight guests. These flights fall into the category: There is no second chance for a first impression. We flew exactly twice with Scoot, the first and the last time. I would rather spend a little more money on a real, good airline than fly long-haul with Scoot again. For short-haul (up to about 3 hours, it's ok).",1,0.997731626033783,1

I claimed my entitled compensation from Scoot, to be told they had emailed me on the 7th July and informed me of the cancellation (and no its not in my junk folder, I checked with my private email provider) they had not made contact with me, they are basically just lying as this gets them out of having to pay compensation. I asked for proof of this and received something a 10 year old could have knocked up in photoshop, It did not prove anything.

I never experienced something like this on an intercontinental flight, I thought it was not even allowed. You could of course buy something but totally overprice, like a small cola for 5 euros. Honestly, low cost has gone too far. The seats were as small as the ones of a 2 hours Ryanair flight, but for 13 hours.

However, after boarding the flight to Bangkok minutes just before the plane took off, the airline staff requested us to vacate the seats and move to the back row seats as though they did not know we had paid for front extra leg room seas (I shown them the receipts and boarding pass).

We got a voucher and thought we could fly Scoot Plus business class with the voucher later. The voucher was only a substitute for a refund that we were entitled to.  This is not the case with Scoot. When we booked the replacement flight, there was only Business Class in a Boeing on the route from Bangkok to Singapore, on the return flight only Economy due to a different aircraft and we had to pay extra for excess baggage, for the seat and for boarding first. In total, we paid 47%  extra for worse conditions. On the outward flight, everything worked okay. Scoot cannot organise an immigration fast track for Business Class customers. Long before the trip, we received an email that the departure time had changed. The reason for this was another change of aircraft back to Boeing. That there was now a Business Class after all was not disclosed. At check-in, we were given an Eco ticket in the last row of the plane, although we had been confirmed seats in the first row and had paid a surcharge for them. There was no mention of the paid first boarding. Only after a massive protest the check-in manager gave us seats a little further forward. We were told that Business Class was fully booked. Arriving at the gate, we found an inadequate small waiting room in which the passengers had to wait standing up like sardines in a can. I asked a Scoot employee for a seat and received a shrug.

I don't expect much from a low fare airline, but the way the handle their customers is not satisfactory. Our flight from Singapore to London via Bangkok, and according to my booking confirmation, we would remain seated for the short stop in BKK. In reality we landed in Bangkok, everyone had to leave the plane, go through security and then back into the plane 30 mins later. Then we sat there in the plane for 1 hour without much information before the pilot tells us that the plane (787) is not airworthy due to a mechanical error, and they need to organise a new plane. Then we were given a voucher for food and told that a new plane was set up at 8pm, then they said 11pm, then 12am (14 hours later). Everyone had to leave the plane, go through security before scrambling to figure out what to do next. According to their website ""when a flight has been delayed (retiming is the word they use) by more than 4 hours, we have 3 choices: voucher, refund or change flight date."" Fair enough, I want to change the date. But according to airport information, there is no Scoot counter or Scoot staff in the airport until 12 hours later, so calling Scoot is the only possibility other than waiting 12 hours. So I call Scoot twice, because the first operator got disconnected and I have no way of getting back to him, so I have to queue 10 mins again. After explaining that the plane I'm waiting 14 hours for is not currently up in the air, but is in fact delayed (they were clueless and kept on insisting that I must be on the plane, in the air), they would not allow me to change or cancel my flight. Why? Because I am in transit, and if I wanted a refund/change, I should have done it before taking off from Singapore (I obviously didn't know the plane was going to be delayed back then, and I was even told we would not disembark in Bangkok).

Upon boarding realised that ScootPlus was more than half empty and inquired on the rates for an upgrade only to be told we would be charged the full fee of $310. While I understand the logic in a bid where the misc fees already paid for seats, food etc. would boost the chances of securing the upgrade, I don't see the case since we were already onboard, had reasonably comfortable seats, with meals reserved and couldn't take advantage of the additional baggage that an upgrade provided and so didn't proceed. Scoot could have earned additional $362 if both of us had upgraded without incurring additional costs but it didn't happen because of its illogical pricing and many ScootPlus seats were left empty. Mid-flight I walked around the cabin only to realised that many rows of first row seats in economy were empty when it was indicated full when I made my seat reservations.

2020,"Due to severe reduction of flights from Singapore to Hong Kong because of CoVid-19, I could not choose to fly with my favourite: Singapore Airlines, all their afternoon flights have been cut. I was left with the only reasonably priced option: Scoot. For today (Mar 12th), their 787 was deployed, and I was rather curious and looked forward to trying it. I had problems with check in at their computer kiosk, was directed to the assistance counter to complete my check in. The lady was not friendly nor very helpful. Never mind, hopefully the flight experience will make up for it. For today, no meals or duty free will be available to purchase. Instead, each passenger was given a bottle of water and a packaged croissant. I was sat the the so called quiet zone, load factor was very low, they still insisted to sit a lady in our seat of 3, where she could have any other seats (all 3 to herself!), not her fault but the airlines. The thing to do would be to move to another empty to give her more room (and myself), I was not allowed to. I was told due to the virus situation, passengers must not move to any seats for tracing purpose later if necessary. As a result, all 3 of us squeezed onto 6 D,E and F, endured a very uncomfortable flight, inside a 30% full cabin, thanks to the cunning arrangement of the check in agent. I had to take Scoot because I had no other choice, and they did not show me that flying with them had any benefits, besides the low price. 787 usually is very nice plane, but when it becomes a Scoot plane, it looked cheap and tattered everywhere, with very tight seat pitch, cabin crew were so so, doing the bare minimum.

After asking him for a while to verify everything he was just sitting there and replying all the same ""I cannot"" . I asked to give me my boarding pass only to Singapore and he told me I cant get it as well cause I need flight back and if I buy a new ticket in front of him he can give it to me otherwise I wont get anything and simply losing all my flights. I asked for a manager and he refused to call the manager or somebody, I asked to provide me a complaint form and he refused to do so, he refused to give even a phone call to somebody who knows more then him.  All I wanted is to go home and not being stuck in Indonesia. Somehow I was able to get my boarding pass to Singapore from other agent who was very nice an understanding, she checked everything and verified that I actually can get my boarding pass. Thanks to other employee I was able to fly home without problems. As a company who are involved in international flights every employee should be familiar with every aspect of international travels.

Around 200 AUD one way. Overall my experience was not too bad. If you expect something fancy from this budget airline, you have to ask something, what is important? Is comfort important or simply getting from point A to B? I chose the latter. Most of the time I took a nap while listening to music, so I wasn't in too much discomfort. Leg room was decent. My advice bring your own pillow if you have trouble sleeping on the plane. Overall Scoot did the job. This isn't Singapore Airlines in any manner.

The entire process took about 5 hours and we waited patiently only to be told Melbourne authorities had given a red flag to depart and that we are to disembark only to start the process of standing at the counter all over again. We had to go through immigration and back to check in counter.

2020,"I took Scoot on a return flight from Melbourne to Singapore. There's no in-flight entertainment, but this is acceptable given that it's a budget flight. What is unacceptable is the lack of cabin service. On the first flight, I was told by a crew member that no outside food was allowed. This is unreasonable as I have strict dietary requirements and could consume none of the main meals offered on board. None of the other airlines that I have flown with have ever picked an issue with passengers bringing their own food on board. I tried to buy a packet of nuts with my debit card but the crew first rejected my debit card, and asked for cash or credit card (which I had none), without giving any reasons. Only after I asked for the reasons that I found out that there is a limit of $20 spending on debit cards and they are phasing out debit card payments. I'm certain this wasn't made known to passengers prior to boarding. This is terrible for passengers on long haul flights who aren't aware of this limit, on top of the fact that Scoot does not allow outside food or serve water for free. The return flight was dismal. I had paid for a seat upgrade but found out that my seat could not recline as the button had dropped out. This was obviously a problem that the airline had previously known of, as there was duct tape around the sharp edges around where the button would have been. I highlighted this to the a cabin crew and her response was ""oh ya, doesn't work. Sorry about that"" and tried to walk off! I had to ask if there was a replacement seat, and (of course) there wasn't any in the same seat class. The cabin crew also talk over passengers to each other across the aisles and can come across as quite curt in their instructions / responses to passengers. I get that Scoot is trying to create a young and less formal vibe but there needs to be more courtesy in the way the cabin crew treat passengers. It is honestly quite embarrassing that Scoot is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, which prides itself on its high standards of service.

2023,For a budget airline its not bad you pay extra for everything and I knew this going into the flight. So I ordered two meals and had two waters. About 6 1/2 hours into my flight I went to the back of the plane and ask the attendant for a cup of ice to drink my water in so I could take my medicine. She said no ice on plane. Muffled with the post Covid mask on. I went back to my seat and drank my water and took my medicine.  The WiFi didnt work on both legs unless you wanted to order something from the attendant.

2023,"I flew ZIPAIR from LAX in Los Angeles to Narita airport in Japan on 11/1. I had arrived a few minutes after the one-hour boarding deadline had passed. To my surprise, the friendly counter lady was able to check me in along with my two luggage cases and said I was fine with being a few minutes late. Obviously it wasn't my goal to be a few minutes late, but crazy traffic at LAX was the issue here even though I left my home 3 hours before my flight. The flight was smooth with no turbulence and the food was pretty decent. The movie library is pretty limited (only 9 movies), but enough to pass the time. The nightmare started to happen during my next leg of the trip (flight purchased separately) which was departing on 11/4 at 8:55AM from Narita airport in Japan to Incheon airport in Seoul. I had arrived at the check-in counter at around 7:53AM and was concerned about the one-hour boarding deadline. The counter lady was busy assisting another individual, and my wife and I were the last in line to be checked-in. The lady finished the other individual around 7:58AM and as I was heading to speak with her, she said I could not board because the hour deadline had passed. As you can imagine, I was livid and told her that it wasn't my fault she took so long to assist the passenger before me. I said it was not my fault as I had arrived at the line before 7:55AM. We had several back and forth encounters as you can imagine I am out several hundred dollars and she told me I had to book another flight since there were no more ZIPAIR flights leaving Narita that day. She was not helpful at all as I asked how to inquire for a refund. She said you'll get the taxes back. I then asked how do I do that? She said to contact customer service. I asked how do I do it? She said there's no phone number, you'll need to email them. I literally had to ask her questions by piecemeal. This was by far the rudest person I have come across after traveling to Japan several times this year. I will seriously question myself if I was to fly with them again.",1,0.9977157115936279,1

The person working there was nice enough to eventually give up and let me just take a normal amount of carryon with me instead of continuing to try and get it down to 7 pounds. the workers at narita airport check in seemed earnest and happy.

It took a total of about 10 minutes from the time I walked into Tom Bradley terminal to check in and go through security. The seat was exactly what you would get on Japan Airlines business class just without anything extra. If you want anything beyond a great lay flat seat, you do have to pay, but I knew all this since it is pretty clear on their website so I downloaded some TV shows to my laptop, brought my own food and everything was fine.

2023,"My review lays with being periodically harassed and ridiculed about an extension seat belt. Being that I am a plus size woman, I already came prepared and brought/bought my own seat belt extender that fit and connected the first flight to Narita no issues about the seat belt extender, however, there were still multiple times of being awaken out my sleep to pull an arm rest down or not have anything in my lap. Back to the initial complaint, on flight ZG026 to San Francisco on 9/18/23. I got to my seat and I over heard the flight attendants that did not wear name badges, speaking in Japanese about of have to make sure the fat lady has a seat belt extender. This the behavior you allow for your company. Then one comes up to me and pulls the seat belt and extends it then says you need an extender. Not ask but stated that I needed one. Still remaining calm I told her I already have one of my own and proceed to click it to get her smoothly. She leaves and talk with the previous attendant that was talking bad about me and comes back saying its not safe for me to use my own seatbelt extender belt. Then shoves theirs in my hand and says be sure to give this back at the end of flight and stayed until I removed mine and connected theirs to the seat belt. The attendant walks off says something else that I could not fully hear but definitely heard Im going to mark her seat down so she doesnt steals it to the previous attendant they both laugh. I proceeded to state I really dont need this extension belt and you two are making me uncomfortable and we havent even taken off. They lie and says its policy and then walk off. Fast forward to 2/3 of the flight nearly ending the same attendant wakes me out of my sleep to tell me dont forget to leave the extension belt in the seat when I leave. I calmly say ok even though I am boiling because of the assumption of assuming that Im going to steal a extension belt extender, then when we land and the seatbelt light is off. I took off the seat belt and detached everything and left in the seat. The same harassing attendant comes up to me and demands I give her the seatbelt extender. I reach behind me and get it for her and said I thought you wanted me to leave it in the seat but please do take note that you have it back in your hands. Because I am not a thief and do not appreciate being harassed like one. I wish they had name plates so I can post it in this review. Lounge in narita was ok, the white seats are extremely stained and theres no restroom inside it. In conclusion, this is the last time flying with ZIPAIR.",1,0.9940400123596191,1

The C26 counter was said for Bangkok check-in, so I queued in the row for about 15 minutes aiming for it. But then, the C25 Singapore counter was free and called me out.

She realized her mistake when she saw the sign above the counter and the C26 staff told her that her counter was really for Bangkok.

I dont need a lot of space or amenities to be content, even though Im not a small guy. That was the initial attraction to ZIPAIR for me, not paying for things I wasnt going to use. Entertainment? Bring your own (every seat has a USB-A charging port and they allow power banks, so dont sweat the electrons). Meals, snacks, and drinks? Offered, but must be paid for separately either before you board, or in-flight via a browser interface using the planes WiFi system. Honestly, fine with me. I brought my own snacks and water on board, and used WiFi to order some drinks. The flights were incredibly smooth, the cabin staff were a vision of professionalism and care, the planes were spotless, and the seat comfort was better than expected despite being in Economy. For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty. Honestly, these are relatively minor complaints (especially WiFi, hardly a necessity), and I feel these in no way diminished the value of what I saved on my fare.

The value for money is way better that's for sure. As is the customer service. In summary: Check in process could have been better. Had to wait in queue for about half an hour. I think all passengers are required to manually check in at a desk for this flight. Or at least we were on this occasion. No fast track for business class.

Things like mouthwash, hand cream, etc. The staff were excellent. Polite, attentive, courteous. The food was good for what it was. I had spicy chicken with rice. It was basically a microwave meal but still tasty. The fruit was fresh and flavoursome. Free Wi-Fi for business class.

That itself was understandable since this is a budget airline. But the seat was not clearly indicated to be non reclining! Imagine 6hrs of sitting upright! Someone ought to be compassionate enough to indicate this to passengers just like what other airlines does.",1,0.9991776347160339,1

2022,"I cannot say enough good things about Zipair. First and foremost is the excellent price for a round trip ticket from LA to Tokyo. With the current exchange rate you can go Business class for under $2,000 R/T, or for under $900 if you fly economy. This is with all the upgrades added. You will spend a little more on snacks and drinks, but that is even cheap with our current exchange rates. The seats are all comfortable and their internet is free. I would recommend downloading some shows prior to take off as the internet did drop a couple of times.",0,0.660885751247406,1
2022,"It was my first time with ZipAir and I was a bit leery of flying so far with a budget airline, but it was an enjoyable experience. Off to a good start, the check-in was fast and efficient. I flew in Standard (economy) class with 3-3-3 seating, which was comfortable with adequate legroom. The basic fare is only for the seat, but I opted for the ""value"" package to get 23 kg checked baggage, seat selection plus a meal (pre-selected from a picture menu) and still saved about $500 over the fares of established airlines. Passengers are required to show their boarding pass during flight to verify the optional upgrade. The tasty meal came in a box on a tray, with just beef and rice next to bottled water. There was no salad, dessert nor other drink, But the free Wi-Fi connected to my smart phone allowed ordering drinks and snacks later, as well as compensating for having no seatback screen. The charming cabin attendants were very safety conscious, double-checking to make sure overhead bins were closed securely. ZipAir should be commended for creating a unique budget flying experience on lengthy international flights. Some earlier negative Skytrax reviews were based on unmet pandemic regulations and refund policies, not the flights themselves, Overall, I highly recommend ZipAir as an alternative to traditional carriers whose fares have skyrocketed on the HNL-NRT route since the pandemic, Just follow the their common sense rules and enjoy the money saved.",0,0.005777293350547552,0
2022,"Twenty years in the film distribution business and never once has an airline refused to allow me to hand carry movie posters in a tube until my first flight with Zipair from NRT-SIN on Nov 4th 2022. They said my poster tube exceeded the dimensions of their overhead compartment. They insist that I paid for another 23kg of check-in luggage when my check-in luggage was 19.5kg of 23kg and my hand carry was only 4.5kg of 7kg. It was very clear that they did not want to listen to my explanation that my luggage was under weight and the poster tube weighed under 2kg. They kept saying that it is company policy. The flight was less than 20% occupied. A Very empty flight. The overhead compartment would have easily contained my poster tube with plenty of space to spare. Poster paper measures 27inch width and 39inch height rolled into a poster tube (cardboard) 2 inches longer than the poster's width.  The cabin crew were unsmiling patrolling the aisles like the police. I found them annoying as they made their presence felt, too much and gave out that I am watching you feeling. And it's not like they were giving out water. You have to pay for it. My pre-paid inflight meal was not bad. The expensive wagyu beef bowl is available and they seemed to have stopped selling their normal beef bowl.(minus points here) Purchased a can of Suntory Premium Beer and Pringles. Paid with a credit card but had to type in my details on their tablet. Prices were reasonable but I had to self-type all the cc details, etc for it to happen. Cash is not accepted for inflight sales. Otherwise, the flight was smooth., cabin was clean (hardly any pax) Less rigidity and friendly cabin crew may improve business. Keep your current attitude and Scoot will benefit most with their flexibility and surprisingly professional and charming cabin crew on my SIN-NRT flight on the same trip.

2022,"Horrible experience. They say that my luggage is too big for cabin, because it doesnt fit a small box they had. But inside the airplane there was not only plenty of space but Ive flown with the same suitcase carry-on for years. So they had me pay a fee to take the luggage to checked baggage. I asked them if they can make it cheaper if I take stuff out. I had 15kg. They said no, 6500 yen is the cheapest. Then I looked on the website and the cheapest was under 14kg with 5500 yen. I came to the airport 3h before departure and waited and waited at the gate. I saw then boarding two other destinations (Singapore and Bangkok) before they started with Los Angeles (my destination). I went there one hour before departure because I was worried. They said that the gates are closed and we cant het checked in, I said I was there for 3h and not once did I hear them call the LAX flight.  They eventually let all of us in and we managed to get on the plane.  I just wanted the minimum amount of respect and professionalism when dealing with customers. If one of them complains, its maybe the customer whos crazy. But when you have 3 passengers not checked in because they didnt know where/when to do it, then there must be a problem with your system.

At first Zipair said they don't know if they can accept it and to email a copy in. So I emailed a copy and was told they won't accept it. So I called overseas to their Japan HQ and the people there said ""They might accept it at LAX, try your luck"". No I am not going to try my luck. 12 hours before before my flight was to leave they send me an email saying they can accept the consulate paper. Ridiculous that they are so disorganized. Check-in was easy but their online support said they will add TSA precheck when we check-in. At check-in they refused to do so. On the flight you are only given 1 meal, if you paid in advance and 1 bottle of water - it's barely a snack even to Japanese. You are also given the food 1 hour after boarding so enjoy 10 hours of nothing. You will get no more food, water, etc. If you want anything else you have to order it via your phone connected to their in-flight wifi. I ordered a coffee, cost about $2.50 and was brought in a very small cup.  At least when you order snacks they do come fast. In-flight entertainment didn't exist. The system worked on the ground but the second it was airborne all entertainment didn't work. So bring your own movies and entertainment. The seats were clear and nice.

2022,"Zipair is JALs budget airline. They dont have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we arent used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you cant pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we werent allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldnt even change seats on board although the seat on my husbands left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you cant buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasnt enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping. Is that worth $5.5k - only you can answer that.",0,0.9939272403717041,1

I don't think anyone was happy after that flight. 10 hrs flights with no entertainment is another invention I didn't think I'll experience. The flight itself wasn't even that cheap so I'm wondering why not charge 15 euro extra and give everyone all service they should get on such a long flight... the food prices were not even that expensive so I'm just sitting here n wondering why would anyone choose this uncomfortable situation for both the employees and all customers. I will not soon forget the flight attendant lady raising her voice at an older gentleman customer to tell him he can not change his order of food... it was bad.

After having re-arranged the other flights this affected, a couple of weeks before the flight, the alternative was moved to within 2h of the original flight's time. Even days before the flights they kept moving them around making my heart sink every time I got a message from AirAsia with the word urgent in the title. Their customer service chatbot is making it impossible to talk to a human or hand in a claim, you just go in circles with it offering you useless options. The positives were that if it was other AirAsia flights that were affected by these cancellations it was pretty painless to move them around and most of the flights were punctual.",1,0.9989745616912842,1

At the time, they started calling for all passengers to check in their luggage for our flight, we arrived at the counter and my sister in law showed her our pre check in confirmation email. It was an overwhelming experience to our family. The policies and procedure were never clear.

I, personally have traveled on numerous different airlines and never have I noticed so much unprofessionalism. And such a disappointment to most of my family members which was their first time ever being on a plane.

AirAsia has no customer service, no customer service phone number, not even an email address. All they have is an online chatbot named AVA, which is worse than useless.

We were automatically rebooked on flights - one of which was an entire day later than our initial itinerary. We couldn't miss the day of work, so attempted to get a refund or credit for that fllight. Absolutely no ability to contact a human, and everything was done through the chat bot - except that the bot was obviously incapable of understanding the situation. We explicitly said we needed a refund for one flight. In the meantime, we booked quickly with another airline (at substantial out of pocket cost). Instead? No refund, but they credited both flights which meant that we now no longer had any route to our destination! We also can't rebook the original AirAsia flight because the price has quadrupled. Absolutely no customer service or assistance. We are left with three lots of flights we can't use, a substantial amount of out of pocket cost, and no apology.",1,0.999173104763031,1

They have no interest in attempting to retain a customer in any way shape or form, the default answer is no.

I hoped I could get some kind of credit for booking another flight but they were unwilling to consider the option, which is certainly their right for the fare booked.

Second, some of their practices are very dubious. When I booked my flight, it was written ""check bag included"". But when I printed the ticket, I discovered it wasn't and the employee fined me for my luggage (more than 200 USD) because according to the company, it wasn't ""included"". Actually, when I ordered on their platform, the luggage were included, but the ticket they sent me didn't correspond to reality. I met other travelers when I was queuing up who had the same problem and were fined as well. (No refund/no exchange is possible).

I've been doing this for the past week. Looks like there are many in the same boat here. My only concern is if i cant get my refund processed before my flight date which is on the 23rd April.

2023,"We arrived at the Bohol-Panglao Airport 2.5 hours prior to departure. The check in counter had 5 lanes open, and about 15 groups ahead of us. We did the online check in, and used the kiosk to print our bag tags. Did this save us any time? No.  We had to wait in the check in line for over an hour waiting on other passengers to adjust their bags to avoid paying extra baggage fees - if it was one group I would understand, but it was every single one of them, and the gate agents did nothing about this. Instead they played on facebook. When it is finally our turn the gate agent says we did the bag tags wrong and re does them the same way I did. He sends the first 2 bags to be loaded and continues to the next 2 bags. On the second 2 bags he puts a transfer ticket on them without telling us that he forgot to on the first 2 bags. We noticed it but he didn't think we did. After going thru security, we talked about it and came to the conclusion that we needed to talk to someone. We couldn't afford for these bags to be delayed so we asked the security agent who we should talk to. He directs us to go back thru security and talk to the supervisor. We asked 2 people for a manager, they refused to get a manager and offered to help themselves. When we expressed our concern they offered to check our bags and they went to the sorting area and came back stating that our bags have already been sealed and cannot be checked. We then went to a security manager to express our concern and we were able to finally talk to the desk manage. He told us he could pull the bags to check, but I'd he did, they will probably not make the flight.  We arrive to Manila and departed the plane and took a bus to terminal 3. We noticed that many passengers were not getting off the plane so we asked a stewardess if this bus was for transfers and she said yes, so we proceeded. We arrived on the bus in terminal 3 at the baggage claim and needed to be at terminal 4. Confused and short on time to catch our connecting flight we found the transfer desk after having to ask for directions. The agent at the counter didn't look up from her phone until we started filming and threatening to put the video on social media. Only then did she show us where the transfer bus was. We get to another agent at the bus transfer depot and he informed us that the bus had just departed and it would be at least 30 minutes till the next one, and by then we would miss our boarding cut off. He first tells us that we need to exit the terminal and take a cab. We asked if there is another option, because we really don't have time to go back thru security. He informed us that Cebu Pacific has a private shuttle they can call and that I need to go back to the transfer desk to make the request. I get back and the agent we spoke to before agreed to call this transfer. After about 15 minutes the shuttle arrived . We were then told that the shuttle does not have permission to take us thru the airport to get us to the other terminal, and we would have to exit the airport and drive around. We arrive at terminal 4 and still have to go thru security. We arrived 5 minutes before our scheduled departure time. when we arrived at terminal 4 we found out that our plane was delayed by 30 minutes, so the stress.",1,0.9972845315933228,1

2023,"I flew 3 routes with Cebu Pacific Hanoi to Manila and Manila to Caticlan v.v. The hard product is fairly standard for an Asian low cost airline. A well kept A321/320 with a tight seat pitch and no recline and a decent crew. What makes it quite an adventure is their passengers. Any flight I took with this airline started and ended in a chaos. People dragging way too much luggage into the cabin, people seemingly clueless where their seat is while blocking the aisle and frustrating the boarding process. The crew is helpless, but tries to keep cool. While preparing the cabin for departure several people start using the toilets meaning that during taxiing people are in the aisles. The flights are uneventful, although the last landing at MNL was quite rough. All in all not bad for the price paid, but an experience. When Cebu Pacific would pay more attention to their own cabin luggage criteria it would be much smoother.

MNL-MEL ontime, boarding - there is no process really apart from the Elders and Adults with child boarding 1st. Again same type of aircraft, Middle toilets were not working and they have to attached plastic liners for passengers to throw their rubbish, very unsanitary.

To make matters worse, they made the compensation process a convoluted and frustrating ordeal, and to this day, I've received no compensation. Their customer service is shockingly bad, and it feels like they want customers to give up and accept their negligence.

I tried to look for a customer service number and called several of them but all of them throughout the world are automated answering services. So I had no choice but to purchase a second ticket. My fiance explained the situation to the ticket agent at the airport and the agent said no problem you can just go to the customer service office and get it fixed. The only problem, the customer service office was closed! And when I disputed the charge with my credit card company, Cebu Pacific managed to twist this whole thing around and state I have no rights to a refund due to their ""No Cancellation Policy"" We will never fly this airline again!

2023,"I thought I knew what I was buying, a ticket for a very reasonable price - especially with carry-on only - on a low-cost airline, so I didn't really have expectations. However, this was my first time travelling long-distance on such an airline and not the usual max. 2-hr flights. And this made a huge difference. My seat was 4J, in the front, by the window, close to the toilet, but not too close. This was all fine. But an 8+ hr long flight with 7 restrooms only, for 436 seats, probably not enough. The quality of the seats, the restrooms were so worn-off and broken that I didn't really feel comfortable (though I'm not picky at all, but the restroom was a real experience towards the end of the flight). No entertainment (TV or music), of course, seats are not too comfortable either, but at least you can order food on board. Pretty limited selection in food unless you pre-order (strongly advised), drinks, snacks...but as it happened in my case, only 2 machines to pay by card, in my case BOTH broken. No local peso with me (why, if I'm flying out), and no USD (why, if I'm European, travelling home). Since we figured this out after my order of coffee, after a little while, I was told, it was on the company, but a few hours later I was thirsty and hungry, so I asked about opportunities to get a noodle pack and water. Since they said the company likely won't allow it, the flight attendants shared their own meal pack with me (noodle pack) and I got from their water. Interesting approach from the airline, but a huge thanks to the crew. Only a question, how come nobody checked the machines before taking off? (I flew with Cebu from Saigon to Manila before, short enough flight, so on shorter distance, I would probably take them again, but I would suggest / consider other options for 3+ hr flights).",0,0.9944832921028137,1

How does that make any sense?! Even though the airport is small and security/check in takes like 5 minutes - with the gates right there, apparently we were too late. Why give us the option to change our flight time on YOUR website and then not able to accommodate to us? We were told that we had no other option but to rebook another flight which cost 19,000 pesos in cash because they said they didnt accept card. We didnt have that much cash on us but luckily our friends who were with us lend us some.  I had asked if they were able to reimburse if not all, some of that money back, considering we paid lots & lots of $$$ and all they said was no, sorry.",1,0.9989689588546753,1

They cancelled that and gave us a halt at Philippines for 18 hours. - Initially when we asked at our check in counter in Bali about this they said, sorry we cannot do anything as Cebu pacific doesnt have any office or personal there. - There was no easy way to get in touch with them that, we even tried the Facebook messenger which was completely managed by the bot and not helpful at all. - Once we arrived at the Philippines airport, the staff of Cebu pacific had made us wait at the transfer desk for almost 1.5 hours and then they just left to hide from the other passengers in distress. - As per the immigration rules many passengers couldnt exit and were stuck in the airport for 18 hours. - They tried offering us compensation after repeated complaining from our end, After making us wait for 2 hours additional We could see it was a ruse as they offered us 3 hotels. Out of which two of them were 2 star hotel and one of them was a 2.5 star and extremely far from the airport. Crisis management was extremely weak, we were given statements such as you took the flight from Bali to Philippines , that means you accepted our conditions , You can take your own hotel , You can post whatever you like etc. in short, they did not care about the passengers concerns, wellbeing or comfort they just wanted to do escape from the situation.",1,0.9996225833892822,1

All of us have the responsibility and self discipline to be punctual and be answerable for our own actions. The fact that the Singapore flight check in have to be side-lined, then who would want to come on time for check in? The later you come, the earlier you get to check in. Seeing many passengers who are in the same predicament as me, I decided to shame Cebu Pacific. Their senior customer service instead of apologizing, cited that Narita boarding gate is closing soon. Is this my problem? We are not talking about a few passengers whom we need to give way. 30 passengers! For what? When Cebu Pacific promote people to manage the counters, its really by seniority and not by brains. Why dont they split the counters to accommodate for both routes?

Also during boarding they are messy and create problems out of nowhere, for example while checking the boarding pass before boarding they tell me my name is incorrect and I need to go and change it ASAP, but actually no, they just don't really know how to read, and all of them look a bit oblivious of what's going on at all times.",1,0.9996046423912048,1

Very little update or info from cabin crew and cockpit communications very limited or non-existent particularly over a duration of 8 hour flight. Right hand front toilet consistently with a queue of 3 to 8 people. I then found out that the left hand front toilet cabin staff were saying it was not in use despite a green light showing. Then when i pushed the matter they admitted that it was reserved for the Captain only. Absolutely unbelievable! The one working right front toilet was a total disgrace, absolutely filthy with no toilet tissue and contaminated water swilling on the floor. During turbulence announcements cabin crew took no action at all to ask the queue for the toilet to return to their seats despite they themselves strapped in ( a major safety issue!). Not even one pot of noodles available during flight and not even any hot drinks at all. Pre ordered food choices were not available and PAX fobbed off with other alternatives of which the quality was lousy. Generally the cabin crew were inattentive and spend a lot of time just sitting down. No pro active action to do more than the very basic.

2022,"The Cebu Pacific website disconnects, times out, and stops loading a lot. I think they just didn't set it up to handle online traffic very well. It disrupted my booking constantly and worse, didn't process my payment properly so the booking was not confirmed, yet I was charged on my credit card. Their customer service is a Facebook chat and the staff are unfortunately not even trusted by their company with anything to do with my account so not very much help at all when I had to open a dispute on the charge since they never fixed that charge (to this day, months later and I had to book a second time, still unresolved and waiting for dispute case). The customer service help desk shouldn't be a Facebook chat - should be an actual phone line and their staff should be trained on account matters. Also their website currently is confusing with an ""old"" and ""new"" version for when you want to manage your booking. Certain options can only be done on either versions. The mobile app doesn't work at all. Always has an error. On the actual flight: the NRT>MNL plane does not have reclining seats and they do offer meals but you have to buy them. So if you are going to be hungry, eat before your board. While they were serving the snacks, I normally am okay and indifferent to the smell of instant noodles but somehow on that flight, it was just overpowering since we're in an enclosed space. After some time and just before our stomachs were going to turn inside out, thankfully the staff sprayed something in the air that eliminated the odor but I think serving such a strong smelling food is not good for flights in my opinion. The only thing I think that I can say is positive is that their check-in staff and cabin attendants were professional the entire time. I get they are a budget airline and for prices to be cheap, you compromise a lot on things but I think Cebu Pacific doesn't even meet the basic standards that other budget airlines do.

My connecting flight, which was supposed to depart at 04.55, was delayed until 10.10 am (without explanation). The airline bought one free McDonald's meal for every customer, but in my opinion, that did not make up for a 5 hour delay. 2. When I made my booking, it was made clear that there would be no food available on the flight. However, once on the flight, I noticed that other passengers had been able to pre-book meals. It would have been nice if this option were available to me to - would have saved me from having to buy food at ridiculous prices in Dubai airport. 3. I understand that this is a budget airline, but the low cost is not worth the discomfort. The seats are tiny and do not recline. There is no inflight entertainment. This flight was almost 10 hours long and it was incredibly uncomfortable. The restrooms were dirty and smelled bad. 4. When we landed in Manila, the captain announced that because of the red thunder, there would be a slight delay in de-boarding. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the terminal we were supposed to use for de-boarding was occupied by another airline because of the disruption of the thunderstorm. He said we would wait for 10-15 minutes. This went on for two hours, with him periodically announcing that it would only be another 10-15 minutes. After the 6 hour delay and almost 10 hour flight, this pushed me past my breaking point. The pilot said it was beyond their control.

A friend is going home to the Philippines she is happy to use the fund BUT NO - the original booker MUST be part of the booking and on the flight? Because they just want to take your money. You can't talk with a person only a useless BOT. When you do get an email from a real life person your reply goes to a general mailbox and no one ever reads it.

2022,Its my first time flying after over a year. Flight booking for Cebu Pacific is convenient although I don't like their current 32kg - 1pc baggage allowance. Airport check in was fast and crew were efficient and helpful - I checked in a few minutes before closing and they are very helpful. The plane was late and we waited a few more minutes to board. Boarding was okay as per the current pandemic state and the gate personnel are very keen to remind passengers of safety protocols. Aircraft was clean upon boarding. Staff are helpful with the baggage. Flight was smooth until landing. Deplaning via bus gates are the worst at Manila. Baggage claim was quick and no damage to my bags,0,0.20316345989704132,0

Ten minutes later, they said that the Filipino government wont let any plane coming from China to the Philippines. Still, I want to go to China, I am not coming from there. So, what does it have to do with me again? Afterwards, they told me that every company in the Philippines are forbidden to go to China, Hong Kong and Macau.

They wouldnt tell me what was happening and what I could do. I was anxious because the day after I had a flight from Macau to Taipei and from Taipei to Paris. I needed to go to Macau as fast as possible. I was sitting on the floor, hungry, tired and scared of the people of Cebu Airlines. They talked to me, as if they were talking to a dog.

Not only was there a complete lack of communication about the delay and the subsequent impact on connecting flights, but the airline failed to provide any assistance or support.  It's clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this airline,",1,0.9997902512550354,1
2023,"Traveling with IndiGo on our recent family trip from HYD to DFW via DOH proved to be a frustrating experience that left us feeling helpless and disappointed. During our check-in at HYD, IndiGo's system was down, leading to 7 out of our 13 total checked-in bags being manually tagged. Though we understood that technical issues can happen, what followed was a series of missteps. Upon arrival at DFW, we discovered that all 7 manually tagged bags were missing. The Qatar Airways team at DFW had no information about these manually generated tags, leaving us stranded without vital belongings. We called IndiGo's customer care 9 times over three days, and each time, the response was the same: unable to reach the Hyderabad crew, and no managers on the call center floor to escalate our issue. The lack of responsiveness and the inability to locate our bags with crucial manual tags felt like a major oversight. What added to our frustration was that 5 of the 7 manual tags were taken back by the IndiGo team when their system came back online, leaving us without any physical proof. Polite customer care representatives, though unable to assist. Failure in handling manual tag situation during system downtime. While we appreciate that technical issues can occur, it's the handling of such problems that defines a company's reputation.",1,0.9996364116668701,1
2023,"The last leg of my connection was Chandigarh to Dubai. I was sat in 4D aisle. Through more than 2 hours of the journey my seat was being kicked and punched from seat 5D just behind me by a child. I complained twice and nothing happened. I asked to see the cabin supervisor and was told she was busy eating. I explained the situation to another crew member and they cautioned the Pax on seat 5D (the mother of the child) to be more decent. Finally after the third call, the family themselves moved the child to seat 4B the middle seat on the other side. At this phase of flight the captain had flashed the fasten seat belt as there was turbulence. To my shock the father of the child sat on 5C made the child stand up on the tray table of seat 4b and play with the overhead fittings including the light, the call button, the oxygen mask compartment and others. I am astonished that such risky and terrible behaviour from the parents of the child was tolerated by the crew and also that the leading lady as they are called simply refused to attend the issue. I am calling to accountability the cabin supervisor and asking Indigo to prevent the tray table from bring used as a play area. Indigo crew looks poorly trained on safety.",1,0.9982858300209045,1

Usually in Indian aircraft that travel to and from the Middle East, the flight attendants' service is quite bad. Here, though Indigo is a budget airline, the service is similar to that of a premium airline. The only thing they can improve is that, usually in Middle Eastern flights which travel to Kerala, they give announcements in Arabic, English and Malayalam but in Indigo and other Indian aircrafts, they give the announcement in English and Hindi.

Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first. For ""Indigo"" Airlines, this is not the case will ""dump"" people onto the Bus and transport them from Gate to the Aircraft. In-Flight: Seating is congested, just like Auto-Rickshaw. The cabin crew is courteous and helpful. Landing: 30 Minutes late from their scheduled arrival. As a result, we had to spend another 30 Minutes at the HYD Airport for Immigration Officers' shift rotation. Overall DOH-HYD Experience is just a dump yard ride for me in Indigo Airlines. The journey from HYD to DOH, concerns starts with Check-In until the Landing. Nonetheless, this part of the journey is the most ""Interesting"" part of this review, don't miss it. Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code. Reached the Airport 4 hours before departure, Kids in arms and eight bags to check-in (opted porter service), had to stay in line for 1 hour 25 minutes to approach the check-in counter after repeated requests to follow the check-in code. Finally, at the check-in counter, the indigo staff was inclined to charge me 15k INR extra as my three bags had 1 kg extra and other bags had less than 23 kg allowed. Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight.

2022,"So, I tried to heed the many warnings that I saw in this airline's terrible reviews regarding their baggage Scam policy. I recently had a flight from Mumbai to Maldives, for which the ticket fare was $159 for a one-way ticket. Still a little pricey, but not bad. The only reason why I took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the Maldives. After booking the ticket, I noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED.

2022,"Indigo was utterly careless in handing a sensitive item like infant / baby child restraint system (CRS) and caused damage even after we safely handed it to them at the gate.  The bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination. The bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly. We use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues.  It is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k INR due to Indigo's shoddy handling. We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later. We later found out that leaving the airport without PIR means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold Indigo liable anymore.

However, in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and I felt compelled to warn other travellers. Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport.

Their website had a problem then why should I suffer for it, hence I requested a full refund for which they are not willing to give. I called them and after talking to their customer service for 01 hour or more, she would not give a full refund, neither solve the issue nor let me speak to her manager and wanted me to book for another date. From her I understood that the 04 Jan 22 flight was cancelled and they rescheduled the 05 Jan 22 flight, which I did not want due to the change in timing and fly with another airline as I have to reach on 05 Jan 22 early morning. These guys go by On Time departure and Arrival but none of that is true. So all of you be beware and customer service has a few lines which they repeat for every question and it really annoys you as this is not the right reply in English for a question asked.

2021,"On the return flight from Indore, the check-in of the luggage was done very swiftly as we reached the airport well ahead of departure. The boarding also started well on time. One thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions. Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future. The rating is given based on the safety violation of not stowing away the cabin bags under the seat during takeoff but apart from that the flight and crew were really good.",0,0.03821658715605736,0

At Bangalore airport, there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues. Also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes, one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access. This is also something I experienced first hand and was very valuable. The boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking, one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage. I selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time. The food was pretty decent along with the tea. Staff service was prompt and polite.

This was not enough for the airline, they wanted a direct flight back. We again made our travel agent rebook, while we didn't cancel our flight to Bahrain, since we didn't trust the totally misinformed Indigo staff, we travelled, spent days in the Maldives and travelled to Bahrain without any hassles! We checked and rechecked with Male airport as well, no such rule was there! Wrong information besides being totally un cooperative towards customers, we are very disappointed with the airline, especially as I have never experienced this.

Before boarding all passengers were given a Safety Kit packet which included a face shield,face mask and 5-6 pouches of hand Sanitizers, also the best thing was that all the middle seat passengers were also made to wear the safety gown along with the face mask and face shield which is a good safety measure. The inflight magazine wasn't available but understandable as they are trying to minimize the contact as much as possible. Water bottles were free of cost even though pre-covid IndiGo used to serve water in cups but it's nice they are serving water bottles free of cost and also in addition to that they are served free tea and coffee as well.

The airline claimed that the flight was cancelled due to Covid restrictions but is clear that the flight was cancelled due to lack of good loads and so instead of the usual travel time of 2.5 hours the total flight duration was almost 6 hours which could have been better. At least during the online check-in the airline didn't charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief.

The Jetstar rep stated I would now have to speak to qantas as I was now on a qantas flight. I called Qantas who changed me to a flight early the next morning. I was required to stay in Sydney and as per the email I received from Jetstar stating my expenses would be covered. The next morning I made the request with Jetstar regarding my expenses. Jetstar stated that as I didnt make the earlier flight they had changed me onto they would not be covering my expenses.

Evening snack was a Ham & Cheese toastie, not bad, nice and hot, with a hot chocolate drink, for $12, pretty much what you'd pay in a Melbourne high street cafe, or less. An hour out of Melbourne I was given a chocolate cake and a coffee, the cake was moist, again at $6 pretty good value. The cabin was quiet, the crew was attentive, coming around regularly offering glasses of water. One of those low key professional cabin crews going about their business. Arrived at about 10:10.

She charged us AUD 75 and she kept saying it is non compliant. After charging AUD 75, we still took the same bag with same weight in the carry on baggage.  Their service is pretty bad. We paid $40 before to upgrade our luggage and their team member gave us the wrong advice and we had to pay for that. They dont take any responsibility of their behaviour towards the customer.

Jetstar Business class allowed you to board first, just like any airline would. You got bigger seats with a lot more room, though the seats were uncomfortable. We were offered a glass of sparkling wine that tasted like petrol with added co2. At 11.30 at night, the choice of meals were potato gnocchi or a cold chicken salad, a small very sweet cake, but a nice roll and butter. We both asked for a beer and were left somewhat bemused by what can only be described as a 150ml glass of beer each. Breakfast was nothing to write home about, nice roll and butter though. All in all, we had a more relaxing flight on the out bound economy flight. The service was better and the food was a lot better, and I managed to have a beer all to myself.

2023,Absolutely appalling experience with Jetstar. Our flights were booked well in advance. We arrived over 2 hours before our flight to be told they have oversold the plane (which they assured us in common practice). We are a group of 3 and the counter staff told us they could accommodate 1 person on the flight and the other would have to fly the following day. Given everyone had children at home and had businesses to run this was not an options. The second solution was to fly to an airport 3 hours from the destination. This was also not an option. The final solution was to fly to an airport 2 hours away later that evening. We asked to speak to a Manager. The staff gave out and told us that they had overbooked flights the previous day and given away our seats to other customers. When we questioned her she shoved her hands in our face and said Im not dealing with this and walked away. No customer service whatsoever and left the junior counter staff to deal with the situation. As jetstar had given away our booked and paid for seats we agreed to 1 person flying on the original flight and the other 2 taking the alternative flyer and being out of pocket for a 2 hour Uber. Then after further delay we were informed they had again made an error and we had now lost our 1 original seat we had been promised. We asked to speak to a manager and out came manager. We thought customer service has bad before she has appalling and extremely rude. She refused to listen and spoke over the top of us. We asked why they didnt give us a courtesy call and she said if its under 2 hours they dont have to and deal with it at the airport. We were there before 2 hours to self check in so this was a lie. She offered to cancel our flights (refund in 14 days) knowing full well that no other airlines had available flights that day. We asked why our seats where given away and we got contradicting answers She really could not care less and was extremely rude.

2023,"Flying with Jetstar felt like being part of a special performance where the crew believed they were doing passengers a colossal favor. From the relentless PA announcements about how the crew should be treated, you'd think we were aboard a magical unicorn, not a plane. I get it, some passengers can be a handful, but did we really need to hear the ""be kind to your crew"" mantra four times during the flight? Speaking of the crew, they might want to consider that their primary role is to assist passengers. I asked for a glass of bottled water to take my heart medication. Her response? ""I can't help you, but you can pay $4.00 or drink tap water."" It wasn't about the four bucks; it was about the complete lack of empathy and urgency, especially when I explained that tap water wasn't an option due to my medical condition. Sure, I'd bring my own water onboard if I could, but thanks to Australian regulations, that's a no-go. For medical reasons, the crew should consider making exceptions or providing assistance.  The crew's customer service skills and smiles were about as rare as a blue moon. Upon landing in Sydney, the baggage ordeal was a two-hour-long spectacle. No announcements, no apologies. They even managed to announce the wrong baggage belt twice before passengers had to play detective to locate their belongings. It was absolute chaos  more circus than a well-oiled operation. The only reason I'm being generous with a 1 and not a 0 is because the aircraft did land safely.

Our flight from Syd to Melb was actually good. We flew with kid (not infant, 2 yo paid ticket) and we brought a foldable cabin size pram with no bag, so it couldn't go into the cabin and must be given to the staff at the gate, free of charge. Which is common on most airlines. The ground staffs in Sydney were friendly. But the flight back from Melbourne to Sydney was a nightmare. The flight delayed for hours, after our original flight was canceled a day before. We were not allowed to check the pram in at the gate. The ground staffs weighed all of our carry-on luggages at the gate, including the pram. So the pram was counted and it caused us to exceed the cabin weight limit. We complained because the pram was not an issue on our previous flight. It's weird and unreasonable because how come the rules in Sydney and Melb are different. But the staff did not accept the complaint and gave us 2 non-negotiable options. 1. Pay the extra charge (double from the normal price) or 2. If we are not willing to pay the charge, they will move us to the next flight for us to checked in the pram but it will cost us more money. We often travel with kids and never have a disappointing experience like this. It was obvious they want to upsell us so bad. We feel scammed. Some staff were rude and arrogant. The way they talked to us from the beginning was disrespectful and intimidating. And one of them kept complaining about our not-so-loud kids.

Often they would wait until 15 minutes after the plane was supposed to take off, Leaving us sitting in the departure terminal not knowing what to do. These corrupts idiots had the nerve to tell everyone, in well publicised media releases, to turn up 45 minutes earlier for their flights to improve reliability and punctuality, transferring the blame to customers. Now they make us wait 4 hours repeatedly, forcing us to wait hours in airports, missing connecting flights, missing plans weve made on the other end, costing no end of inconvenience. And they decide were the ones to blame. Id happily pay 200 per cent more to fly with anyone other than jetstar. They are deliberately under staffing to save costs, failing to admit their faults, and disingenuously suggesting its customers that cause their reputation for unreliability. Insane. Dont buy it, pay more and get more of your holiday back.",1,0.9995228052139282,1
2023,"We were incredibly frustrated and disappointed when our flight experienced a delay of more than three hours. It seemed absolutely ludicrous considering the plans we had in Auckland, where we had important people to meet and a car to pick up before the rental company closed its doors for the day. This unforeseen delay not only threw off our schedule but also added unnecessary stress and uncertainty to our trip. We had meticulously planned our arrival time to ensure a seamless transition, but now we were left scrambling to rearrange our plans and salvage what we could from the situation. It's disheartening when a mere delay has such a significant impact on our travel plans, especially when there are time-sensitive commitments waiting at our destination.",1,0.9983141422271729,1

A few minutes after gathering at the airport the flight was cancelled due to the route being given up for a route to Melbourne instead for a popular AFL game. This meant that my group had to be split up in half with half going to Brisbane and half going to Melbourne in order to connect back to Cairns. After myself and a few others flew to Brisbane, we found out that yet again our connecting flight to Cairns was cancelled and we had to wait a day after for a new flight to emerge to Cairns.

2023,Horrible experience with Jetstar airways. I was in a previous flight from Saporro to Narita which arrive at 19:10. Had to run to pick up my luggage which was slow to come out and transfer on their airport shuttle to a different terminal. I arrived 10mins late despite rushing from my last flight and the check in counter people would not let me through. The flight was meant to depart at 20:50 and I had arrived at 20:00. I said I had 50mins left but that did not matter. This has affected my 2 flights from Narita to Gold Coast and Gold Coast to Sydney. The late fee was stated to be about $1200 plus. How ridiculous is that! And unreasonable. I refuse to take this airline again. I booked with another airline at $528 (which is half the processing fee of Jetstar!),1,0.9993366599082947,1

Jetstar could not able to provide an evidence that I was not logged in and advised cannot refund the difference.  I was on the phone for an hour and chatted to explain that since I a club JetStar member than you should be able to adjust the fund by marrying up my ticket details with my account. I have never experienced such a bad customer service from JetStar in past and from any other Australian company. I paid $55 membership and JetStar decided to argue with me for an hour just to take $100 from me by ruining the reputation and not caring for its loyal customer.  Even an idiot can understand that one member purchased tickets and missed the discount which she is entitle for to give it other. This kind of business model may be good for short term but in the long run it will lose its capability and will be out of the market. No concept of goodwill gesture for loyal customer.

Although it was heart breaking to miss a whole day of being in Australia since we were only going for the weekend for a wedding. We were grateful that we were able to be scheduled on a night flight via JetStar the same day. However, this review is to provide feedback on the staff that was on duty to provide other options for us customers whose flight were delayed that morning. It was a long que and everyone were waiting patiently despite the lack of sleep and change of plans. It was disappointing to view that the staff kept on cutting corners in serving his own people in which we witnessed a total of three (not travelling together) before we got served. None of these customers stood in the que and walked straight to the desk and chatted with the staff in their own language. Fed up, another had walked to the counter just when we got there and one of us told him to go to the back of the line in which the staff stated that we needed to calm down and threatened us with calling security. We left it as it is because we were desperate to get on a flight that day as we did not want to miss the wedding altogether.

2023,"I would like to share our recent experience with JetStar airlines and advise you to reconsider traveling with them, especially if you are traveling with young children. Our flight was delayed in Phuket for 40 hours with 6 time changes, which caused a lot of inconvenience and frustration. We were removed from the plane at 11:30 pm and were taken to a hotel provided by JetStar. We had a 5-month-old baby with us, but unfortunately when we arrived around 1:30am, the hotel did not have any safe sleeping conditions for our child, including a cot. Despite repeated requests, we were denied any proper sleeping arrangements for our child, which made our situation even more difficult. We were unable to book another hotel as we were told that our flight would be delayed for only 8 hours, which kept getting pushed due to issues that were entirely in JetStar's control. Moreover, we found that the information provided on the JetStar website or at the airport was entirely contradictory to the information we received when we spoke to someone online. This caused even more confusion and frustration during our long and tiring ordeal. We strongly advise parents against traveling with JetStar, especially if you are traveling with young children. Our experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and we would not want any other family to go through the same ordeal.",1,0.9987800717353821,1

I called Jetstar and had it changed back, but then when we went to check in at the airport, they had given our seats to someone else! So not only did we not get the seats we paid for, we also didn't get to sit together! On the flight, the key issues include extremely hard and uncomfortable seats, very little to no legroom, no inflight entertainment, the worst food I have ever had the misfortune of eating, and an absolutely full plane. It is still a 6.5 hour flight, so some comfort would be welcomed! There isn't even a business class option or premium economy.

But it was the Easter long weekend there were no other flights available until the next day. It took us an hour to get our bag back, and we lost a day of our Easter break. On the following day the automatic check-in was quick and easy. Service from the ground and cabin staff was good. The plane operated 40 mins late. It would have been sensible to leave passengers in the public area of the main terminal for that time, so they could get food and go to the toilet. But Jetstar called us all down to the already crowded departure area, to spend the time milling about and trying to work out if there was a queue. Seats were comfortable if basic. The airline's take-on bag policy was not enforced -- the cabin crew were imploring passengers who had done the right thing to put their bags under the seat in front of them, in order to make room in the overhead racks for the suitcase-size bags that the airline had allowed on board.",1,0.37456899881362915,0

2023,"They cancelled my flight JQ28 on the 5th of April from Phuket to Sydney (apparently the 3rd flight in 3 days) then kept us at the airport for almost 4 hours without food or drink whilst we had to wait for hotels to be arranged. Then they lied as we were told the hotel was close to the airport when in fact it was 25km away as I noticed when we were on the bus the driver drove past the area where they told us the hotel was so I asked him where he was going to which he replied ""Phuket town"". If I knew that before I could have gone to my home in Phuket instead and save myself a lot of time. But because they said it was close to the airport I figured there was no point going home. We got there around 3am and aircons blew hot air then got told we would be picked up at 1pm to go to the airport even know the hotel manager stated a late check out was totally fine. We got to the airport before 2pm and check in didn't open until 0340pm and i got told by check in staff the flight might be cancelled again as there were not enough first aid supplies on board and they needed to be flown in. At check in we got a 300baht voucher which was only valid at burger king where meals start around 500baht. The flight got further delayed because aircraft was not ready yet. So I missed a whole day of precious family time whom I hadn't seen for 7.5 years plus spent a lot of money on overpriced airport priced food and drinks. The crew was nice put the plane was dirty as hell. Dust everywhere, drink marks etc. When we landed in Sydney they parked us on a remote stand near cargo and we couldn't disembark because the AFP had to come onboard. After that there were no busses available as Qantas parked an A380 on the bay next to us and those passenger had to be disembarked by bus too. Once through customs I went hunting for Jetstar Australia customer service. A very rude agent told me to go to the office on the 3rd floor, when I got there in was closed and dark. I went back down and asked her why she sent me to a closed office. Then some ladies with Jetstar uniforms where there but apparently they worked for Swissport. The supervisor seemed very cold and had lack of empathy and tried to brush me off and was very condescending. She told me to go online and contact Jetstar or call the call center but then said call center might be a waste of time (really?) I am not gonna let this go. I will be pushing for compensation!

For me, it's a sign of disinterest and complete arrogance. Sad really that they hold their client base in such disregard and contempt.

Seat comfort was okay, but it could have been comfier. Food and beverage was good, but it would be better if they separate the dessert time. Not put at the same tray on main course. This could provide better enjoyment as it is served together with tea and coffee. In addition, the appetizer was disappointing as it was only served a pack of pretzel instead of proper meal.

There are a dozen other passengers standing here as well all saying its happened to them so many times with many delays ending up in cancelations after waiting the 3 or 4 hours on the Melbourne to Hobart service. Our experience of delays and cancellations has been Jetstar Australia-wide and Jetstar international. Ground staff are rude and unwilling to help - if you can find a service desk that is even open.

When you get to the airport, they say you cannot check bags or must pay $25 per kg! What? I've never heard of such a policy. After some haggling (while worrying we'd miss the flight entirely during this lengthy process) we got the price to $225 for both of our bags, which is still far steeper than the $105 it was supposed to cost (again usually international bags on most airlines are free). We did pay $800 for a ticket after all. Then, on board, you cannot even get water, soft drinks, or coffee without paying a fee. Nothing is free. Plane is cramped.

I sat in seat 1A and the seat was reasonably comfortable. After take-off, the flight proceeded normally. The food served on board the plane was bad as I expected. The flight was turbulent, but the staff handled it very well. On the flight back, they informed us that 27 pieces of baggage were not on the plane. That we don't have to worry about our baggage. I checked in 2 pieces of luggage and both were lost. I dealt with the situation at the airport in Auckland, because I flew back to Vienna on January 10, 2023. One piece of my luggage was returned to me after 42 days  damaged and I had to pick it up at the Vienna airport. Everything was soaked and moldy as if it had been soaked in water for a long time. Communication with customer service is complicated and without real answers. In the e-mails, they claimed to have found the luggage and asked for the delivery address.

Later postponed again with no notification (found out from our relatives who checked their status page for us). Went from leaving at 9.30pm to 12.30am to 5.30am (check in at 2.30am). So we booked a hotel and rushed to the airport so we could check in so early the next day. Flight cancelled just as we checked into the airport hotel. They refunded the hotel, but there is no compensation for stress, running around, etc. of course. We changed to the flight leaving 9.30pm next day and fortunately this one took off. But late, and not before 90 minutes standing in check-in line (despite being early) because they only had one economy checkin counter open. Staff is abrasive, curt, unfriendly, both on the ground and in-flight. At the other end the wait for our bags was over an hour. My advice - if you travel with Jetstar you're doing it at your own risk. I would advise anyone to take a longer route to get to their destination by choosing any other airline.

We flew into Auckland Airport, New Zealand on 3.12.22 with the intention to cycle tour around this beautiful country. Unfortunately our hold boxes containing our bicycles and everything else except our hand luggage, did not arrive at the same time. We were left with no option but to hire a car to get to our prepaid accommodation some 60km away. For 4 days we rang and emailed Jetstar. On each occasion we were told that they were still trying to locate our luggage. We were promised on numerous occasions that someone would call us back to give us an update. Annoyingly no call was ever received. With our travel plans totally disrupted, out of sheer frustration, we drove back to Auckland airport to discuss the matter face to face with the lost/delayed baggage department. After queuing for an hour with our angry folk trying to locate their luggage, we finally got to see someone. Eventually, they actually found our boxes whilst we waited. There must of been at least another 6 bike boxes in the lost luggage hall along with literally hundreds of suitcases. Who knows how long we would have been waiting for Jetstar to advise us that they actually had our luggage at Auckland airport. Days possibly weeks we suspect. Ours, is sadly not an isolated incident. Since then, we have sent email after email trying to recover the unbudgeted car hire costs we were forced to spend due to Jetstars inabilities. Jetstar flatly refuse to refund us these costs and insist that they will only cover the costs of the emergency toothpaste and brush we had to purchase.

This wouldnt have been a big deal, but the woman at the front desk was incredibly rude and told us the baggage was a safety hazard and wouldnt fit in the overhead luggage compartment. However, once we paid the 65 dollars, no one took our luggage and they just told us to bring it with us on the plane. Low and behold, our bags fit just fine, in the recommended position. They have standard baggage compartments that fit our standard bags just fine. And if there was any safety hazard, they bypassed it by having us board with our luggage anyway. Its just a stupid scam for money, and it was a confusing process to be lied to until we payed and then have everything magically be fine. Ive never experienced an issue with my bag size or weight ever before with any other airline, and I travel frequently. The flying experience was also horrible.

We had additional luggage included and it was more than enough for our needs. Welcomed on board with a glass of bubbles/fruit juice choice and packet of nibbles. Seats A1 and A2. Also got a small but useful comfort kit that included a blow up neck pillow, light blanket, eye shade, socks and lip balm.  Comfortable seats with good recline. Being A1 and A2 we had loads of room in front. The foot rest though was poor and cut across the back of the calves. Using my backpack was much better and others in our cabin seemed to be doing the same. The seat and footrest settings were stiff and difficult to use but staff arrived immediately and fixed this. The staff were excellent. We received a menu and a staff member discussed it with us and took our choices. Main meal and breakfast. Main meal. main course was gnocchi. To dry and the balls were too hard. It needed a more liquid sauce. Came with a choice of reasonable quality red and white wines. Other snacks and wines available during the flight if required. Breakfast was quite good with a range of choices and decent coffee. Not up to regular business class meals but considerably better than economy flights. Again, we were happy considering the price.

I had vouchers to use but Jetstar made it so difficult and complicated to redeem them that I had to eventually pay a travel agent to do it for me. The vouchers had been paid to fly to Thailand but when I went to redeem them they didn't even get me to Bali. The flight was 2 hours late in leaving, the staff on the plane were adequate. I was happy we were on a Dreamliner 787 for all the good features it delivers. I paid extra for an exit row so I could stand up and avoid a third DVT. In fact the knowledge that I could fly on a 787 both ways confirmed that I would go to Bali. On the return trip, Jetstar changed the aircraft to a A321LR Neo, a narrow bodied smaller plane with no entertainment and a minimum of space to stand and exercise. All previous seat booking disappeared so I tried to again book exit rows. The Jetstar webpage interface was so unaccommodating that it was difficult to execute this so I missed out on the two that were available. I think it is pertinent that I wouldn't even have known the plane had changed except that my travel agent had sent me an email. I received nothing from Jetstar. When I finally did books some seats and Jetstar emailed me my new itinerary, it indicated that I now had no checked luggage even though I had paid for it. As it turned out other people were sent the same information but none of us new it was going to be ok. I tried to contact Jetstar on their website chat, but after 20 mins waiting I gave up, but I'm sure I'm important to them.

2022,"Worst airline I travelled with in in my life. Had a holiday in Queenstown, New Zealand and booked a Scoot flight to Sydney from Singapore, and a Jetstar flight to Queenstown from Sydney. At the start of my trip, I faced no issues entering Sydney with my valid Australian Electronic Travel Authority (ETA), and was promptly cleared by immigration. After which, I took my Jetstar flight to Queenstown, and did not encounter any issue as well. At the end of my Queenstown holiday, I arrived promptly at Queenstown airport to check-in for my Jetstar flight back to Sydney (where I would then take a Scoot flight a couple of hours later from Sydney to my final destination - Singapore). At the Jetstar check-in counter at Queenstown airport, I was asked to present my Australian ETA which I did, and was told by the Jetstar staff that there was an issue with my ETA, because my full name was stated in the Family name field, and told me to apply for a new ETA right then and there. Flabbergasted, (as I had not encountered an issue with my ETA that had allowed me entry into Australia twice before, most recent being the start of my holiday AND my ETA only expired in Mar 2023) I did as I was told and started to apply for a new ETA using the Australian ETA app. As retrieval of passport information via the app is by scanning the chip in the passport, my Full Name auto-populated in the Family name field (and could not be edited). Even on the app, it explicitly said ""For some passport types, the applicants given name will appear in the family name field Please do not rescan the applicants passport in these cases as the information is displaying correctly"". I highlighted this to the Jetstar staff and was then told to NOT use the app to apply for a new ETA, and to do via the website instead, which went contrary to what was written on the website ""From 6 April 2022, all ETA-eligible passport holders can now apply for an ETA using the Australian ETA app At this time, ETA lodgement is only available through the Australian ETA app"". Long story short, as I was not able to reconcile this alleged issue at check-in, the Jetstar staff informed that she would not be able to check me in for my flight, and hence I missed my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, which meant that I also missed my Scoot flight from Sydney back to Singapore. Given that I had to return to Singapore ASAP, I had to spend about SGD$2000 for a one-way last-minute flight ticket back to Singapore from Queenstown, and also spent about SGD$300+ for an unintended additional night's stay in Queenstown given that the next available flight was the next day. Lodged a complaint to Jetstar requesting for an explanation, and was informed that it would take up to 15 days for the Resolutions team to get back to me. 15 days came and gone and I again followed up with Jetstar, who informed that it would take another 5 days to process. 5 days have passed and I have yet to receive any word from Jetstar.

2022,"I will never fly with Jetstar again. They moved my flight without telling me then when I called customer service they yelled at me. Flights delayed a day, then another day, then an hour, then another 15 at the airport. They took away my checked baggage when they changed my flight and wouldn't reinstate it. Then they quoted me $17 per 10kg, then when i got to the service desk in the airport they charged either $50 for an extra 7kg of carry on or $45 for 15kg of checked baggage. When going through TSA I was scanned, asked to take my shoes off, even though I had previously asked the TSA if I had to, they said no. Took my shoes off and was body scanned again, then was accused of hiding something in my armpit!? In the 2 minutes it took me to take my shoes off and put on the conveyer line? They kept insisting I should go somewhere private for it, but I had nothing to hide and they were only making me late for my flight (all good though, cos it was delayed again). Nothing came up in the search, obviously. They then pulled my bag aside to pull apart then decided they wouldn't. Flight delayed again. Each time another delay I failed to get an email to update me of the change. A friend caught a Jetstar flight the same day and they delayed her flight twice, even while on the plane, and the staff misprinted 3 passengers tickets so they had to reprint their tickets while they waited.  I have had to spend an extra 410 on a flight I originally booked weeks and weeks ago (I even had insurance but they refused to refund me).

The trainee looked like he had never seen a computer before and was receiving detailed instruction, key press by key press. Average processing time was about 15-20 mins per passenger, so even though only 4 people in the queue ahead of me, waiting time of over an hour to be served. Most of the people behind me gave up in exasperation and tried to find other ways to get on the plane before it took off without them Had plenty of time to observe the interaction of other staff between themselves and with customers. Their demeanor, professionalism and concern for customer satisfaction approximated what I would expect from prison inmates on day work release. The seats were in a 2-3-2 configuration and on any other airline that I have flown on would be described as premium economy. On my seat the recline and footrest buttons were jammed and inoperable.

2022,"I just happened to check the app a few days before leaving Honolulu to come home to Sydney and saw it changed to Hawaiian airlines. They had put us on Hawaiian and of course with that went my exit row, meal, 30kg baggage. Ended up in the back row of Hawaiian with limited recline next to a toilet (this is why I like an exit row so I can get out). Hawaiian was great though, crew and service was 10/10. No communication from Jetstar and because they changed us to Hawaiian all my baggage limit went from 30kg to 23 in line with the new airlines. Not Hawaiians fault but a shock since we had been shopping. Had to go on line to get a refund of the seats and meals we paid and Jetstar refused to give me a refund on the baggage which is odd since we paid for 30KG and got 23kg. I was just done with spending an hour on chat with them. Some people didn't get notified about the change in times so one lady we met spent from 5 am til 1250pm at airport waiting for Hawaiian. I wont touch them again. They are really a messy airline. On the way up in Business the crew were all over the place.

On our flight back to the United States, there was no communication telling us we needed Australian visas for our layover. We spent another hour and a half at the customer service desk. Because of our layover in Sydney, they are making us claim our bags in the Sydney Airport and then pay another big amount to recheck our bags in to fly to Honolulu. This airline is a scam.

When she realised her mistake not only did she pretend it was being fixed but when I asked the service counter they said the same - three of them standing around having a gab, not a single one checked anything but they were happy to assure me that it was sorted out. Shocker, my suitcase never showed up and since then the baggage services at Sydney airport have confirmed it was never tagged and never even left Sydney airport. Even though it's still there Jetstar have made zero attempt to locate it, a potential match was found a week ago and I had to send someone to the airport to sort things out for me when it became clear the counter staff aren't bothered to do their jobs.

It took the airline 3 weeks to locate whereabouts of my luggage and now its saying I need to organize with the airport to get the bags sent to my home address which is located in another city. What is even worse is their customer support. You cannot be put through to the case manager only they can reach you but they never managed to dial my number correctly.

The staff on and off the airplane is same as their service maybe barring a few. My luggage didn't arrive as well to Melbourne. My seat was booked for some other passenger as well, meaning they issued 2 boarding passes for 1 seat. The same happened with my friend travelling with me. They charge you the money first and immediately say, sorry we don't have what you ordered can i provide something else. In a international flight of 13 hrs (including connection), there was no option of having a meal on board( when booked through 3rd party) and when you ask for food during the flight, it will definitely take more than an hour to serve you. The staff handling the luggage was on the same line unapologetic and rude. Told me this is normal. Its a disgrace for other airlines to be sharing pathways with this terrible airline.

When i told them that i cannot board a flight to some airport and then take a cab to Melbourne to catch the connecting flight. Neither did they agree to pay for fare i had to pay neither did they assure me that the flight wont leave without me if i could not manage everything in 2 hrs. Horrible experience, i hope no one has to go through what i had to.

Ive had canceled flights before and I am a flexible traveler but a flight has never been cancelled less than an hour before takeoff and with no support about how to get to my final destination. I have been screwed out of thousands of dollars because I cant get to my destination or get any reimbursement or refunds on accommodations. The woman helping on the phone was not helpful and wanted me to fly to a different part of the country to somehow arrive at my destination an entire 24 hours later and thought this made sense. She refused to allow my to talk to anyone else and said I had to cancel my flight and basically figure everything out myself.

Again there was no staff at the baggage area for us to ask. Eventually some passengers managed to contact the staff to report our lost luggage. They told us that our luggage were still in Singapore and they may arrive the next day. By the time we completed the report, it was close to 11 pm. We stayed the night at the Kuala Lumpur airport hotel hoping that we can pick up the luggage the next day instead of having the luggage delivered to us since we have chocolate which may melt in the heat.

2022,"This is the worst airline I have ever had dealings with. Many years ago I had booked and paid $130.00 for a flight from Gold Coast to Sydney. On the way to the airport I was held up by road-works, however I arrived at the airport at 4minutes to 3 oclock. There was no one at the checkin counter so I had to wait about 6 minutes before an airline employee came to attend the counter. When he found out that I was booked on the 3-30 flight he informed me that I would not be able to board the flight even though the flight had not been called and I had no baggage whatsoever. He told me I could take the next flight if paid a new fare of $150,00. He informed that I had lost my money. I returned home and the next day I flew out on Virgin Blue from Brisbane Airport. No money was ever refunded even though it is illegal for airlines to retain the airport taxes. I thought that this firm may have improved, and it was convenient I booked a flight from Gold Coast last Friday 13th of May. I noted that the employees were all very dictatorial, but it seemed OK. The flight departed about 12 minutes late and so it also arrived in Sydney late. The flight time to Sydney was 1hour and 7 minutes. After landing the plane commenced travelling to the terminal, but then stopped. After this it did move a few times. The pilot eventually informed us that there was another plane at our gate refuelling. After 1hour and 37 minutes of sitting on the ground the aircraft arrived at the gate. That is flight time was 1hour and 7 minutes and time spent freezing on the taxiway was 1 hour 37 minutes. On last Monday 16th May we began our return journey being booked on a flight departing Sydney at 6-40pm. Everything went to plan until just before departure, passengers were already entering the aircraft, when 3 airline staff came to weigh our tiny bags. They found that our bags (including our wallets) exceeded their weight limit of 7kg by about 2.1kg. We were 2 passengers so the total weight was 16.1kg. They demanded that we pay $65 each even though one passengers bag was less than 7kg. Eventually I removed my toothbrush and pyjamas to get the total weight down to 13.9kg.",1,0.9994977712631226,1

As I got onto the flight the crew member stopped me and told me to leave my bag next to her, as it is slightly bigger in size to put it in over the seat bag compartment. I asked, so where will my bag be placed at and she said it'll be placed below the plane, I said ok as long it's safe. She said she'll get it back to me, she asked for my seat number. I waited, she did not come to me to notify me about my bag. Well, I trusted her as a staff and crew member of the flight of Jetstar. Reached Sydney, as I was getting down, I asked her, what happened to my bag, and she said someone from the baggage will page my name for my bag. Well, again I trusted her words and waited at the baggage area, my bag not to be seen, went to check at the Jetstar baggage counter, explained to she and she checked and she gave me a paper with baggage service reference number. I waited more than one hour, looking and waiting for my bag, 2nd I put my trust on the crew member.

So lucky my husband woke up and saw the message, and we spent three hours in the crazy hours of the morning trying to find another flight that would get us to Cairns on the same day. The lack of flight choice without ridiculous stopovers was appalling. And thanks to the airline, we lost an entire day of our trip. But thats not all. Before we left for our honeymoon, Jetstar told us that our flight home was rescheduled to be earlier. Which was disappointing because we were going to lose another day of our honeymoon. And once again, this morning we received a message in the middle of the night, telling us our flight (JQ941) has been delayed. Well, our hotel front reception werent in until 9am to help rearrange a later shuttle bus, so we had to suck it up and head to the airport to wait four hours for our flight. But then, about 10 minutes before our new boarding time, the departures sign showed that our flight would be further delayed by another two hours. So basically, thats over 6 hours of us dragging around the airport, wasting our time and holiday. Im currently in Cairns airport as I write this, trying to get back home to Melbourne, really upset. Wheres the communication? No text, no email, the app is all incorrect information. Wheres the staff that we can talk to? And with all the delays put together, its literally back to the original flight time we had when we booked. If we had known this earlier than 4am, then we could have spent another day enjoying our honeymoon.

Support staff are unable to help due to garbage policies. No compensation given. They kept saying we value getting you to where you need to to but their policies are the exact opposite. Lots of customer care speak, but when push comes to shove they are an incompetent, greedy airline who care very little about you. Lesson learned: never fly Jetstar.",1,0.9997093081474304,1

I was lucky and able to get on a flight later in the evening however some people were told they couldnt get on until the next day. Further to this, the flight I was moved to then was delayed by 40 min and then after arriving at my destination we waited for over 40 min in the aircraft as we were unable to disembark.

I said I wanted to get off and he said ok, give me your ticket and I'll get your bags even if it meant holding up the flight for 1hr? He then found a seat for me front row bulkhead in the middle which reluctantly accepted due to a business meeting I had next morning overseas.

The resulting invoice, however, contained the following terms which I'm guessing few passengers would understand: Fare Credit Payment Fee Spoilage Fee System Error Fee Call Center Offset - Spoilage Fee It seems that these are 'creative accounting' terms used to avoid making refunds when passengers change to a lower lost fare. A brief search of the Internet revealed that I'm not the only passenger wondering exactly what these terms mean (beyond the fact that the passenger should pay).

I had flown JetStar short haul before and found it average, so when i was returning from Melbourne I decided to purchase the starter Max fare. (The Jetstar Short haul business class equivalent) the price was reasonable. i was driven to the airport in a private car (not part of Jetstar business class,) there was water and free mints. i arrived at terminal 4 on the way in i found a WHsmith store and bought a Jetstar A320 model plane. once i had checked in I tried to ask a Jetstar staff member about how to acess the food voucher the staff member was rude so i asked another staff member who answered my question. To go to the lounge i had to walk all the way to terminal 1 to find the Qantas lounge. they offered plates of salami and fruit but i went to the hot meal area, I got pasta bolognese and outrageously tiny piece of cake. I realised that the departure time was earlier than expected so i had to head to the gate the terminal where my gate was was appalling the ceilings were low and the gate was packed i got in line we got through the plane via stairs (the A320 is smaller than i thought) i got in through the front my seat was 2F at the front I got on and the plane taxied to the runway we took off (its quiet at the front) when we were at cruising altitude the crew started serving food and beverages. I had a voucher for free food it was a dinner flight but unfortunately it didn't offer meals.

I questioned her on this as i said but Qantas and Jetstar are the one company and you are the ones who cancelled the flight not me. To which she retorted `You were the one who chose Jetstar'. So then after she calculates the difference and i think this is so wrong from all levels of customer service I instead asked for a flight with Jetstar for the Sunday which is a direct flight to my destination (no transfers as I cant trust them to get it right a 3rd time). So my question to Jetstar is why such long waiting time on the phone? Even after midnight? Is the Call centre in Mumbai as only one time out of the 3 times I called I got a clearly spoken customer service agent that resolved my problem swiftly and courteously. Why do you hire Customer service agents who cannot express them selves clearly, have no aptitude or problem solving skills or desire to help the customer. This is terrible for your business as I will not book with Jetstar again to sit in a phone line 2.5hrs average is just unacceptable. Last minute changes and no apologies and rude customer service agents who can't articulate themselves properly, have attitude and down right rude. My biggest gripe is why cant I change these flights online myself?

Believe me, the reasons is not Covid19. Instead of giving me a refund, Jetstar just offered me a voucher (still haven't received anything yet). Because it's really important for me to go I decided to pay $300 to go with Air New Zealand.

Of course one more voucher because they don't want to give me back my money! So now I'm stuck in the South Island and my only option is to go back with Air New Zealand paying an extra $400.

They then direct you to a 'chat with us' system that doesn't work and if you chose to get the voucher you still lose the Webjet booking fee and the voucher cannot be used to re-book the flight with Jetstar on another flight on the same day because it takes 2 weeks to issue. What they are trying to do is to get the travelling public to do their work by listing flights that they never intend to fly, letting people book, then cancelling the flights which force those people to re-book onto any remaining flights (usually Jetstar) and then because they can't use the voucher to re-book they are going to be forced to use this disgusting airline again within the next 12 months or lose their money.

2020,"Worst customer service ever. I am writing this on behalf of my dad who was meant to fly from Perth to Melbourne this morning 8am to get to Melbourne in time for a meeting tonight at 6pm. However the flight got cancelled and apparently the only flight available to rebook him on isnt until 3:15pm this afternoon with Qantas, meaning he will miss his meeting. This only flight available however is a load of lies as there was another Qantas flight available at 9:15 plus multiple virgin flights but apparently its impossible to book onto these flights. So I suggested how about I personally book him onto one of these flights, because For some reason they cant do that, and they pay the difference in price but no, they cant do that either.  I get that its a budget airline but at the very least you would expect them to put them to rebook passengers on time appropriate flights when they are the reason passengers cant catch their original flights.  Absolutely appalling service by people who despite being a budget airline do not care about the little people, only the weight of what is in their pocket.",1,0.9997046589851379,1

All passenger claimed and left. Waited another 1 hour Jetstar representative confirmed 4 times with my baggage ticket number that's it's arrived please wait. Requested to send to hotel was refused.

2020,Hobart to Sydney. Jetstar is purely money-oriented company! They did not refund airfares to Chinese traveller who are banned from getting into Australia due to the outbreak of the prevailing virus. Other flights & hotels have the same non-refundable policy. However they did refund money to customers. It shows the characters of Jetstar. Booked two Jetstar flights via expedia. Didn't have any experience with Jetstar before.

2020,"Melbourne to Tokyo via Gold Coast. Appalling experience that will be my last, given that I return from Japan this week. My flight was canceled at Melbourne airport on the day The flight was supposed to depart, just after I drove 5 hours from my hometown. I then spent around 6 hours with 4 different calls to Jetstar trying to sort it out, as they were refusing to talk to passengers at the airport. They rescheduled my flight the following day and said that I would have my extra legroom that I had booked in advance. Got on the flight the following day to Japan and was put in a regular seat and Im a person who is 187cm tall. Worst flight of my life. Felt awful after arriving in Japan. This all happened on the 10/12/2019 when there was a global outage which was said by the staff on the day some 3 hours after my flight was scheduled to leave. Thank you Jetstar. Will never consider you for another flight and will let everyone I know know that they shouldnt fly Jetstar either.",1,0.9996349811553955,1
2020,Flew with Jetstart to Bali back in May 2019 and they cancelled our flight home to Melbourne and couldn't get us on a flight for 10 days back to Melbourne. My husband and I missed two days of work and spent approximately $1400 with another airline to get home. Jetstar refused to refund our flight and would only give us a voucher. Had no desire to ever travel with them again but then would have forfeited the $720 voucher. Ended up using the voucher to go to Hobart for the weekend. Jetstar cancelled out flight going home to Melbourne. Spent 40 minutes on the phone trying to get another flight home. Got one 9 hours later then that flight was delayed by 40 minutes Arrived home at 1.30am and had to get up for work at 6.15am so extremely tired for work that day. Have had a couple of flights with Jetstar over the years and every single one has been delayed. Will never fly with them again.

2020,"Booked a flight from Brisbane to Tokyo for the end of March. Within a month, the flight itinerary changed three times. At first the changes were only be a few minutes. Then I received a change a few days (dates before and/or after the original booking). I do not live in Brisbane, which means I would have had to either pay to change my connecting flights, or pay for several nights accommodation. Also, it affects my Tokyo accommodation. Due to the frequent changes, I could not gamble on whether Jetstar would stick with the new proposed dates or suddenly switch them again. I understand that flights are set to change, and this is forewarned upon booking but the sheer frequency and drastic shifts are unsettling - especially being so close to the departure dates. I requested a refund, which I was permitted. Then followed up by filing a complaint. The complaint was handled by automated sympathy messages and a declaration that it is not Jetstars responsibility as it is already outlined in the policy. These changes can end up costing travelings severely to change flights, book and rearrange accommodations, and other expenses.",1,0.9985028505325317,1
2020,"Flew Sydney to Melbourne - JQ527, then scheduled to fly to Perth on JQ970 two weeks later. SYD - MEL flight was good, and I can't see myself ever paying extra to fly QF or VA for an hour hop. Everything had to be paid for, but honestly, I didn't mind - you close your eyes and you're there. Seats themselves were not very well padded, but that's to be expected. Legroom was ideal, coming from a semi-tall bloke. Bags came out quickly, had an on-time departure and arrival, service was great. That's to be expected, and from someone who had never flown them before, I felt that what everyone always says about them is misguided - it's a budget airline after all. We took the Skybus from St Kilda to Tullamarine - the last of the day @ 8 pm, so we had to wait around the airport for a bit. However, for a $20.50 fare for two adults (special), the convenience and not having to catch public transport was worth it. Check-in at Tullamarine was easy, as was bag drop, went through security, only to find our flight had been cancelled due to the crew timing out (read - legally worked too long that shift to be able to operate the onward flight) - so, back through the terminal and waiting in a line for help. Thank god we got there when we did, because the queue stretched for ages right after we arrived. The good thing is, it's super easy to change your flight when it's cancelled. We originally changed our flight to a 6:05 am departure with Jetstar, but seeing the provided accommodation was in Preston - a good 45mins away by taxi, we tried to get a better flight - also seeing that people had been able to change to Qantas flights. They are constantly loading more flights and options into the system in the event of a cancellation, so we asked to see if there was anything better they could do for us, and it turns out that there was a Virgin flight the next day leaving at 9AM. This suited us, and we were set. The accommodation they provided was great - fairly modern and gave us meal vouchers to use at the hotel - we used them for breakfast, which was okay, but I would use them for dinner depending on when you need to go there if you're in the same situation. They also reimburse you for any taxi services you need to get to and from the airport - however you need to coordinate this yourself after the journey is done. However, the lady coordinating the giving out of hotels at Tullamarine was rude. Too sassy for her own good, we tried making conversation with her and all she could do was give snarky comments back - when she was literally doing her scheduled job (write people's names down on a list), at her normal shift time. We're the ones being delayed here - you're getting paid. Cut the attitude. However, everyone else at the service desk was friendly, which was good. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Jetstar again given my experience on the first flight, but it's also good knowing they have a good system for cancellations - you're covered even if they're unable to fly. And, for paying $150pp incl bag, getting a free hotel, taxi service, and a widebody Virgin flight the next day with inc food and entertainment was great value for money. Thanks for cancelling my second flight, Jetstar. It couldn't have gone better, for me at least :)",0,0.7012810111045837,1
2020,Honolulu to Hobart via Sydney. Jetstar took my money for bags and seat assignments then changed my flight to a Qantas flight and told me I could not get any seat assignments until I check in day of.

2020,"Queenstown to Auckland. Our experience with Jetstar Airways on a flight in New Zealand was very disappointing due to the disruption in the flight, the subsequent lack of communication, and the promises of staff that were not supported by corporate. Jetstar experienced a countrywide failure in their computer systems causing manual processing leading to delayed flights. Our flight was delayed over 4 hours causing our connection to the US to be missed. There was no later flight, so an overnight stay was required. There was no communication about status - the flight boards were not updated. In fact the board showed that we had arrived, when in fact we hadn't even left. I was not able to pursue changes with the connecting flight airlines because they showed the flight on time.  Upon arrival in Auckland I was informed we would be transported to a hotel and provide meals. Later I was told the transportation would not be provided but we could take the Skybus and submit expenses for reimbursement. I asked if there was more than one hotel for the brand and was told no. When I got to the Skybus counter, I was asked which of the two hotels for that brand. I went back to the ticket counter to get the specific location, and by the time I returned we had missed the bus. Upon arrival in Auckland there was a long (1km) walk to the hotel. Upon checking out the next day we were advised that the hotel was paid, and a $30 credit for meals was applied. The latter in direct conflict with written policy that it should've been $60 and further that the airport representative stated that would not be limited to $60. Upon return to the airport the next day, there was no one available to handle the reimbursement request so we submitted the request for expense reimbursement online ($167). After waiting over a week past the processing timeline I followed up via chat. At which time I was advised that they would not support reimbursement of any kind despite the statement of staff. No avenue for escalation was provided. I accessed their chat complaint system, uploading all of the original documents supporting the reimbursement request. I was on the chat for 2 and  hrs. and asked redundant questions and then to be advised there is no reimbursement. At one point the individual stated there is no reimbursement when in home city, which was blatantly wrong as it was clear my home city is in the US. Thankfully, Jetstar did arrange and pay for the hotel as they obviously acknowledged the need. But the rest of the response was not worthy of your trust and patronage.",1,0.9996975660324097,1

2020,"Sydney to Hobart. I had booked with confidence as this is a Qantas subsidiary. Arrived at the counter and one has to check in and also tag their own bags. I had no problem once I was able to find a working kiosk and one that was available. The lines were unbelievably long due to most people having no idea how to check in at the kiosk and were dumbfounded with the bag tag. It was mass chaos and no one from JetStar assisting in any way. I had done my research and paid for my extra baggage and carry-ons before arrival. By the time you pay for the extras, believe me, I spent much more than if I just flew Qantas or Virgin. But Jetstar had the flight schedule I needed. Arrived at the gate, weighed my carry-on and the customer service rep tagged my bag. We sat there and sat there. No plane, no announcements. Then about 200 other passengers descended upon our gate. Something was up. No gate agents at the desk. Finally an announcement of a gate change. I move to the new gate. There is a plane. We sit for another 30 minutes, I'm suspect there is a problem as we are scheduled to fly an A321 and an A320 is at the gate, which will not accommodate all the passengers. Suddenly, I watch all of the gate agents pack up and leave. No announcement, nothing. They just walk away and disappear. Again, I get up and walk over to the departures board and see that again we have a new gate. I go back and announce it to those of us sitting at a gate. We all move to the new gate per the board. An announcement was never made of the gate change and passengers were running all over the place, confused, furious - mass chaos. Finally we board. I'm sitting in the first row 1A, extra room seat and I paid the premium for it. I notice that I'm sitting in a wet seat and the carpeting is soaked and squishy. The cabin manager, who is professional, gregarious and superlative in customer service briefs us on operating the emergency exit and then we sit and wait. We sit and we sit. The PA of the plane is not working. The cabin crew notices the water and the wet carpet. Mechanics determine that due to the heavy rains, someone left the door open and the water affected the electrics of the PA system. We sit as they try to fix it. Of course the plane is taken out of service, and our cabin crew is now illegal and we disembark. We gather again in the gate, and remarkably a new plane was promised and delivered. At this point, the gate agents were finally competent and doing their jobs. I have to say I found the cabin crews to be excellent and I felt very safe flying Jet Star. The hassle one experiences at the gate is absurd to say the least. Flying is bad enough on a full service carrier, so why torture yourself with JetStar. The check-in process is ridiculous and something I'll never forget.",1,0.9993096590042114,1

2020,"Cairns to Perth via Darwin. As a budget subsidiary of Qantas. I was expecting Jetstar to be half decent. Next time Id rather just pay the extra $100 to go on a Virgin plane and get everything included. With Jetstar, you have to pay for checked baggage and for seat selection and meals which adds to the cost and it somehow ends up being more expensive than Virgin or Qantas. The flight I was on JQ 920, was scheduled to leave Cairns at 0850 and arrive in Darwin at 1125. A Jetstar employee notified customers that the flight was delayed by half an hour. 20 minutes later, the same message was repeated meaning the flight had been delayed by an hour. Then I got a notification on my phone saying that the flight wasnt going to leave until 1650!! This was bad news for me as I had a connecting flight out of Darwin. I then spoke to both Jetstar and Qantas customer services and they couldnt put me onto another flight combination (even though there were at least 20 seats on two Qantas planes back home, I googled it). The customer service, in my opinion handled it very poorly and only offered me accommodation in Darwin. I needed to get home urgently for an appointment the next day but they couldnt care less, no sympathy shown at all.
