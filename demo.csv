"Was assigned last two row at seat 39F with their new A321NEO aircraft. The seat pitch is generous and comfortable. Delayed one hour due to late arriving aircraft from SIN. The flight was full.

"Very rude male flight attendant. Accessed the rear toilet onboard after being ushered in by a female fight attendant. Upon starting to use the toilet (after about 15 seconds) there was a very load banging on the door. As I started to stop proceedings and get presentable the banging noise increased and so I rushed to get out asap. As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable. Extremely poor passenger consideration.",0
"Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions. A disgrace to Singapore.",0
"We had a thoroughly unpleasant experience checking in for a Scoot flight at Singapore Changi Airport. We had already checked in online, and arrived at the airport to collect physical boarding passes and drop-off luggage. When we arrived, we were unable to print the boarding passes at the automated stations and approached several counter staff for help. Instead of assisting us, we were repeatedly told to ""just queue"". However, when we reached the front of the queue, we were told that check in for our flight had closed and refused to let us board. They referred us to another counter, where we were blamed for not approaching them earlier and were again refused boarding. We finally escalated the issue to a manager, who realised that we had already checked in online and needed to get to the gate quickly for boarding. We rushed over and made our flight. Although we made our flight, our Scoot experience was a complete nightmare. The counter staff were unhelpful, unpleasant and in desperate need of proper training.",0
"I have to say that I didn't go into the flights with Scoot with high expectations, but at the end of the day, they were truly fantastic flights. The staff were fantastic on all 4 flights, there wasn't much food, but it was very tasty, the planes were comfortable and modern, and overall, I can only rate it positively. People expect a lot of luxury for little money, but for that price, it was really great service.",1

As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions.

"We had a thoroughly unpleasant experience checking in for a Scoot flight at Singapore Changi Airport. We had already checked in online, and arrived at the airport to collect physical boarding passes and drop-off luggage. When we arrived, we were unable to print the boarding passes at the automated stations and approached several counter staff for help. Instead of assisting us, we were repeatedly told to ""just queue"". However, when we reached the front of the queue, we were told that check in for our flight had closed and refused to let us board. They referred us to another counter, where we were blamed for not approaching them earlier and were again refused boarding. We finally escalated the issue to a manager, who realised that we had already checked in online and needed to get to the gate quickly for boarding. We rushed over and made our flight. Although we made our flight, our Scoot experience was a complete nightmare. The counter staff were unhelpful, unpleasant and in desperate need of proper training.",0
"I have to say that I didn't go into the flights with Scoot with high expectations, but at the end of the day, they were truly fantastic flights.

"Very rude male flight attendant. Accessed the rear toilet onboard after being ushered in by a female fight attendant. Upon starting to use the toilet (after about 15 seconds) there was a very load banging on the door. As I started to stop proceedings and get presentable the banging noise increased and so I rushed to get out asap. As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable.

We had already checked in online, and arrived at the airport to collect physical boarding passes and drop-off luggage. When we arrived, we were unable to print the boarding passes at the automated stations and approached several counter staff for help. Instead of assisting us, we were repeatedly told to ""just queue"". However, when we reached the front of the queue, we were told that check in for our flight had closed and refused to let us board. They referred us to another counter, where we were blamed for not approaching them earlier and were again refused boarding. We finally escalated the issue to a manager, who realised that we had already checked in online and needed to get to the gate quickly for boarding. We rushed over and made our flight. Although we made our flight, our Scoot experience was a complete nightmare. The counter staff were unhelpful, unpleasant and in desperate need of proper training.",0
"I have to say that I didn't go into the flights with Scoot with high expectations, but at the end of the day, they were truly fantastic flights. The staff were fantastic on all 4 flights, there wasn't much food, but it was very tasty, the planes were comfortable and modern, and overall, I can only rate it positively. People expect a lot of luxury for little money, but for that price, it was really great service.",1
"Was assigned last two row at seat 39F with their new A321NEO aircraft. The seat pitch is generous and comfortable. Delayed one hour due to late arriving aircraft from SIN. The flight was full. I just realized after the FA perform the safety demonstration, because we have a long taxi to runway 33 KUL, duo FA nonstop chatting loud at back galley. Their inflight portal scoothub also can’t connect.",1
"Very rude male flight attendant. Accessed the rear toilet onboard after being ushered in by a female fight attendant. Upon starting to use the toilet (after about 15 seconds) there was a very load banging on the door. As I started to stop proceedings and get presentable the banging noise increased and so I rushed to get out asap. As I opened the door the male flight attendant yelled ""get out"" and pushed past me to look in the toilet. I mentioned to him that he was quite rude and went back to my seat near the middle of the aircraft. My wife asked me what happened as she heard the banging from her seat. I understand that at times passengers may be required to return to their seats or leave a toilet for some other reason but to start banging loudly on the door for half of the passengers onboard to hear with no other communication and then yell at a passenger for no apparent reason is totally unacceptable. Extremely poor passenger consideration.",0
"Upon check-in to Phuket airport, I could see the flight had been delayed. When I advised ground staff that this would mean I would most likely miss my connecting flight in Singapore (dep 1am) through to Melbourne which would cause onward delays (including an unplanned overnight stay), and could they assist by allowing me to move to the front of the plane, or communicate with Singapore ground staff, they advised nothing could be done and that I could sort it at Singapore Changi airport. As it was, the plane was further delayed and the connecting flight was well and truly missed. As I was seated at the very back of the plane, & I could not exit from the rear, I was last off the plane, which meant I was at the back of a very long line which took 2 hours (1am - 3am Singapore time) for me to arrive at the counter in Singapore. I was told I would be on a flight at 11am to MEL. I explained that the arrival time into MEL 2130 meant that I could not get my connections across Victoria into South Australia where I live, and rather than use a hotel for the time in SIN, could I have one for late arrival into MEL. I was told there was nothing to be done and to keep all receipts and send to Scoot. As it turns out, 2 weeks after returning, 9 emails, and 4 phone calls later, Scoot said that because the flight is under 2 hours delayed, they do not cover it. This is untrue as the flight was delayed more than that. The point being that I missed my connection, leaving me arriving solo, late at night into a city I do not live in. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times and cannot fault them. Scoot is an entirely horrible experience from start to finish and I will never recommend or fly with them again, and I will be very vocal about how poor the experience was. No communication from ground staff ever - flights out and in were all delayed and staff looked unhappy, and I would imagine are also poorly treated by also receiving no communication from above, and poor conditions.
